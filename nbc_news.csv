" The world is set to add nearly 290 gigawatts of renewable power capacity this year, according to the International Energy Agency, with the Paris-based organization expecting 2021 to “set a fresh all-time record for new installations.” Published on Wednesday, the IEA’s Renewables Market Report forecasts that the planet’s renewable electricity capacity will jump to more than 4,800 GW by the year 2026, an increase of over 60 percent compared with 2020 levels. Capacity refers to the maximum amount of energy that installations can produce, not what they’re necessarily generating. China is set to be the main driver of renewable capacity growth in the coming years, according to the IEA, with Europe, the U.S. and India following on behind. Looking at the bigger picture, the IEA said renewables are expected to account for “almost 95 percent of the increase in global power capacity through 2026.” “We have revised up our forecast from a year earlier,” the report said, “as stronger policy support and ambitious climate targets announced for COP26 outweigh the current record commodity prices that have increased the costs of building new wind and solar PV installations.” Solar PV refers to solar photovoltaic, a way of directly converting sunlight into electricity. The IEA’s executive director, Fatih Birol, said 2021′s record renewable electricity additions were “yet another sign that a new global energy economy is emerging.” “The high commodity and energy prices we are seeing today pose new challenges for the renewable industry, but elevated fossil fuel prices also make renewables even more competitive,” Birol said. While the headline figures from Wednesday’s report appear promising, a multitude of headwinds could buffet the sector. The IEA’s report acknowledged this, noting that renewables face a “range of policy uncertainties and implementation challenges.” These include everything from permitting and financing to grid integration and social acceptance.  “Current increases in commodity prices have put upward pressure on investment costs, while the availability of raw materials and rising electricity prices in some markets pose additional challenges for wind and solar PV manufacturers in the short term,” the IEA said. Nevertheless, the effects of “volatile commodity and transport prices on demand are expected to be limited,” with high prices for fossil fuels further boosting the competitiveness of both solar PV and wind. When it comes to net-zero goals, the picture is perhaps even more challenging. While capacity additions for renewables are on course to “grow faster than ever in the next five years,” this would not be enough to meet the IEA’s scenario for net-zero emissions by 2050. Even the IEA’s “accelerated case,” in which governments tackle challenges related to regulation, policy and implementation, would not be enough. “Annual capacity growth under the IEA Net Zero Scenario during 2021-2026 needs to be 80 percent faster than in our accelerated case, implying that governments need to not only address policy and implementation challenges, but also to increase their ambition,” the report said. This sobering tone echoes previous statements from the IEA. In October, it claimed that clean energy progress remained “far too slow to put global emissions into sustained decline towards net zero.” In a sign of how much work needs to be done, the IEA’s World Energy Outlook described how a “rapid but uneven economic recovery from last year’s Covid‐induced recession” had put significant strains on the energy system. This had sparked “sharp price rises in natural gas, coal and electricity markets.” “For all the advances being made by renewables and electric mobility, 2021 is seeing a large rebound in coal and oil use,” the report continued. “Largely for this reason, it is also seeing the second‐largest annual increase in CO2 emissions in history.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories."
" BANGOR, Maine (AP) — University of Maine researchers are trying to produce potatoes that can better withstand warming temperatures as the climate changes. Warming temperatures and an extended growing season can lead to quality problems and disease, Gregory Porter, a professor of crop ecology and management, told the Bangor Daily News. “The predictions for climate change are heavier rainfall events, and potatoes don’t tolerate flooding or wet conditions for long without having other quality problems,” Porter said. “If we want potatoes to be continued to be produced successfully in Maine, we need to be able to produce varieties that can be resistant to change.” Around the world, research aimed at mitigating crop damage is underway. A NASA study published this month suggested climate change may affect the production of corn and wheat, with corn yields projected to decline while wheat could see potential growth, as soon as 2030 under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario. Maine is coming off of a banner potato crop thanks in part to the success of the Caribou russet, which was developed by UMaine researchers. But Porter fears that even that variety isn’t as heat tolerant as necessary to resist the future effects of climate change. Pests are another factor. The Colorado potato beetle and disease-spreading aphids have flourished with the changing climate, said Jim Dill, pest management specialist at the University of Maine Cooperative Extension. Breeding seemingly small changes like hairier leaves that make it difficult for insects to move around on the plant can cut down on pests’ destruction and also the need for pesticides, he said. Breeding such characteristics into potatoes is a long process of cross-pollinating different potato varieties. The process is well underway. They’re in a research testing phase right now at sites throughout the United States. Test potatoes in Virginia, North Carolina and Florida are testing high temperature stress. “It takes 10 years of selection after that initial cross pollination, and it might take two to five years before enough commercial evaluation has taken place to release a new potato variety,” Porter said.

" This article is part of “The Fifth Crime,” a series on ecocide published in partnership with Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, independent news outlet that covers climate, energy and the environment, and Undark Magazine, a nonprofit, editorially independent digital magazine exploring the intersection of science and society.  It was 2 a.m. and the sun was shining, as it does day and night in mid-July in Norilsk, a Siberian city 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle. Igor Klyushin went to the bank of the river where he used to fish with his father for grayling, a dorsal-finned beauty known for its graceful leaps above the surface. “A very merry fish,” Klyushin recalled. “It enjoys cold and clean, clean water.” He doubted grayling would be there that night. In any event, authorities had long warned that it was unsafe to fish for them in the Daldykan River. And besides, he wasn’t there to fish. He began to record images of the clay-colored muck flowing downriver from one of the largest metal mining and smelting complexes in the world. The discolored water represented “the latest environmental crime of Norilsk Nickel,” Klyushin said in the video he posted on “Norilchane” — or “Citizens of Norilsk” — the YouTube channel he helps moderate.The channel and its Facebook group, with about 8,300 members, have become gathering places for distressed residents of Norilsk, the northernmost city in the world. The city of 176,000 has long been recognized by environmentalists — and even by the Russian government — as one of the most polluted places on Earth, because of one business: Norilsk Nickel, the world’s biggest producer of palladium and high-grade nickel and a top producer of platinum, cobalt and copper. Built as a resource colony by prisoners in the Soviet Gulag, Norilsk outlasted communism, embraced capitalism, and it now aims to ramp up production to sell the metals needed for electric vehicle batteries and the clean energy economy. Norilsk Nickel is the world’s leading producer of the high-purity Class 1 nickel that electric vehicle industry leaders like Tesla CEO Elon Musk are seeking. The company’s ambitions coincide with those of Russian President Vladimir Putin for greater development in the Far North, which he maintains can be accomplished sustainably.  But Norilsk Nickel has undermined its own vision for the future by spoiling a priceless environment, with implications for the entire planet. The company’s pollution has carved a barren landscape of dead and dying trees out of the taiga, or boreal forest, one of the world’s largest carbon sinks. Its wastewater has turned glacial rivers red. Its smokestacks belch out the worst sulfur dioxide pollution in the world. And last year, a corroded tank burst and released 6.5 million gallons of diesel fuel into waters that flow to the Kara Sea. It was the largest oil spill in Arctic history. Although Norilsk Nickel maintains that no diesel fuel made it to the Arctic Ocean, the Russian government’s fisheries science agency told Inside Climate News that its testing showed that the contamination had reached that far. In September, Norilsk Nickel agreed to negotiate the settlement of an $800 million lawsuit that the federal fisheries agency, known as Rosrybolovstvo, filed against the company this summer over the damage to the region’s aquatic resources. Norilsk is an example of the kind of systematic and long-term devastation that has animated a global movement to make destruction of nature an international crime. The campaign aims to treat “ecocide” in the same way as genocide or crimes against humanity, offenses prosecutable by the Hague-based International Criminal Court. The ecocide campaign has drawn attention to the failure of national laws to halt severe and widespread or long-term damage that has international consequences. Norilsk is grappling with such damage, both as part of a region that is especially vulnerable to climate change and as a city reliant on an industry that has poisoned its land and water.  Norilsk Nickel maintains that it can rehabilitate its environment. It paid a $2 billion fine for last year’s diesel spill, the largest environmental penalty in the country’s history, and it has pledged to spend more than $5 billion on both pollution control and economic and social revitalization throughout its territory of Krasnoyarsk Krai.  “We do acknowledge that there are legacy issues relating to our business,” a company spokesman said in written responses to questions from Inside Climate News, referring to the problems left over from the Soviet era. “We are implementing far-reaching measures to address them.” Local government officials are enthusiastic about Norilsk Nickel’s program. The city and the territory plan to build a hospital, renovate housing and even create an Arctic Museum of Modern Art.  Krasnoyarsk Krai Gov. Alexander Uss has proposed making Norilsk the official capital of the Russian Arctic. But residents like Klyushin are skeptical, given the pollution they’ve seen even after the company paid its fine.  “When I came that night to see the Daldykan, my heart really sank, and it was broken,” Klyushin said, speaking by phone through an interpreter two weeks after he took video of the discolored water in July. “The river was red with pulp, and the chemical smell is still in my lungs.” The story of Norilsk’s pollution is written in the trees: 5.9 million acres of dead and dying boreal forest downwind from the Norilsk Nickel compound — a scar larger than New Jersey, slashed into the largest forested region on Earth.  In tree ring samples, scientists have pinpointed the great rush of sulfur dioxide pollution that began in 1942, when the first nickel smelter geared up to meet the Soviet Union’s need for stainless steel during World War II. And the tree rings have shown how the rate of forest deaths here jumped in the 1960s, from 5 percent annually to 30 percent annually at one research site, said a study that researchers from Siberian Federal University and the University of Cambridge published last year. The discovery at that time of huge new ore reserves gave Norilsk Nickel “a new lease on life,” the company noted in its official history.  By the early 1980s, all larch trees within 40 miles east of Norilsk were dead. Satellite readings show that no other human enterprise — no power plant, no oil field, no other smelter complex — generates as much sulfur dioxide pollution as Norilsk Nickel. In fact, the only entities on Earth that rival its sulfur emissions are erupting volcanoes, according to a monitoring project led by scientists at NASA and Environment Canada. At 1.9 million tons of sulfur dioxide emissions annually, Norilsk produces as much sulfur pollution as the entire U.S. — all concentrated in a city the size of Eugene, Oregon. “You cannot breathe there,” Valeriya “Lera” Bolgova, a leader of the Nganasan people, one of five Indigenous tribes of the Taimyr peninsula, said in an interview. The region’s first people have been unique witnesses to Norilsk Nickel’s indelible imprint on the environment, because fish and reindeer meat are still central to their diets.  “When the pollution proceeds, and proceeds as intensively as it is nowadays, both the fish and the animals start looking for a cleaner environment,” Bolgova said.  Researchers from Siberian Federal University affirmed that the reindeer patterns have dramatically changed on Taimyr. They found the average stay of the reindeer at their traditional summer calving and feeding place to be just 63 days, a third of what it was in the 1960s. As for human health, lung cancer mortality is 1.2 to 2.5 times higher in Norilsk than in other Russian cities, and deaths from cardiovascular disease and infectious diseases also are elevated, according to the latest research. Such elevated rates are difficult to tie to a single source, and their cause hasn’t yet been established. It is difficult to study life expectancy in Norilsk because so many people retire early and move to warmer climates, where their health outcomes aren’t captured in the city’s statistics. “They hope to start getting this higher pension and then go to the mainland and live this beautiful life,” said Klyushin, whose father and uncle were among those who left. His father died a few years ago at age 61, and his uncle died before he was 60.  Klyushin and other local environmental activists agitated for years for Rosprirodnadzor, the Russian environmental protection agency, to establish an office in Norilsk. They succeeded early last year, and the job of chief deputy went to Vasily Ryabinin, then 39, a chemist, who had previously worked at Norilsk Nickel but left after his beloved mentor at the company died of cancer, he said in an interview with Inside Climate News. Yet the warm, spring day when 6.5 million gallons of diesel fuel spilled from the Norilsk Nickel complex into the Daldykan River marked both the beginning and the end of Ryabinin’s career as an environmental enforcer for the Russian government.  In the days leading up to May 29, 2020, the temperature in the region had risen 18 degrees Fahrenheit above normal, according to one scientific study. Permafrost had begun to give way under a corroded fuel tank at Norilsk Nickel’s power plant that Russian government safety inspectors had deemed unstable two years earlier and that the company had never fixed. Ryabinin received a phone call from his boss, who had been denied entry to investigate at the nickel plant, saying red pollution had been spotted in the river. Ryabinin joined him outside the plant, but they were turned away by security, backed up by police. Ryabinin, who is both a mountaineer and a photographer, took his hiking boots and a camera and walked 2 kilometers with his boss to a nearby bridge, where they could see “an absolute mountain river” of diesel fuel spilling into the waterways, Ryabinin said. “My boss was even afraid to actually smoke, because the smell was so strong it was possible these vapors could ignite some kind of explosion,” he added.  Ryabinin told his story in a 45-minute video posted later on the Norilchane YouTube channel. His broadcast and photographs were the first account that reached the outside world about the largest known oil spill in the Arctic. If it had occurred in the U.S., it would have ranked among the country’s top 10 spills, more than half the size of the Exxon Valdez spill and six times larger than the 2010 pipeline spill of tar sands oil in the Kalamazoo River. Top Rosprirodnadzor officials flew in from Moscow. The company deployed containment booms and hundreds of workers to clean up. But Ryabinin felt it was an unwinnable race with the river current. He pressed to sample the water downstream in Lake Pyasino for contamination, but his superiors told him no transportation was available. Six days later the head of Rosprirodnadzor declared that no oil had reached the lake, which connects to the Arctic Ocean. Norilsk Nickel said the same. Ryabinin, feeling he was being prevented from determining the true extent of damage to the environment, turned in his resignation. One of Russia’s most prominent ecologists, Evgeny Shvarts of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute for Geography in Moscow, told Inside Climate News he is convinced from long experience as an environmental advocate in Russia that people can’t rely on the government for environmental protection. Shvarts has been a member of Norilsk Nickel’s board of directors since 2019, one of the independent directors the company is required to have because it is traded on the London Stock Exchange. Shvarts holds no stock in Norilsk Nickel and isn’t in the corporate chain of command under the majority shareholder, the oligarch Vladimir Potanin. Shvarts believes independent directors and other requirements of the public markets are especially important in Russia, where, he said, the government doesn’t have the tools necessary to implement environmental laws. “It is a very naive approach to think that the state always represents the public interest,” he said. After Klyushin saw pollution in the Daldykan River again in July, he notified the regulatory agencies. The Ministry of Natural Resources responded with a letter that Klyushin shared with Inside Climate News. In it, the ministry detailed Norilsk Nickel’s reported discharges into waterways for the first quarter of 2021: cobalt, 32,318 tons, or four times the legal limit; iron, 3,998 tons, or 45 times the legal limit; and nickel, 989 tons, or 100 times the legal limit. The discharges exceeded the “normative permissible standards,” the ministry said, but they were allowed under Norilsk Nickel’s permit, signed by Rosprirodnadzor, the environmental agency. The agency declined repeated requests to respond to questions for this article.  “Nornickel’s factories operate under strict environmental restrictions and a set of established permits, which are prescribed in accordance with project documentation with an assessment of permissible impact standards,” Norilsk Nickel’s spokesman said about the discharges.  Ryabinin said he wasn’t surprised about the permits or the ministry’s response. “In Russian, we have a saying: ‘It’s like throwing dried peas against the wall,’” he said. “The peas will just come right back to you. They won’t get to somebody else, to someone who is guilty of building this wall.” Putin reacted sharply to news of the diesel spill last year, which came only weeks after he unveiled a new strategic plan for the Arctic, a vision of resource development and environmental protection going hand in hand.  “Why did the authorities find out about this only two days later?” Putin asked in a video conference call with regional and company officials. “Are we going to learn about emergencies from social networks?” Fiona Hill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of books about Putin and about the long-lasting costs of the Soviet Union’s intensive development of Siberia, said about Putin, “This is him playing the role of the good czar, who has a direct connection with the people.” But, she said, Putin doubtless is also aware of how environmental disaster can breed activism and awaken dissatisfaction with the government. After the deadly 1986 Chernobyl disaster, protests in Ukraine, Belarus and Estonia morphed into a full-fledged independence movement that helped bring about the Soviet Union’s collapse. In the weeks after the Norilsk Nickel spill, five people were arrested or charged with criminal negligence, including the power plant’s director and chief engineer and Norilsk’s mayor at the time. The London-based consulting firm Environmental Resources Management, which the Norilsk Nickel board hired to investigate the accident, found that it was caused by a confluence of a changing environment, carelessness and neglect. In February, a Russian court ruled that the company should pay a fine of 146 billion rubles, or $2 billion. “We learned this lesson well,” Potanin said in a statement after the verdict. “We are carrying out the instructions of the President to eliminate the consequences of the accident and to restore the ecosystem.” Norilsk Nickel has maintained that the cleanup effort collected more than 90 percent of the leaked fuel — if true, an extraordinary recovery rate. For oil spills in marine environments, the average recovery rate is 8 percent to 10 percent, and on rivers, 50 percent would be considered high, according to experts at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Oil Spill Recovery Institute at Cordova, Alaska. Russian scientists determined that diesel fuel from the spill did reach Pyasino Lake and beyond. Contamination was found in bottom sediment in the lake and the entire 900-kilometer length of the adjoining Pyasino River, including at its mouth in the Arctic Ocean’s Kara Sea, said Vyacheslav Bizikov, the deputy director of the Russian government’s All-Russian Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography in Moscow, in an interview with Inside Climate News. Bizikov led the expedition of scientists, who lived on boats for 17 days sampling water, sediment and fish. The researchers found both diesel fuel and heavy metal contamination in the liver and muscles of fish they tested, and they warned local authorities and Indigenous communities that the fish weren’t safe to eat, he said. The findings became the basis of the lawsuit the Russian fisheries agency filed against Norilsk Nickel in July. The company and the agency are working out an agreement on how to further study the damage, restore the environment and replenish the fish, Bizikov said.  “We can restore and recover the ecosystems and water ecosystems if we do it right,” Bizikov said. “As I see it, it’s not a matter of one day or one year. If there will be no more accidents, we will manage to fix it. It’s difficult to say when, but in 10 years, maybe we will see the definite results.” New pressures for change are building on Norilsk Nickel from the outside.  Electric vehicle batteries, which rely on nickel for energy density and storage, are a major growth opportunity for the company. Russia is one of the few places that have the sulfur-rich ore that readily yields the very pure-grade Class 1 nickel needed, a resource base that has made Norilsk Nickel the world’s leading producer.   Musk of Tesla has said that he has plenty of business to offer but that he wants to partner with companies that engage in sustainable practices. “Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way,” he said on a company earnings call last year. Potanin has made clear his ambition to compete in this market, having announced that Norilsk Nickel will increase production of “green economy” metals by 30 percent to 40 percent by 2030. Norilsk Nickel, pledging to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 90 percent by 2025, has said it will spend at least $4.1 billion on a project called Sulphur Programme 2.0.  “In my opinion, the implementation of the project will fundamentally change the ecological situation in our city,” Norilsk’s current mayor, Dmitry Kasarev, who previously worked for Norilsk Nickel, said in written responses to questions from Inside Climate News. “Our city should breathe a new breath in terms of ecology.” Shvarts, who helped Norilsk Nickel develop its new environmental and climate strategy, said he supports the company’s striving to be part of the green economy. “We need to make every week, every month, a few new steps ahead to be a more transparent, more open, more environmentally responsible company,” he said. Klyushin, however, won’t wait for that day to come. He has vowed to leave Norilsk soon and not return. He worries about his friend Ryabinin, who has four children and hasn’t had a full-time job since he quit Rosprirodnadzor.  “If it were not for Vasily who started this, who discovered this, they would have avoided responsibility. This is clear,” Klyushin said. Ryabinin said that since he quit the Russian environmental protection agency, he has been working as a freelance photographer and focusing on his children. He would like to take them to a place with more opportunity — and, of course, less pollution. But for now the family has no plans to move. His wife still works for Norilsk Nickel. The experience of fighting the company changed him, Ryabinin said. The problem, he said, isn’t one company but consumption without any thought of where the raw material comes from or the need to use less. “Until the bulk of the population of our planet comes to understand the reasonable consumption of any resources,” he said, “we will not achieve either economic growth or an environmentally friendly planet. We just simply kill our children and leave them a trash heap.”  Ludmila Mekertycheva in Moscow contributed to this report. Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories."
" LONDON — Days before arriving in Glasgow, Scotland, for what was billed as a pivotal gathering on global climate initiatives, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced his country was adopting a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.  But he added that he would not legislate the goal and instead would rely on consumers and companies to drive reductions in emissions.  It was the kind of half measure that climate activists worried would carry over to the COP26 summit, the recent United Nations climate talks in Glasgow. They said it did. “Australia’s ambition for COP26 was to get away with it. To do as little as possible,” said Richie Merzian, who previously spent a decade as an Australian government COP negotiator and now works as the climate and energy program director at The Australia Institute,  an independent public policy think tank.   Fondly known as the  sunburned country due to its vast stretches of dry and barren terrain, Australia has long been under fire as one of the world’s top producers of coal and gas, and narrowly dodged being labeled the summit’s villain.  While the country remains a key U.S. ally amid tensions with China, it has done little in recent years to suggest it will be a leading partner in the fight against climate catastrophe, despite its pride in its abundant native wildlife and numerous environmental treasures. Its actions at the climate conference did little to assuage environmentalists’ concerns. Critics say Australia’s net zero announcement was a hollow promise and that the country’s attendance at the global summit only showed that the current conservative government is more wedded to fossil fuel interests than tackling climate change in any substantive way.  “They wanted to neutralize the critique that they aren’t doing anything on climate” by showing up but did little beyond that, Merzian said in a phone interview from Glasgow during the closing days of the summit.  David Ritter, CEO of Greenpeace Australia Pacific, was also scathing in his criticism of how Australia fared at the climate summit.  “The position the Morrison government took to Glasgow was an embarrassment, deeply inadequate, and wildly insufficient as the climate crisis accelerates in front of our eyes,”  he said in an email from Sydney after the summit. NBC News reached out to  Morrison’s office for comment and was referred to public comments by Angus Taylor, the minister for industry, energy and emissions reduction. “Under our Plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, we will act in a practical, responsible way to reduce emissions and build on our track record of achievement — reducing emissions while growing our economy, maintaining affordable, reliable energy and ensuring our regions remain strong. That’s the Australian way,” Taylor said in a joint statement with Marise Payne, the minister for foreign affairs, after the climate summit.  Caught between the powerful fossil fuel industry and a cascade of natural disasters, climate change has found its way to the heart of Australian politics. Mining has been a major driving force in Australia’s economy since it was a British colony in the early 1800s, but coal production truly expanded after World War II and the industry is still a major employer in many rural communities.  The country is one of the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases on a per capita basis and ranks as the world’s third largest fossil fuel exporter, behind only Russia and Saudi Arabia.  In Glasgow, Australia came under criticism for not signing onto agreements such as the so-called Global Coal to Clean Power Transition Statement promoted by the United Kingdom or the global methane Pledge led by the  United States in an effort to curb methane emissions. Coal power then became a major point of contention in the closing hours of the conference, when delegates from China and India insisted on watering down the final language of the COP26 deal and replacing a commitment to “phase out” coal with the term “phase down.”  And despite British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s assertion that Glasgow had effectively sounded “the death knell for coal power,” Morrison reiterated his country’s commitment in the wake of the summit, saying the coal industry will be working in Australia for “decades to come.”  Australia’s lack of action on the issue sets a bad example for other countries, Merzian said, “instead of driving ambition like the U.S. and the U.K.” “They are giving cover to other laggards like Russia and Turkey because they can look at Australia and say, ‘Look, if a wealthy industrialized country like Australia isn’t doing more in the short term, why should I?’” he said.  Morrison has long been caught in a political bind over climate change.  His government’s coalition partner, the National Party, is a strong supporter of the coal industry and made multiple attempts to block the  net zero target, citing potential risks to the country’s economy.  Morrison is a well-known proponent of the industry himself. He famously brought a lump of coal into the Australian Parliament  in 2017 and, with a showman’s flair, praised its value during a debate on renewable energy. “Sadly, historically, Australia’s climate policy, to some extent, has been dictated by the position of incumbent interests in the oil, gas and coal industry” and that is why it has lagged behind it’s global peers, Christian Downie, an associate professor at the Australian National University who specializes in energy and climate politics, said ahead of the conference. At the same time, the country has felt the impact of climate change and that has helped increase pressure from some voters for more decisive action. Sixty percent of respondents said “global warming is a serious and pressing problem” that should be addressed now “even if it involves significant costs,” according to a May 2021 poll by the Lowy Institute, an independent think tank in Australia. Catastrophic wildfires in 2019-20 destroyed more than 44 million acres of land, killed 34 people and resulted in the loss of nearly 3,000 homes. Nearly 3 billion koalas, kangaroos and other native Australian wildlife were killed or displaced by the wildfires, according to the World Wide Fund For Nature Australia.  And the Great Barrier Reef, the world’s most extensive coral reef ecosystem, has suffered so much from warming sea temperatures that it lost half its corals in just 20 years.  Australia reacted angrily when the United Nations threatened to downgrade the reef’s World Heritage status unless the country did more to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, narrowly avoiding the designation after heavy lobbying.  Yet, Australia ranked last out of 60 countries for its policy response to the climate crisis in one assessment released at the COP26 summit.  “The country’s lack of domestic ambition and action has made its way to the international stage,” the Climate Change Performance Index report said. “Australia has fallen behind its allies.”  A spokesperson for Taylor, the minister for energy and emissions reduction, said that the Australian government “rejects” the report’s “subjective” findings “because it clearly ignores key facts and statistics.” Environmental activists have reacted angrily to the lack of action in Glasgow.  Two young climate protesters disrupted operations at the world’s largest coal port in Newcastle, Australia, on Nov. 17 by abseiling off the huge machinery and declaring in a video livestream: “This is us responding to the climate crisis.”  To Ritter, from Greenpeace Australia, it’s past time for the country to step up on the world stage.  “Australia’s reckless climate obstruction is as brazen as it is appalling,” he said. “A betrayal of our trust and a betrayal of our future.""

" In early November, Los Angeles City Council members voted unanimously to create the city’s first chief heat officer position.  It’s an indication that in a city familiar with natural disasters, heat is emerging as a major threat. “We need to at least have planning at the level of our response to earthquakes,” said council member Paul Koretz, who helped lead efforts to create the city’s Climate Emergency Mobilization Office and supported the creation of the heat officer position.  Los Angeles becomes the third local government to have carved out a role to deal specifically with heat. Miami-Dade County in Florida and Phoenix filled similar positions this year. The jobs are designed to put the risks of heat — hidden, underestimated and intensifying with climate change — at the center as local governments prepare for a fast-warming world.  Cities can be at particular risk of heat waves as their infrastructure absorbs more heat, and it is a particular concern in rapidly urbanizing areas. “We know extreme heat days are happening more and more. We now have the occasional day where invariably somebody or multiple people will die from the heat,” Koretz said. The position is one of several initiatives to mitigate the worsening effects of climate change and to protect the city’s most vulnerable residents — often people of color and lower-income people. The heat officer will work with city departments and community organizations to increase public awareness of heat danger and set goals toward tackling the threats.  The council voted just two days before California officials announced, on the last day of the COP26 climate talks in Scotland, a new statewide ranking system for heat waves similar to what is already used for hurricanes and air quality.  “It signals people are waking up to the growing threat,” said Sara Meerow, an assistant professor in the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning at Arizona State University. In comparison to strategies to deal with flooding and other climate hazards, she said, heat planning among local governments is poorly developed.   Climate change, spurred by fossil fuel use and other polluting human activities, intensifies heat waves and makes them more frequent, according to a recent U.N. report on climate change.  Global heat exposure increased by nearly 200 percent from 1983 to 2016 because of temperature increases and population shifts toward cities, according to a recent study.  Climate scientists have said a heat wave that struck the Pacific Northwest in the summer — which sent temperatures in Portland, Oregon, up to 116 degrees Fahrenheit and killed hundreds of people — would have been virtually impossible if not for human-caused climate change. “Heat waves [are] how climate change kills us today,” Friederike Otto, a scientist at the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford, said this summer when he announced the research findings.   Although it’s the leading weather-related killer in the U.S., heat is often underestimated.  “An invisible hazard,” Meerow said. “It is deadly, but it doesn’t have the same visible destruction flooding has or a hurricane or wildfire.” Heat “is deadly, but it doesn’t have the same visible destruction flooding has or a hurricane or wildfire.” SARA MEEROW Each year from 2004 to 2018, the U.S. recorded an average of about 702 heat-related deaths, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study. That’s almost certainly an undercount of heat’s yearly impact because of how death data are compiled across the country, said Jane Gilbert, who as the heat officer for Miami-Dade County is the first person to serve in a role of its kind in the U.S. Heat can kill when people’s bodies overheat and can’t cope. It can also worsen underlying ailments, such as cardiac disease, diabetes or kidney problems. The pre-existing health complications can cloud researchers’ views. Other factors, such as acclimation, humidity and the nearby environment, also play roles.  “Heat-related illnesses and deaths are underreported because there are often complicating factors,” Gilbert said. “The data is not great, to be honest.” In Miami-Dade County, body temperature must be taken within an hour of death for a death to be recorded as heat-related, Gilbert said, leaving gaps in the county’s understanding of heat’s harms.  Among Gilbert’s priorities since she was hired in the spring has been to hire a researcher to identify where heat-related illnesses, emergency room visits and deaths aren’t being captured in the county’s numbers.   The data gap could prove to be substantial: An analysis of death records from 297 U.S. counties — covering about two-thirds of the nation’s population — estimated that 5,608 deaths were attributable to heat every year from 1997 to 2006 on average, according to a study published in the journal Environmental Epidemiology. When extreme heat threatens, it’s hard to know who is accountable.  “In most cities, it’s not entirely clear who is ultimately responsible for addressing heat risk right now,” Meerow said. Gilbert said that part of her job as heat officer is to ensure that emergency management agencies and parks and health departments, among others, work together to prepare and address heat risk holistically.  Gilbert also leads social media campaigns, community focus groups and a climate and heat health task force. The heat officer title helps draw attention to the work.  Heat deaths are almost always preventable.  “Any heat-related death is one too many,” Meerow said. “We have the technologies to provide cooling to people, and it’s about making sure everyone has access.” The burden of extreme heat is unequal. A recent investigation by the Los Angeles Times found that heat was likely to have contributed to nearly 4,000 deaths in California over the past decade, six times higher than the official state tally.  Low-income neighborhoods with little to no tree canopy, aging homes and apartments without air conditioning, and dense housing near freeways bear the brunt of extreme heat, according to researchers at the University of California, Davis.  In a report published in January, researchers found that on average the poorest 10 percent of neighborhoods in urban regions across the Southwest were 4 degrees hotter than the wealthiest 10 percent. The inequities were most stark in Southern California metro areas, including Palm Springs and the Inland Empire, where temperatures were up to 7 degrees hotter. Latino, Asian and Black residents were more likely to be negatively affected by what researchers called thermal inequities.  In Miami-Dade County, Gilbert is concerned about similar demographic patterns for heat risk. And while most people have air conditioning there, utility costs, inefficient housing and broken units leave many poorer households “air conditioning insecure,” she said.   More than 300,000 workers in the county spend the majority of their working hours outside, which could put them at greater risk.  Most hurricane shelters have backup power for lights but not for cooling, which Gilbert seeks to rectify. It’s a proven threat: After Hurricane Irma in 2017, 12 people died in a Miami nursing home where the air conditioning had broken down.

" This article was published in partnership with Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, independent news outlet that covers climate, energy and the environment. It is part of “The Fifth Crime,” a series on ecocide. FORT McMURRAY, Alberta — The land around Jean L’Hommecourt’s cabin was once miles away from the noise of the world. On long summer days, she would come with her mother to gather berries from the forest and to hunt moose when the leaves turned yellow and the air crisp. But over the last two decades, the cabin has been surrounded by the expanding mines of Alberta’s tar sands, where oil companies have dug vast open pits to extract a heavy form of crude called bitumen. L’Hommecourt and her Indigenous community of Fort McKay, about 35 miles north of Fort McMurray, have watched as the companies have replaced their traditional lands with a 40-mile string of mines, stripping away subarctic boreal forest and wetlands and rerouting waterways. “It’s an invasion of our territory, invasion of us trying to be out on the land,” L’Hommecourt said. Over the years, more and more workers have shown up in the area, stopping her along the road to tell her that she couldn’t hunt moose or that she was trespassing. “‘You’re the trespasser,’” she tells them. “‘I shouldn’t have to be answering your questions — you answer mine.’” Oil and gas companies like ExxonMobil and the Canadian giant Suncor have transformed the tar sands — also called oil sands — into one of the world’s largest industrial developments, covering an area larger than New York City. They have built sprawling waste pits that leach heavy metals into groundwater and processing plants that spew pollutants into the air, sending a sour stench for miles. The mines’ ecological impacts are so vast and so deep that L’Hommecourt and other Indigenous people here — mostly from the Dene and Cree First Nations — say the industry has challenged their very existence, even as it has provided jobs and revenue to Native businesses and communities. People in this region have long suspected that the tar sands mines were poisoning the land and everything it feeds. The economic benefits of the development are immense: Oil is Canada’s top export, and the mining and energy sector as a whole accounts for nearly a quarter of Alberta’s provincial economy. The sands pump out more than 3 million barrels of oil per day, helping make Canada the world’s fourth-largest oil producer and the top exporter of crude to the U.S. But the companies’ energy-hungry extraction has also made the oil and gas sector Canada’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, according to a government report.  The largest oil sands companies have pledged to reduce their emissions, saying they will rely largely on government-subsidized carbon capture projects. Yet oil companies and the government expect output will climb well into the 2030s. Even a new proposal by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to cap emissions in the oil sector does not include any plan to lower production. Some lawyers and advocates have pointed to the tar sands as a prime example of the widespread environmental destruction they call “ecocide.” They are pushing the International Criminal Court to outlaw ecocide as a crime, on par with genocide or war crimes. While the campaign for a new international law is likely to last years, with no assurance that it will succeed, it has drawn attention to the inability of countries’ laws to contain industrial development like the tar sands, which will pollute the land for decades or centuries. Mike Mercredi, who is Dene and lives in Fort Chipewyan, about 100 miles north of Fort McKay, noted that the name of his people translates as “people of the land.” “It’s in our name of who we call ourselves,” he said. “We are the land. So when you’re destroying that land, when you’re committing ecocide, you’re committing genocide.” Julie King, an Exxon spokeswoman, said, “ExxonMobil is committed to operating our businesses in a responsible and sustainable manner, working to minimize environmental impacts and supporting the communities where we live and work.” Leithan Slade, a spokesman for Suncor, pointed to agreements the company has signed with First Nations, adding that “Suncor sees partnering with Indigenous communities as foundational to successful energy development.” L’Hommecourt is intimately familiar with the partnerships through her work as an environmental coordinator and researcher for the Fort McKay First Nation, of which she is a member, and in that position she has fought to protect whatever shreds of land she could.  Her cabin is only 20 miles from town as the crow flies, but the drive takes more than an hour, because the road has to loop around several mines. The land, she said, is where she can think in her language, Dene, “where in the outside world it’s all English.” “You get that sense of belonging here,” she said, “and that’s what I want for our peoples, to have their land back.” She added, “If you have your land back, you have everything.” The only way to fully appreciate the scope of the tar sands is to see the mines from the air. Flying across the region from the north, the twisting channels of the Peace-Athabasca Delta dominate the landscape, snaking through forest and marshlands with not a road or a power line in sight. The terrain gives way to a mixture of forest, muskeg and drylands, where the sandy soil rises to the surface. Out of nowhere, straight lines emerge — a wide, unpaved highway and paths leading to squares carved out of the forest, where companies have explored for oil. Then the mines come into view. Billowing plumes of smoke fill the sky. Flames shoot out of flare stacks. The forest’s green is replaced by vast black holes pockmarked with giant puddles. From the air, the dump trucks and the shovels look like toys, hauling mounds of bitumen from newly dug pits. As the plane nears its descent, the cabin fills with a tarry stench. “It’s just the most completely ludicrous approach to industrial and energy development that is possible, given everything we know about the impact on ecosystems, the impact on climate,” said Dale Marshall, the national program manager for Environmental Defence, a Canadian advocacy group. To extract bitumen from the sand, oil companies heat it and then treat it in a slurry of water and solvents. In other parts of Alberta, where the sands are too deep to mine, the bitumen is melted in place and extracted through wells by pumping high-pressure steam underground. The deeper deposits cover a much larger area than the mines, more than 50,000 square miles. The extraction requires enormous amounts of energy: In 2018, the latest year for which figures are available, oil sands producers consumed 30 percent of all the natural gas burned in Canada. Collectively, the mines’ and deep-extraction projects’ greenhouse gas emissions about equal those of 21 coal-fired power plants, and that’s just to get the crude out of the ground. The operations also pump out nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, traces of which have been detected by scientists in soils and snowpack dozens of miles away. The mines guzzle vast quantities of water, with nearly 58 billion gallons drawn from the region’s rivers, lakes and aquifers in 2019, according to government figures. Much of that ends up as toxic liquid waste laced with hydrocarbons, naphthenic acids and carcinogenic heavy metals. Oil companies have been collecting the “tailings” in waste ponds, which have grown exponentially in size and now cover more than 100 square miles. Regulatory filings show that the ponds are expected to continue to expand well into the 2030s. While companies are required by law to eventually reclaim them, only a fraction have been reclaimed so far. Next to one pond, a coal-black mountain of debris towers over the water. High-voltage lines buzz overhead. Air cannons ring the pond and blast several times every minute, creating a constant explosive din. Industrial iron scarecrows are dressed with safety vests and helmets. The noise and the display are meant to scare off the millions of migratory birds that arrive in northern Alberta every year. Sometimes even those defenses fail, however, or the birds ignore them and land anyway — tens of thousands every year, according to a 2016 report to provincial regulators, obtained this year by The Narwhal, a nonprofit Canadian news organization. Ottilie Coldbeck, a spokeswoman for the Alberta Energy Regulator, which oversees the industry, said the research in the report “was not considered complete.” White explorers set their sights on the tar sands as soon as they arrived. In 1789, Sir Alexander Mackenzie reported seeing veins of “bituminous quality” exposed along the Athabasca River. Within a century, prospectors and geologists had identified “almost inexhaustible supplies” of petroleum in the area. The only obstacle seemed to be the people living above it. In 1891, the superintendent general of Indian affairs recommended drafting a treaty “with a view to the extinguishment of the Indians’ title” to open access to petroleum and other minerals. Within eight years, First Nations leaders had signed Treaty 8, in which they surrendered title of 325,000 square miles of land to the British crown while retaining the right to hunt, fish and trap freely throughout the area. The tar sands remained largely beyond reach for decades, however, until Americans, driven by nationalistic ambitions, invested vast sums of capital. When J. Howard Pew, of Sun Oil Co., opened the first commercial mine in 1967, the people of Fort McKay were not happy, said Jim Boucher, who led the First Nation as chief for three decades, until 2019. Sun Oil, now Suncor, took over an important summer hunting ground called Tar Island, he said. “There was no discussion, no consultation,” Boucher said. The fur trade had provided the nation’s members with one of their few sources of income. But it collapsed just as the oil industry was taking hold, and they had few alternatives but to turn to the oil companies’ rapidly expanding mines. “We had no choice,” Boucher said. After he became chief in 1986, Boucher formed the Fort McKay Group of Companies to work with the oil industry, and over the following decades he oversaw partnerships with energy companies that would eventually net hundreds of millions of dollars for the community. The income has allowed Fort McKay to build subsidized housing and to pay for education and elder care, achievements that Boucher rattles off proudly. Enrolled members receive quarterly dividends. Some First Nations have fought the development with lawsuits. The Beaver Lake Cree Nation, to the south, sued the federal and provincial governments in 2008, saying its treaty rights had been violated by the cumulative effects of development. Even though it got a ruling five years later allowing the case to proceed, the case is still awaiting trial, with a court date scheduled for 2024. Each of the area’s First Nations has signed “impact benefit agreements” with the oil companies that can include limits on certain practices, like water withdrawals, quotas for hiring Indigenous people and direct payments to the nations. But even as the impact agreements have secured benefits, they have deepened reliance on an industry that is consuming the land that was once the base of the Indigenous economy and culture. L’Hommecourt, who is Boucher’s cousin, said she holds no resentment toward him for tying their people’s fate to the industry. “He did what he had to do, and as a chief I commend him,” L’Hommecourt said. “They call us the richest little First Nation in Canada.” Boucher lost his grandfather’s cabin, where he learned to hunt and trap as a boy, to a mine dug by Syncrude, a consortium of oil companies. A cabin Boucher later built for his father, to the north, now sits on a postage stamp of land, he said, surrounded by newer mines. “It’s empty. That’s how the cabin is to me,” Boucher said. “So I don’t go there anymore. No joy.”  While the mines cover an expansive area, their impact on the environment reaches much farther. The town of Fort Chipewyan sits where the Peace and Athabasca rivers empty into Lake Athabasca, about 90 miles north of the closest mine, and the land here offers a glimpse of what existed before. The mostly Indigenous residents can still hunt and trap in unbroken stretches of boreal forest. But while the nights are quiet and the air smells clean, the industry’s presence is strong. Kids zoom around town on ATVs, while the supermarket displays boxes of 87-inch flat-screen TVs —  ”toys,” as some residents call them, that only those who work in the industry can afford. And despite the lake’s distance from the development, the flesh of some animals that drink from it is laced with some of the same heavy metals that collect in the waste pits. In 2010, a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found elevated levels of mercury, lead, nickel and other heavy metals in the river downstream of oil sands development, as well as in Lake Athabasca. Three years later, another study in the same journal examined lake sediments surrounding Fort McMurray and found that a group of chemicals that include cancer-causing compounds started rising in the 1960s and ʼ70s, when oil sands development began. The Athabasca Chipewyan and Mikisew Cree First Nations commissioned Stéphane McLachlan, an environmental scientist at the University of Manitoba, to test the tissues of animals, and in 2014 he released a report finding elevated levels of toxic pollutants — including arsenic, mercury and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons — in the flesh of moose, ducks and muskrats in the region. Provincial officials acknowledge that the mines’ waste ponds leak into groundwater. To “limit the risk” that the seepage will spread farther, the Alberta Energy Regulator requires companies to install drains, wells, sumps and underground walls to capture and contain the contamination, said Coldbeck, the agency spokeswoman. Federal and provincial officials have disputed research that has linked groundwater contamination to the waste pits, citing other studies that indicate that the compounds may be naturally occurring in groundwater because they are contained in bitumen. But last year, the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, an environmental body created alongside the North American Free Trade Agreement, assessed all the published studies of water contamination and concluded that there was “scientifically valid evidence” that the waste pits were leaching contaminants into groundwater. The analysis noted that some research has concluded that the contamination reached the Athabasca River but that scientists were still debating the findings. Asked about the report, Coldbeck said her agency “does not have any evidence” that contaminated groundwater has reached the Athabasca River. In response to a question about health concerns, she said the agency “is committed to ensuring that Alberta’s oil sands are developed in a safe and responsible manner” and referred questions to Alberta Health, the province’s public health agency. A spokesperson for Alberta Health did not reply to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers declined to comment, pointing instead to reports the group has issued about engagement with Indigenous communities and about greenhouse gas emissions. Meanwhile, published surveys of cancer cases in Fort Chipewyan carried out in 2009 and 2014 came up with mixed results. Both showed higher-than-normal rates of certain cancers, including biliary tract cancers. One study determined that overall cancer rates were elevated. The other did not. Alice Rigney, an elder with the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation, blames the oil development for her nephew’s death from bile duct cancer, even as she acknowledges that there is nothing to prove the connection. “They took it all away,” she said of the oil companies, speaking not just about her nephew but also about the broader environmental impacts. “What else is there to take?” The global oil industry is increasingly under assault, and Canada’s tar sands, because of the developments’ high greenhouse gas emissions, are a prime target of climate activists. Because new tar sands projects require billions of dollars of investment up front, many financial analysts say the era of opening new mines is over. But even if production from the mines holds steady or declines gradually, their massive footprints are likely to expand for decades, because companies must continue to clear land to keep up production. And whenever the mines do decline, the industry will face the challenge of what to do with the waste it has produced. The provincial government has secured $730 million from companies as collateral for a cleanup, but that will not even begin to cover the costs. While regulators’ official estimate of the liability for Alberta’s mining industry is $27 billion, an internal report obtained in 2018 by Canadian journalists estimated cleanup costs of more than $100 billion.  L’Hommecourt said she is torn about whether she will remain here. “My heart is in the boreal forest,” she said. But her kids want to move away, and if they do, she might, too. The mines are coming closer to the cabin, and more roads are being blocked off. Regulatory filings show that Imperial Oil plans eventually to reroute the creek that runs past her cabin to make way for its Kearl mine. If it does so, the land where the cabin sits would be buried by land cleared from elsewhere within the mine. A spokeswoman for Imperial, Exxon’s Canadian affiliate, declined to comment specifically on the filings but said the company “has collaborative and unique relationship agreements with these local communities that provide mutual benefits.” The cabin itself has been a symbol of L’Hommecourt’s resistance. It sits on an old trappers’ trail that Imperial’s workers began using about 10 years ago as an unpaved access road for exploration, marking it off with a “No Trespassing” sign. L’Hommecourt built her cabin in the middle of that road. “I just said, ‘I don’t care,’” L’Hommecourt said. “I’m going to put my house right here, and this is where it’s going to be.” When company workers come by, she said, “I just tell them, ‘Turn around and go back, and if you have a problem with it, get your VP or whoever it is that you report to and then tell them to come and see me.’” So far, no one has shown up.

" A South Pacific island nation at risk from rising sea levels has expressed disappointment with the international climate pact struck last week after it was watered down at the last minute. Tuvalu Foreign Minister Simon Kofe on Monday said the deal signed over the weekend should have pledged to the “phasing out” instead of the “phasing down” of carbon emissions. The agreement’s wording was changed just before the conclusion of the United Nations’ COP26 climate summit after interventions by India and China, two of the world’s largest producers of greenhouse gases. “We were disappointed with the last minute change to the language around coal from ‘phasing out’ to ‘phasing down.’ I think we were quite disappointed, as well as other Pacific island countries, with that last minute change,” he told Reuters following the pact that was sealed Saturday.  Tuvalu, a nation of 12,000 people and nine small low-lying islands, may soon become uninhabitable as sea levels rise 0.2 inches a year, a rate higher than the global average. Its highest point stands at 15 feet, meaning any rise in sea levels will wash away parts of the islands and make surrounding areas unfit for living. Other island nations in the Pacific Ocean face the same existential threat.  The outcome of the summit, which concluded two weeks of negotiations and saw almost 200 countries sign an agreement on how to battle climate change, has been criticized by activists and politicians as being insufficient to avert an impending climate-led catastrophe.  The summit’s president, United Kingdom lawmaker Alok Sharma, has told the BBC both India and China will have to “explain themselves” to countries most vulnerable to the effects of rising temperatures after the last minute wording change.  Meanwhile, in his closing remarks at the climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres commended delegates from around the world on reaching a deal but acknowledged that there is more work to be done. “Our fragile planet is hanging by a thread,” he said in a video address. “We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe.” The deal includes several key pledges, including an agreement to reduce coal power and fossil fuel subsidies. However, critics say, the commitments are not aggressive enough to avert the worst impacts of climate change and that they do not provide enough support to developing nations disproportionately affected by global warming. Kofe added that stronger action against climate action was crucial to the survival of Tuvalu and other small island nations, saying larger countries, such as neighboring Australia, should have vowed to take more substantial cuts to their carbon emissions.  “It really comes down to countries — the big emitters — that need to act on this. But we will continue to push on, we will continue to advocate to, you know, reduce emissions moving forward,” the minister continued. “What is important now is the implementation plan and moving forward. Making pledges is one thing, but it’s something else to actually see countries act on those,” Kofe said.  Kofe had urged world leaders to take action against climate change during a speech to the summit Nov. 9. He delivered his appeal submerged up to his knees in water in an area in Tuvalu where there once was dry land. “We cannot wait for speeches when the sea is rising around us all the time … We must take bold alternative action today to secure tomorrow,” he said in his address.  Footage of his speech went viral on social media, drawing international attention to the island nation’s plight. Studies show global carbon emissions must be slashed by 45 percent by 2030 to avoid a temperature rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius, the threshold scientists say is necessary to avoid the most devastating results of climate change.

" After 15 days of tense negotiations, an agreement was reached Saturday by nearly 200 countries at the United Nations Climate Change Conference on how to address the growing crisis of global warming. Though the deal includes several key pledges, including an agreement to reduce coal power and fossil fuel subsidies, many critics say the commitments do not provide enough support to developing nations that are disproportionately affected by global warming and are not aggressive enough to avert the worst impacts of climate change. In his closing remarks at the climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres commended delegates from around the world on reaching a deal but acknowledged that there is more work to be done. ""Our fragile planet is hanging by a thread,"" he said in a video address. ""We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe."" Guterres added that the agreement from this year's summit, known as the 26th ""Conference of the Parties,"" or COP26, was a ""compromise,"" and that ""deep contradictions"" remain. And while progress was made — including a landmark deal between more than 100 world leaders to end deforestation by 2030 and a surprise agreement between the U.S. and China to accelerate emissions reductions this decade — he said the nations most vulnerable to the effects of global warming need more support. ""These are welcome steps, but they are not enough,"" Guterres said. The frantic final hours of the conference included a significant compromise on the language around coal power. Early drafts of the COP26 deal called for countries to ""phase out"" coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel and biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, and fossil fuel subsidies, but India led campaigns to water down the wording, replacing it instead with ""phase down."" Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan called the changed language ""weak and compromised,"" but added that, ""its very existence is nevertheless a breakthrough."" The burning of fossil fuels, which unleashes carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases, is the primary contributor to climate change, but the COP26 deal marks the first time the words ""fossil fuels"" have been written into a global climate pact. Eighteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg dismissed the outcome of the global summit but vowed to keep pushing for action. ""The #COP26 is over. Here’s a brief summary: Blah, blah, blah,"" she tweeted Saturday. ""But the real work continues outside these halls. And we will never give up, ever."" The COP26 summit was seen as crucial to keeping alive the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius, which scientists have said is necessary to avert the most devastating impacts of climate change. The planet has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius, compared to preindustrial times, and studies have shown that staying below the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold will require reducing global emissions by 45 percent by 2030. Though one of the goals of this year's climate summit was for countries to set forth aggressive new targets for reducing emissions, a recent analysis by the U.N. Environment Programme warned that existing national pledges still put the world on track for more than 2 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century. Diplomats at COP26 agreed that all countries need to do more to accelerate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and the deal calls on governments to return next year to strengthen their 2030 targets. Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of World Resources Institute, a Washington-based research nonprofit organization, said the plan to revisit and intensify pledges more regularly will help keep the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal within reach. ""While we are not yet on track, the progress made over the last year and at the COP26 summit offers a strong foundation to build upon,"" he said in a statement. ""The real test now is whether countries accelerate their efforts and translate their commitments into action."" The climate summit was supposed to end Friday but ran into overtime after disputes emerged over portions of the deal, including a framework for global carbon markets that would allow high-polluting nations or entities to trade or buy credits to offset emissions. Disagreements over a provision known as ""loss and damage,"" which centers around how to provide financial support to poor countries that contribute only a tiny fraction of global emissions but are suffering some of the worst effects of climate change, also threatened to derail negotiations. Financing was one of the most contentious topics throughout the summit, and representatives from several developing nations and humanitarian organizations expressed dissatisfaction with the outcome of such talks. Aminath Shauna, minister for environment, climate change and technology for the Maldives, said that progress was made at this year's summit, but added that, ""this progress is not in line with the urgency and scale with the problem at hand."" ""The difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees is a death sentence for us,"" Shauna said Saturday. Still, COP26 president Alok Sharma said this year's proceedings mark an important stepping stone. ""We can now say with credibility that we have kept 1.5 degrees alive,"" Sharma said. ""But its pulse is weak and it will only survive if we keep our promises and translate commitments into rapid action."" Next year's summit, COP27, is scheduled to convene in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt.

" STONY RAPIDS, Saskatchewan — Kurt House is in a hurry. He’s looking for the key minerals — cobalt, copper and nickel — that go into the batteries that can power clean energy technologies, particularly the incoming demand from electric vehicles. That is why in August he watched as a helicopter flew past with a massive metal detector swinging beneath it, scanning a vast section of this remote Canadian wilderness. The device, akin to a giant dream catcher at 115 feet across and weighing 1,700 pounds, peered a third of a mile into the earth by using an electromagnetic current. The data it collects is key to trying to speed up what has traditionally been the slow, painstaking process of mineral discovery. “The problem we’re trying to solve is global climate change, and to do it we have to electrify everything,” said House, CEO of KoBold Metals, the company he co-founded to hunt for the crucial minerals. “The problem is we don’t have enough metal to build all those electric vehicles, so we need to find a lot more.” KoBold is one of many companies founded in recent years to address the various bottlenecks in the broader push toward renewable energy. And the mineral bottleneck is a particularly narrow one. To meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement, House estimated the world needs $10 trillion dollars in new discoveries of the four key metals — cobalt, copper, nickel and lithium — that go into the batteries of electric vehicles. Others believe there are enough discovered sources, but the deposits are not located in places hospitable to mining operations. Elsewhere, productive mines are met with human rights concerns. For instance, about 70 percent of the world’s cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where children sometimes toil in mines.  Because of that, other companies are focused on refining how the metals are mined, particularly in places where current methods are hard on the environment. In northern Chile, Wealth Minerals, which is based in Vancouver, British Columbia, owns rights to a lithium mining claim right between two established, productive lithium mines. The traditional method of extraction is to remove brine containing lithium and let the water evaporate out to then separate the usable metal.  It’s a practice that has drawn the ire of environmentalists. “That’s become a little bit of a swear word,” said Henk van Alphen, CEO of Wealth Minerals. “You don’t really evaporate water in one of the driest regions in the world.” In spite of the other two active mines, the Chilean government is requiring the company to find another workable method of extraction, which Wealth and its partners believe they have figured out. Van Alphen said there is similar pressure from the supply chain for operations to be as Earth-friendly as possible. “Car companies are very, very worried about how the battery commodities are being produced around the world,” Van Alphen said. “They want to make sure it’s socially and environmentally responsible.” House believes they can avoid some of those challenges by exploring only in areas that approve of mining from the start, applying KoBold’s proprietary technology to speed up the discovery process.  After each day’s helicopter flights, his company sends the data it collects to its team in Berkeley, California. Data scientists use machine learning to run what’s collected each day past thousands of historical data points sourced from mining discoveries all around the world — some of them hundreds of years old. While KoBold employs its own geologists, they’ve learned in a short time that even the best human forecasts for where a mineable deposit might be are frequently off. The combination of teams in the air, on the ground and in Berkeley, they believe, are key to making it work. The group has some considerable backing. Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos have invested in the company, and BHP Group, one of the world’s largest mining companies, signed a deal with KoBold to explore for battery metals in Australia and elsewhere around the world. The deal will keep KoBold busy: It covers an exploration area of nearly 200,000 square miles. M. Stephen Enders, a professor who heads the mining engineering department at the Colorado School of Mines and spent four decades in the exploration business, said speed matters.  “The faster you can target, the faster you can fail, and ultimately the more likely you’re going to be successful,” Enders, who is not affiliated with KoBold, said. While battery technology has improved, demand for minerals is expected to grow quickly.  In January, General Motors rocked the auto industry when it announced the company would sell only zero-emission passenger vehicles by 2035. On its way to electrification, GM has reduced its cobalt use by 70 percent along with other companies that have faced headwinds about the most common source of the mineral. “We’re gonna need a lot more lithium,” said Tim Grewe, GM’s director of electrification strategy.  GM has already innovated its way to smaller batteries that go much farther. The GMC Hummer EV Pickup, which can travel more than 300 miles on a single charge, will be released later this year. Between 2016 and today, the company has reduced its battery costs by 40 percent but acknowledged that to make its entire range of vehicles both electric and affordable, it will have to do better. “To make EVs more affordable, we have to work on the total system,” Grewe said. “How do we get the lowest cost elements out of the ground, use them in the vehicle, and how do we have secondary use in recycling to have it all come back?” GM, of course, is not the only one innovating. Sila, a company based in Alameda, California, has developed a battery that uses silicon in its anode, which made it lighter and more powerful. So far the technology has been deployed in a fitness wearable, but the company told NBC News it hopes the technology will enter the EV market in 2025. And innovation could come as a threat to House’s KoBold. As Enders at the Colorado School of Mines pointed out, the average time to develop and build a mine after discovery sits around 17 years. “It’s a bet on the technology being in play when they’re ready to get value out of their discoveries,” Enders said. “Who would have thought a few years ago that lead acid batteries would be replaced by lithium-ion batteries?” House said he’s still willing to bet on minerals.  “The fossil fuel economy is a one-way trip,” he said. “When we mine new metal for an electric vehicle, we can recycle it 20, 30 times. And eventually we won’t need to mine at all.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories. Anne Thompson is NBC News’ chief environmental affairs correspondent.

" GLASGOW, Scotland — Negotiators at this year’s U.N. climate talks in Glasgow appeared to be backing away from a call to end all use of coal and phase out fossil fuel subsidies completely, but gave poor countries hope for more financial support to cope with global warming. The latest draft proposals from the meeting’s chair released Friday call on countries to accelerate “the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels.” A previous proposal Wednesday had been stronger, calling on countries to “accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuel.” The changes, if agreed, could give countries loopholes to continue burning coal and subsidize fossil fuels. While the chair’s proposal is likely to undergo further negotiation at the talks, due to end Friday, the change in wording suggested a shift away from unconditional demands that some fossil fuel exporting nations have objected to. The question of how to address the continued use of fossil fuels responsible for much of global warming has been one of the key sticking points at the two-week talks. Scientists agree it is necessary to end their use as soon as possible to meet the 2015 Paris accord’s ambitious goal of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit). But explicitly including such a call in the overarching declaration is politically sensitive, including for countries, such as Saudi Arabia, that fear oil and gas may be targeted next. Another crunch issue is the question of financial aid for poor countries to cope with climate change. Rich nations failed to provide them with $100 billion annually by 2020, as agreed, causing considerable anger among developing countries going into the talks. The latest draft reflects those concerns, expressing “deep regret” that the $100 billion goal hasn’t been met and urging rich countries to scale up their funding. It also adds wording that could create a fund to compensate countries for serious destruction resulting from climate change. Rich nations such as the United States, who have historically been the biggest source of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, are opposed to any legal obligation to pay for loss and damage suffered by poor countries. Negotiators from almost 200 nations gathered in Glasgow on Oct. 31 amid dire warnings from leaders, activists and scientists that not enough is being done to curb global warming. According to the proposed decision, countries plan to express “alarm and utmost concern” that human activities have already caused around 1.1C (2F) of global warming “and that impacts are already being felt in every region.” While the Paris accord calls for limiting temperature to “well below” 2C (3.6F), ideally no more than 1.5C, by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial times, the draft agreement notes that the lower threshold “would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change” and resolves to aim for that target. In doing so, it calls for the world to cut carbon dioxide emission by 45% in 2030 compared with 2010 levels, and to add no additional CO2 to the atmosphere by mid-century. So far the world is not on track for that, and developed countries are expected to be asked to submit more ambitious targets for cutting emissions next year. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told The Associated Press this week that the 1.5C-goal “is still in reach but on life support.” If negotiators are unable to reach agreement by Friday’s official deadline, it is likely the talks will go into overtime. This has happened at many of the previous 25 meetings as consensus from all 197 countries is required to pass decisions. Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories."
" With just one day to go in a global summit that has been called the ""the world’s last best chance"" to avert the climate crisis, United Nations officials didn't mince words about just how much work remains as the meeting heads into its final frenzied hours. Speaking Thursday at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said countries have significant ground to cover in negotiating a global plan to tackle the climate emergency. ""Governments need to pick up the pace and show the necessary ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance in a balanced way,"" he said. ""We cannot settle for the lowest common denominator. We know what must be done."" Guterres said progress has been made at this year's summit, known as the 26th ""conference of parties,"" or COP26, but that efforts to slash global emissions and phase out fossil fuels have not gone far enough. ""Promises ring hollow when the fossil fuel industry still receives trillions in subsidies as measured by the [International Monetary Fund],"" he said. ""Or when countries are still building coal plants. Or when carbon is still without a price, distorting markets and investor decisions."" Alok Sharma, president of COP26, had even stronger words Thursday for the meeting's delegates, who are racing to finalize agreements overnight and into the conference's waning hours. ""Time is running out,"" he said, adding that there is ""still a lot more work to be done."" The COP26 summit is seen as crucial to keeping alive the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius, which scientists have said is necessary to avert the most devastating impacts of climate change. Studies have shown that staying below the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold will require reducing global emissions by 45 percent by 2030. But a recent analysis by the U.N. Environment Programme warned that existing national climate pledges still put the world on track for 2.7 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century. A COP26 draft agreement was released Wednesday that outlined the need for countries to phase out coal and fossil fuel subsidies and called on rich countries to ""urgently scale up their provision of climate finance"" to help developing nations that are disproportionately affected by climate change. The draft, which was updated Thursday, also urged countries to revisit and strengthen their pledges to reduce emissions next year. Representatives from nearly 200 countries are now in the process of preparing a final agreement, which traditionally requires sign-off from all parties. Though COP26 is scheduled to wrap up Friday, it's not uncommon for proceedings to run long. Though both Guterres and Sharma are pressuring governments to pick up the pace, Sharma said Thursday that a number of issues remain unresolved, including finance for developing nations and discussions around carbon markets. ""We are not there yet on the most critical issues,"" Sharma said. ""We still have a monumental challenge ahead of us."" Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories.

" World leaders have committed to limiting Earth’s rising temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. But what does that feel like? It’s difficult to convey, because you may not notice changes in average temperature. But, depending on where you live, you might notice when it’s extremely hot. To better understand the issue, Columbia University’s climate school recently published a global dataset with estimates of both population and temperature. The Associated Press analyzed the data — spanning 1983 to 2016 — and found that exposure to extreme heat has tripled and now affects about a quarter of the world’s population. As the global average temperature rises, so do the hottest daily temperatures. And, in some places, the hottest days can be dangerous to human health, causing heat stress. Heat stress can create a host of health problems, including rashes, cramps and heat stroke. Hot air is not the only risk factor for it. Other factors include humidity, wind speed and the amount of shade. You may be familiar with the heat index, which takes into consideration temperature and humidity to suggest what it feels like in the shade on a hot day. But even the heat index doesn’t tell you what it’s like to be working in the full sun on an extremely hot windless day. Increasingly, climate scientists and meteorologists are advocating for the use of a different metric for understanding extreme heat. It’s called wet-bulb globe temperature and it takes into account temperature, humidity, wind speed, sun angle and cloud cover. The new dataset uses estimates of both population and wet-bulb globe temperature to better understand how many people are affected by dangerously hot temperatures and where they live. When the wet-bulb globe temperature exceeds 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), people are advised to start taking rests if they’re working outdoors. To match heat measures with population estimates, the researchers averaged temperature data over 13,115 urban centers identified in a dataset produced by the European Union. Out of those urban centers around the world, nearly half experienced an increasing trend in heat exposure. In 2016, just under 1.7 billion people lived in those areas, with the majority in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The most affected region, by far, was southern Asia, where India alone accounted for 37 percent of the population living in areas with an increasing extreme heat trend. With population growth from 1983 to 2016 for each city and estimates for the year-to-year increase in annual counts of dangerously hot days, the AP was able to identify the cities in the world where exposure to extreme heat is increasing most. In Dhaka, Bangladesh, the population more than tripled from about 7.7 million in 1983 to 24 million in 2016. While the city grew by more than 16 million people, the number of extreme heat days also increased by 1.5 days a year, until Dhaka experienced about 50 more dangerously hot days a year than it did in 1983. This large population growth, along with the warming trend for the area, reveals that Dhaka had the biggest increase in heat exposure in the world. Population growth and increasing temperature both contribute to exposure trends. In some cases, these have an equal effect. That was the case in Kolkata, India, where the population grew by 6 million people and the number of hot days grew by 1.76 each year. Both of these increases contributed to a steep exposure trend. Meanwhile, New Delhi added nearly 14 million people. While the city added 1.12 additional hot days each year, the population increase is what made Delhi’s exposure trend the steepest in India. This dataset focuses on the past, but could help world leaders make more informed decisions in the future. Indonesia is planning to move the country’s capital from Jakarta — a city that is sinking below sea level — to Kalimantan. The development site is in an area of jungle between two cities, Samarinda and Balikpapan. Both cities have increasing heat exposure trends. People in Balikpapan, located at the mouth of the Bakpapan Bay, could expect 10 more days of extreme heat in 2016 compared with 1983. Samarinda, situated on the humid Mahakam River delta, could expect 19 more days. Jakarta, although sinking, did not register a significant increasing exposure trend in the dataset. Many cities that already experience extreme heat are growing rapidly. Douala, Cameroon, grew from roughly 760,000 people in 1983 to nearly 3 million in 2016. United Nations population projections suggest that count will double by 2035. Douala’s citizens endured 76 days of extreme heat in 2016. Douala is representative of sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. According to the 2019 U.N. World Population Prospects, most of the world’s population growth will come from this region in the coming years, and it’s growing rapidly at a time when warming trends are increasing in cities across the area. Whether world leaders are able to limit the rise in the global average temperature, people in this part of the world will likely feel the difference in the resulting heat exposure most. Dim Coumou, a climate professor at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, said the combination of growth in African cities and climate change presents a serious risk. “As the population increases in these megacities, you have more buildings, more concrete and an increased heat-island effect, making the heat waves worse,” Coumou said. “I think it’s a dangerous combination.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories."
" Nearly half of all California residents are under a regional drought emergency as record dry conditions continue to exacerbate a statewide crisis. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, a wholesaler to 26 local agencies that together supply some 19 million people with water, declared a state of emergency Tuesday in a resolution that calls for increased conservation efforts. Last month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom expanded a statewide drought emergency, which authorizes the state water board to ban wasteful water uses, such as using potable water for washing sidewalks and driveways.  Tuesday's declaration, which also pertains to businesses, supports Newsom's proclamation, activates additional conservation efforts and expands water efficiency programs. “We need immediate action to preserve and stretch our limited State Water Project supplies,” board Chairwoman Gloria D. Gray said in a statement. “Southern California on average gets about one-third of its water from Northern California via the state project. Next year, we’ll be lucky to get a small fraction of that.” The declarations come as California struggles with unprecedented dry conditions and an ongoing strain on state water resources. California's last two water years were the driest two-year period on record for precipitation. In August, Lake Oroville — the main reservoir in the State Water Project — reached its lowest point since the 1970s. In July, Newsom called on residents across the state to cut their water use by 15 percent, but state figures showed residents had reduced use by about 5 percent by August. The California Department of Water Resources indicated its initial State Water Project allocation next month will be zero, the water district said. If drought conditions continue, the state could provide only enough water ""as deemed necessary to protect the health and safety of Californians,"" according to the water district. This could include reducing water deliveries that would ultimately prevent outdoor watering. “We’re reaching uncharted territory here and we need all Southern Californians to be part of the solution,” Metropolitan General Manager Adel Hagekhalil said in a statement. “We need everyone to take action to reduce their water use immediately. This drought emergency declaration helps us all move in the same direction.” Conditions have become so dry in California that even an October deluge in northern parts of the state could not alleviate drought. During normal years, the winter snowpack in the Sierra Nevada supplies about 30 percent of water statewide when the spring melt comes and water runs off to be captured in the state’s system of reservoirs. On April 1, the date when the snowpack is typically at its deepest and contains the greatest amount of water, the state Department of Water Resources’ system of electronic monitors found it was only 59 percent of average. Then, in a stunning development, about 80 percent of the predicted runoff never appeared. Soils were so dry and temperatures so warm that the water instead was soaked up or evaporated, and reservoir water storage fell to shocking levels.

" Tangier Island, home to a Virginia fishing town and about 400 people, could be saturated by rising seas and convert to uninhabitable wetlands by 2051, according to an analysis released Monday.  The tiny island, which drew national attention for its residents’ support of former President Donald Trump and skepticism of climate change, is one of many Chesapeake Bay islands sinking because of local sea level rise and subsidence. People have lived on the island since the 18th century, but the residents could soon face displacement.  The new study, published Monday in the peer-reviewed journal Frontiers in Climate, estimates that it would cost about $150 million to relocate the town of Tangier’s residents and as much as $350 million to bulk up the island and protect its shoreline.  The quick timeline and steep costs for relocating a single small town illustrate the challenges the United States faces as sea levels rise and flooding increasingly threatens coastal communities. Millions of Americans could be forced to move from flood-prone areas by the year 2100, according to the 2018 U.S. national climate assessment. No federal agency has the authority to lead national assistance on climate migration efforts, a 2020 Government Accountability Office report said.  “What people are going to start realizing quickly, dealing with climate change is going to be an extremely expensive undertaking,” said Dave Schulte, a scientist for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and one of the paper’s two authors. “A lot of towns and cities are going to have similar estimates, and I have no idea where we’re going to get that money.” Tangier is the kind of place where churches are at the core of the community, kids cruise the streets on bicycles, parents don’t worry about them and the sunset reminds you why you love home, said James “Ooker” Eskridge, a waterman who serves as the “close-knit” community’s mayor.  Tangier is mostly white and working class, and its economy since the 1880s has centered on fishing, crabbing and oystering, said Jonna Yarrington, an anthropologist at the University of Virginia who lived on the island for about a year, wrote a dissertation about Tangier and is working on a book about it. In recent decades, job opportunities have declined and the population has dwindled, Yarrington said.  Today, the island is a haven for blue crab, Conservative political views and journalists, drawn in recent years to the tale of a “Trump-loving” island of “climate skeptics” whose home faces an existential threat.  It’s an image embraced by Eskridge, who welcomes reporters in hopes media attention might help save the island.  Eskridge said he’s personally not convinced humans are the cause of climate change, and he’s unsure what can — or should — be done about it.  “I think we need to adjust to it, but as far as stopping it, I’m not sold,” he said. In his view, it’s erosion that is bedeviling the island. (Sea level rise can exacerbate coastal erosion. The study found that sea level rise is driving the sinking of Tangier and that stopping coastal erosion alone wouldn’t save the town.)  While many Tangier residents might not agree that climate change is the culprit, they’ve watched their island shrink for decades. Last spring, when Zehao Wu, now 18, brought his computer into the family living room to show off the results of the project he’d been fiddling with for weeks, his dad “jumped out of his chair.”  For years, Schulte, Wu’s father, had been talking about Tangier Island around the dinner table, often venting frustration at how little action had been taken to help communities like it.  Schulte, a marine scientist based in Norfolk, Virginia, had published a paper in 2015 in Scientific Reports predicting Tangier might soon need to be abandoned. The 2015 study said the land mass was on pace to be lost in the next 50 years.  The paper stirred media interest but no commitment from policymakers to save the town. And Schulte felt that people misunderstood the cause of Tangier’s problems — that accelerating sea level rise is to blame.  In 2017, after CNN aired a segment that noted Tangier Island’s support of Trump, the president himself phoned Eskridge to tell him not to worry about sea level rise and that the town would last for hundreds more years. Wu’s computer screen last spring said otherwise.  Data analysis of satellite mapping showed that Tangier Island had lost nearly 62 percent of its upland area since 1967.  “I was really astounded at the change. It was much larger than I thought I knew at that time,” Schulte said.  Over the next months, on weekends and after high school classes, Wu pulled up a bean bag chair beside his father’s desk, and the pair worked side-by-side to finish their paper explaining the pace at which data suggests seawater will saturate the island.  “My science teacher is really pumped,” said Wu, who worries that poor and disadvantaged communities will be left behind as the nation adapts to climate change.  The study paints a disquieting picture for Tangier Island. More than two-thirds of the island’s land mass is gone. Most individual properties now contain wetland areas. Two of the islands’ ridges are expected to become wetland in the 2030s, with the third expected to succumb by 2051, the paper states.  The rate of relative sea level rise has accelerated. A model of Tangier’s population decline, which predicts a total exodus by 2053, shows that it trends similarly to the decline in habitable land.  “You can’t live in a swamp,” Wu said.  Even if coastal erosion were stopped, the town would still need to be abandoned because of sea level rise, the study says.  For Tangier Island, “all the data are pointing to the same conclusion. This is a very well done study,” said Tal Ezer, a professor of Ocean & Earth sciences at Old Dominion University who was not involved in the Tangier paper. “This island has been in the news and it’s the most at risk, but there are some other communities near the coast along the Chesapeake Bay and mid-Atlantic that are also at risk.”  Scientists view the greater Chesapeake Bay area as a hotspot for local sea level rise. The southern part of the bay has been sinking for centuries. Ice Age glaciers once laid across land to the north, pressing down on that area and causing Chesapeake Bay land to rise higher. Now, it’s settling, Ezer said. Ocean circulation patterns might also be contributing to make local sea level rise more significant than the global average.  In the days before the study was published, a nor’easter and high tides battered Tangier Island, Eskridge said. It flooded at least 10 of the island’s 210 homes. Platforms for crab pots collapsed and crab shanties were damaged.  “Even guys in their 80s hadn’t seen the water so high before,” Eskridge said. “This time, homes got water that never had to worry about it before.” Eskridge and Schulte might not agree on what is causing Tangier’s demise, but they share a similar hope for its future. The island needs help soon, they say.  The local fishing community is mostly self reliant, “but this erosion issue is too large to deal with,” Eskridge said. “We do need help from the government to do it.”  Schulte estimates that it would take $250 million to 350 million to protect the island’s shoreline with stone and oyster reefs, raise the landscape with dredged sand and then retrofit much of the town’s infrastructure. (Eskridge thinks the island could be built up and protected for a fraction of that cost.) “If America decides to save things in the order of what’s economically productive, all these small towns like Tangier are going to get abandoned,” Schulte said. “I think it’s worth the effort to save the town.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories.

" The U.S. and China pledged Wednesday to work closely together on climate change this decade in a rare and unexpected joint statement that brought fresh energy to the final days of the U.N. climate summit in Scotland. The world's two biggest economies declared their intention ""to work individually, jointly, and with other countries during this decisive decade, in accordance with different national circumstances, to strengthen and accelerate climate action and cooperation,"" the statement read. The U.S. climate envoy, John Kerry, and his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, brokered the agreement, which they touted in separate news conferences. Kerry said on Twitter that the deal is ""a step in the right direction, a mark of progress and a solid foundation for continued cooperation in climate between our two countries."" The countries said they will work together on deforestation and hold a bilateral meeting next year about methane, a potent greenhouse gas far more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. The joint statement, which was otherwise light on details, mostly affirmed earlier goals, such as ending overseas coal financing and preserving the 2015 Paris agreement's target of limiting global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius. But the pledge nonetheless gave a jolt of momentum to the summit by showing that the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases — China — was still involved. It is China's biggest move so far at the conference, where Beijing officials have not had a major presence and President Xi Jinping did not show up. China was facing major political blowback for largely shrugging off the COP26 summit in Scotland, which scientists have called the last, best chance to avert the worst of global warming. President Joe Biden, in his closing news conference during a two-day stop at the summit, said Xi's decision to skip the conference was ""a big mistake."" ""The fact that China is trying to assert, understandably, a new role in the world as a world leader, not showing up? Come on,"" Biden said. Kerry said in a recent interview in Glasgow that it would have been better for Xi to have attended the summit, but he said he had been having productive conversations with lower-level Chinese officials. ""The door is not shut at this point in time,"" Kerry said of cooperation with China. ""And I really think what's critical is to be summoning everybody's willpower to step further, to do more than they thought was possible."" The absence of several top-level officials from the world's largest polluter had cast a shadow of pessimism over the conference in Glasgow. Wednesday's pledge with the U.S. — the second-largest polluter — appeared aimed at reassuring other participants that the two countries, whose actions will determine the success or failure of climate efforts, were more aligned than not. Still, China did not sign the global methane pledge the U.S. and the EU brokered in Glasgow to reduce emissions of the potent greenhouse gas by 30 percent by the end of the decade. China also disappointed climate hawks by declining to increase its target to reduce emissions. Beijing aims to be carbon neutral by 2060 — a decade after the U.S. goal. Environmental groups in the U.S. praised the joint declaration while cautioning that the real test will be whether written commitments translate into action. John Podesta, the chair of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said in a statement, ""Our future looks brighter today."" Manish Bapna, the president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the joint declaration was ""good news."" ""The pledge to strengthen cooperation on clean energy, methane, and deforestation from the two largest economies and greenhouse gas emitters is a welcome step forward,"" Bapna said in a statement. ""But if we are to hold global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, we urgently need to see commitments to cooperate translate into bolder climate targets and credible delivery.""

" DENVER — Around the U.S., cities are increasingly warming to an idea that once induced gags: Sterilize wastewater from toilets, sinks and factories, and eventually pipe it back into homes and businesses as tap water. In the Los Angeles area, plans to recycle wastewater for drinking are moving along with little fanfare just two decades after similar efforts in the city sparked such a backlash they had to be abandoned. The practice, which must meet federal drinking water standards, has been adopted in several places around the country, including nearby Orange County. “We’ve had a sea change in terms of public attitudes toward wastewater recycling,” said David Nahai, the former general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. The shifting attitudes around a concept once dismissively dubbed “toilet to tap” come as dry regions scramble for ways to increase water supplies as their populations boom and climate change intensifies droughts. Other strategies gaining traction include collecting runoff from streams and roads after storms, and stripping seawater of salt and other minerals, a process that’s still relatively rare and expensive. Though there are still only about two dozen communities in the U.S. using some form of recycled water for drinking, that number is projected to more than double in the next 15 years, according to WateReuse, a group that helps cities adopt such conservation practices. In most places that do it, the sterilized water is usually mixed back into a lake, river or other natural source before being reused — a step that helps make the idea of drinking treated sewage go down easier for some. Funding for more wastewater recycling projects is on the way. The bipartisan infrastructure bill passed by Congress has $1 billion for water reuse projects in the West, including the $3.4 billion project in Southern California. And tucked into the federal budget reconciliation package being debated is $125 million in grants for alternative water sources nationwide that could include reuse technologies. The Southern California project would be the nation’s largest wastewater recycling program, producing enough water to supply 500,000 homes, according to the Metropolitan Water District, which serves 19 million people in Los Angeles and surrounding counties. In Colorado, over two dozen facilities already recycle water for non-drinking purposes, which is more affordable than cleaning it for drinking. But growing populations mean cities could need to pull additional supply from the Colorado River, which is already strained from overuse. At that point, it might make sense to start recycling for drinking purposes as well, said Greg Fisher, head of demand planning for Denver Water. To warm residents to the idea, Colorado Springs Utilities is hosting a mobile exhibit that shows how wastewater recycling works. On a cold, rainy afternoon, dozens of visitors showed up to learn about the carbon-based purification process and sample the results, which several noted tasted no different than their usual supply. The recycling process typically entails disinfecting wastewater with ozone gas or ultraviolet light to remove viruses and bacteria, then filtering it through membranes with microscopic pores to remove solids and trace contaminants. Not all water can be recycled locally. Often, Western communities are required to send treated wastewater back to its source, so that it can eventually be used by other places that depend on that same body of water. “You have to put the water back into the river because it’s not yours,” said Patricia Sinicropi, executive director of WateReuse. As a result, much of the country already consumes water that’s been recycled to some degree, simply by living downstream from others. It’s why drinking water undergoes stringent sterilization even when it’s pulled from a river or lake that looks clean. Encouraged by efforts in other cities, even places with stable water supplies are considering recycling their own wastewater. After a poll showed broad support for the idea in Boise, Idaho, city officials began studying plans to recharge local groundwater with treated wastewater. “We need to be managing for the potential impacts of climate change,” said Haley Falconer, a senior manager in the city’s environmental division. The Southern California project, which still needs to undergo environmental review and finalize its funding plan, would also lessen the region’s need to pipe in water from afar. In exchange for financing from water agencies in Nevada and Arizona, the area is ceding some of its share of the Colorado River. “We’re taking advantage of a water supply that’s right here in our backyard,” said Deven Upadhyay, chief operating officer for the Metropolitan Water District. Officials emphasize the project uses technology that’s been used safely elsewhere, including in Israel and Singapore. The reassurances have become critical after a separate Los Angeles wastewater treatment plant, which uses a different process to purify water for irrigation and industrial purposes, flooded and spilled sewage into the ocean in July. “The last thing that any of us want is one of these projects that have a water quality hiccup that sets back public perception,” Upadhyay said.

" GLASGOW — The United Kingdom, host of the UN climate change summit in Glasgow, on Wednesday released a draft political decision, which will be negotiated over the next few days, urging countries to strengthen their national climate plans by the end of 2022. The first draft of the “COP cover decision” asks countries to “revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions, as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022.” The draft also reminds countries that under the Paris Agreement they can submit new, more ambitious climate pledges at any time and for the first time calls for countries to phase out coal and fossil fuel subsidies. It is being closely watched for what it might commit countries to do to bridge the gap between their current climate targets and the more ambitious action scientists say is needed to avert disastrous levels of warming. Diplomats from the nearly 200 countries represented at COP26 will hunker down on Wednesday to negotiate a final text they are all willing to sign when the summit ends this weekend. Poorer, climate-vulnerable countries have called for countries to cap warming at 1.5C — a temperature increase scientists say is just short of calamitous. The push for more regular reviews of climate plans is seen as necessary because countries’ current 2030 pledges would lead to 2.4C of warming. The draft also calls on countries to “accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels,” a demand of climate change campaigners and “urges” developed countries to “urgently scale-up” financial support for developing countries to respond to their needs to adapt to the impacts of climate change.

" HONG KONG — Tuvalu’s approach at the COP26 climate summit: Show, don’t tell. In a speech aired at the summit on Tuesday, the Pacific island nation’s Foreign Minister Simon Kofe is dressed in a suit and tie at a lectern in the water, his pant legs rolled up to his knees as he stands on what used to be dry land. Waters around Tuvalu, whose highest point is about 15 feet above sea level, are rising about 0.2 inches per year — faster than the global average. Like many of its neighbors, Tuvalu is warning that without global action, its land will almost certainly be submerged entirely. Pacific island nations like Tuvalu are among those most at risk from climate change, but coronavirus outbreaks and the difficulties of traveling in a pandemic have kept most of their leaders from attending the summit in Glasgow, Scotland.  In his speech, Kofe said the eight islands of Tuvalu were “sacred” to its 12,000 people. “They were the home of our ancestors, they are the home of our people today and we want them to remain the home of our people into the future,” he said. Their remoteness combined with early border closures made Pacific island nations among the last places in the world to be touched by the virus, with Tonga recording its first case in October. But some have experienced serious outbreaks this year, raising fears that their health systems could be overwhelmed. Travelers arriving from overseas often face stringent quarantine requirements. “At the end of the day that’s what we’re talking about, extinction of languages, culture and of people’s lives, and why should we accept that?” PALAU PRESIDENT SURANGEL WHIPPS, JR. SAID In the end, the summit was personally attended by the leaders of only three Pacific island nations: Fiji, Palau and Tuvalu. “Definitely you felt that void,” Palau President Surangel Whipps, Jr. said in an interview on Tuesday. Whipps said that before he left for Scotland he spoke with President David Kabua of the Marshall Islands, an atoll nation averaging seven feet above sea level that the World Bank said last month would be one of the first to face an existential threat from rising sea levels. “I could feel in his voice when he was talking to me,” Whipps said. “He was saying, ‘I really ask you to represent us because this is our last chance.’” In his speech at the COP26 World Leaders Summit on Nov. 2, Whipps emphasized the importance of keeping the average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. He also called on industrialized nations to greatly increase their climate funding commitments for developing nations, including funding for climate adaptation.  The resources of Palau, a nation of about 18,000 people, “are disappearing before our eyes,” he said. “Frankly speaking, there is no dignity to a slow and painful death,” he said in his speech. “You might as well bomb our islands instead of making us suffer.” Although some Pacific island nations have filled out their COP26 delegations with representatives from their missions in the United States and Europe, as a whole they have fewer high-level government officials and civil society representatives in Glasgow than at previous climate summits. Climate activists say that makes it more difficult to attend every meeting and pressure some of the world’s biggest emitters, including the U.S. and China. “It’s good when there’s solidarity and everyone is there to lend that voice and of course engage and talk to leaders and get them motivated to make the right choice,” Whipps said. A group of campaigners said Monday that the largest delegation at COP26 is the one representing the fossil fuel industry. An analysis by the group, led by international nongovernmental organization Global Witness, found that at least 503 industry lobbyists were on the provisional list of attendees. That is more than any single country, with Brazil coming closest at 479 delegates. Sam Leon, head of major investigations at Global Witness, said many fossil fuel companies represented at COP26 have a history “of denying climate change in the first instance and subsequently pushing false solutions that simply derail or distract from the primary focus, which has to be cutting emissions quite radically.” In the Pacific, many are watching the summit from afar.  Belyndar Rikimani and Atina Schutz, both climate activists studying law in Vanuatu, began planning their trip to Scotland months ago. But because they are not Vanuatu citizens — Rikimani is from the Solomon Islands, and Schutz is from the Marshall Islands —pandemic border restrictions would have prevented them from re-entering the country and continuing their studies after COP26. Others in the region, they said, were unable to attend the summit because of border closures, the high cost of flights and accommodation, or lack of access to Covid-19 vaccines. In Vanuatu, Rikimani said, the cost of a pre-departure Covid test alone was about 25,000 vatu ($225), which for some people is half a month’s salary. “It was just too much for some of us to afford to get everything in order,” said Rikimani, 24, who is vice president of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change. Though Rikimani and Schutz have participated in COP26 virtually along with three others from their group who are in Scotland, they have had to contend with technical glitches and vast time differences. “Being virtually there is just not the same as being physically present and being able to talk to people,” said Schutz, 23, awareness chairperson of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change. In Palau, Whipps said climate change had resulted in coral bleaching, drought, extreme heat and long periods when the tourism-dependent country’s famous stingless jellyfish disappeared. Changing weather patterns have also brought intense storms that homes were not built to withstand. And like their counterparts in Tuvalu, officials in Palau worry about the sinking of their islands, which have their own chiefs and sometimes their own language. “If the island is gone, how can you still be a chief?” Whipps said. “At the end of the day that’s what we’re talking about, extinction of languages, culture and of people’s lives, and why should we accept that?” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories."
" GLASGOW, Scotland — Across the river from where British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, United States President Joe Biden and more than 100 other world leaders are meeting to discuss how to tackle climate change, protesters dressed up as the summit's key political players and mimicked a giant game of tug of war. At other times, people wearing masks of Biden, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping play-fought over an inflatable beach ball of Earth. The Glasgow Actions Team, which organized the Tuesday demonstration, said it hopes the over-the-top antics send a clear message to politicians: ""Stop playing climate games with our future."" The activities were part of a ""Squid Game""-themed protest and featured people dressed in jumpsuits and helmets like guards from the hit Netflix show. The event was one of a number of demonstrations planned around the city over the next two weeks, as Scotland hosts the United Nations Climate Change Conference, also called COP26. On the second full day of the global summit, activists vowed to keep pressuring world leaders to put politics aside and take aggressive steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ""What we want world leaders to do is take their rhetoric, take their promises, pack them away and take action instead,"" said Fatima Ibrahim, co-executive director of Green New Deal U.K. Ibrahim said some progress has been made early on in the conference, including a landmark commitment signed Tuesday by more than 100 world leaders to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. But she added that addressing the climate crisis demands more than piecemeal promises. ""It means stopping all new fossil fuel infrastructure, rapidly decarbonizing our economies, delivering millions of green new jobs for ordinary working people who need a stake in this transition and securing a livable future for people and the planet,"" Ibrahim said. Eighteen-year-old activist Greta Thunberg took part in a protest Monday outside the conference venue, lambasting leaders for failing to uphold aggressive climate pledges. ""No more blah, blah, blah,"" she chanted along with the crowd. Thunberg and other well-known youth climate activists — including Vanessa Nakate from Uganda, Dominika Lasota from Poland and Mitzi Tan from the Philippines — released an open letter Monday saying political leaders have betrayed young people by failing to address climate change. The letter, which has more than 1.4 million signatures, urged world leaders to ""face up to the climate emergency."" ""This is not a drill. It's code red for the Earth,"" they wrote in the letter. ""Millions will suffer as our planet is devastated — a terrifying future that will be created, or avoided, by the decisions you make. You have the power to decide."" Ibrahim added that activists need to continue to push governments even after the climate summit wraps up next week. ""A two-week negotiation will never deliver something that satisfies us,"" she said. ""This is going to be the fight of our lives, and what we need is for that work to be done every day.""

" EAGLESHAM, Scotland — As President Joe Biden’s administration puts its muscle behind wind power with plans to develop large-scale wind farms along the entire United States coastline, the administration can look at how the windiest nation in Europe is transforming its energy grid for an example of how to proceed. In the search for renewable sources of energy, the United Kingdom has embraced wind power. In 2020, the country generated as much as 24 percent of its electricity from wind power — enough to supply 18.5 million homes, according to government statistics.  With usually reliable winds, the U.K. currently has the highest number of offshore turbines installed in the world, with China at a close second. Experts and industry leaders say it offers valuable lessons on creating a viable market for wind power at the ambitious scale the Biden administration hopes to meet in order to confront climate change and help transition the U.S. economy to renewable energy. “The U.S. is going to benefit hugely from the early investment that European governments have put into offshore wind,” said Oliver Metcalfe, a wind power analyst at BloombergNEF in London, an independent research group. On Oct. 13, the White House announced plans to lease federal waters off of the East and West Coasts and Gulf of Mexico to develop commercial wind farms. The move is part of Biden’s goal to have 30,000 megawatts of offshore wind power produced in the United States by 2030. The White House says that would generate enough electricity to power more than 10 million homes and in the process create 77,000 jobs.  But there is a chasm between where the U.S. is now and where it wants to be within the next decade when it comes to offshore wind power. “We’re the first generation to understand the science and implications of climate change and we’re the last generation to be able to do something about it.” LINDSAY MCQUADE, CEO SCOTTISHPOWER RENEWABLES The U.S. is not new to wind power; onshore wind in states such as Texas, Oklahoma and Iowa supplied 8.2 percent of the country’s total electricity generation in 2020, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.  But despite its long coastlines, offshore wind has been a largely untapped resource in the U.S. With a population of about 332 million people, the U.S. currently has just two operational offshore wind farms — off Rhode Island and Virginia — with the capacity to produce 42 megawatts of electricity between them.   In contrast, the U.K., with a population of 67 million people, has 2,297 offshore wind turbines with the capacity to produce 10,415 megawatts of electricity. Just outside of central Glasgow, the host city for the U.N. climate change conference known as COP26, the fruits of years of effort to move away from fossil fuels can be seen and heard Whitelee Windfarm, the U.K.’s largest onshore wind farm, spreads across 30 square miles on the Eaglesham Moor and includes more than 80 miles of trails for walking, cycling and horseback riding. Lindsay McQuade, CEO of ScottishPower Renewables, which owns Whitelee, calls it a “power station that’s also a country park.”  With its 539 megawatt capacity, it generates enough electricity for 350,000 homes — more than half the population of Glasgow.  On a recent gusty fall day, Ian and Fiona Gardner, both 71, were walking their dogs among the wind farm’s 360-foot-tall turbines   “This is a major contribution to Scotland, to become independent from oil by 2035,” Ian Gardner, an accountant, said.  Thanks to the rapid technological advances in turbine technology, this wind farm that was completed in 2009, is now practically old school. The latest crop of onshore turbines typically generate double the current capacity of Whitelee’s turbines. “It took us 20 years to build 2 gigawatts of power. And we’re going to double that in five  years,” said McQuade, an economist. “We can do that because machines are big, efficient, cheap and the supply chain is there.”  The biggest operational offshore wind farm in the world right now, Hornsea Project One, is about 75 miles off England’s Yorkshire coast in the North Sea. Owned and operated by Orsted, a former Danish oil and gas giant, in partnership with Global Infrastructure Partners, its 174 turbines have the capacity to generate 1.2 gigawatts — enough to power over 1 million homes and roughly equivalent to a nuclear power plant.  Benj Sykes, Vice President of U.K. Offshore Wind at Orsted, called Hornsea One a “game changer” in a recent phone interview, citing it as an example of how the industry has scaled up its output to compete with traditional power plants. But massive projects like Hornsea One took decades to get up and running, as well as government help. According to Malte Jansen, a research associate at the Centre of Environmental Policy at Imperial College London, the British government helped facilitate a “paradigm shift” in renewable energy in 2013. The electricity market reform policy set up a framework to incentivize investment in offshore wind farms by creating an auction system that guarantees electricity prices to developers in 15-year contracts.  This means there is no upside in terms of market price fluctuation, but there is no downside either. The policy essentially “de-risked the investment,” Jansen said. The state contracts allowed the industry to innovate and learn how to develop even larger and more efficient turbines with blades that stretch as long as 267 feet, about three-quarters the size of a U.S. football field.  While this approach helped companies and investors, it will also have an unintended beneficiary — the U.S., Metcalfe from BloombergNEF said.  Developers are “taking the lessons they’ve learned building projects in Europe, the cost reductions that they’ve achieved building projects in Europe and are now bringing those to the U.S. market,” he said. The U.K. is an example and a testing space for the U.S. when it comes to wind energy, and the technology is not without its drawbacks — namely, no energy is produced when the wind doesn’t blow. After record high wind power generation in the U.K. in 2020, lower wind speed in April to June of this year decreased wind power generation by 14 percent, according to a government report.   That drop added to the U.K. and Europe’s energy crunch.  Then there’s the people factor. Both  onshore and offshore wind projects have long generated opposition from local communities, fishermen and environmentalists who say the huge turbines jeopardize ecosystems, birds and marine wildlife. Rachel Connor, 65, a retired radiologist, lives near Whitelee  Windfarm and is a member of “Scotland Against Spin,” a grassroots organization whose 2,500 members campaign against what they say is the ceaseless spread of wind turbines across Scotland. They argue that wind turbines are destroying the landscape while energy companies profit.   To her, one of the big problems is that the public only hears the “green energy is good’’ side of the story and that they don’t hear from the communities that coexist with turbines the size of skyscrapers. “Our voices have been repressed,” Connor said. “We’re regarded as troublemakers, as cranks, as anti-renewables. Most of us are just ordinary people who are wind farm neighbors.” Back at Whitelee, McQuade bragged that the visitor’s center managed by the Glasgow Science Centre has had over 1 million guests.   She added that she had noticed a “palpable shift” in public attitudes toward climate change and renewables. “This is the decade of difference,” she said. “We’re the first generation to understand the science and implications of climate change and we’re the last generation to be able to do something about it.”  Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories.

" GLASGOW, Scotland — Two key deals announced Thursday signal progress among some nations in making the all-too-important shift away from fossil fuels to avert the worst impacts of climate change. The agreements, unveiled at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, included a pledge signed by 25 countries, including the United States and Canada, to stop public financing of overseas fossil fuel projects by the end of next year. The United Kingdom also unveiled its so-called Global Coal to Clean Power Transition Statement, which featured new commitments from 23 countries — including Poland, South Korea and Indonesia — to phase out coal power. ""Today, I think we can say that the end of coal is in sight,"" said Alok Sharma, president of this year's climate summit, which is known as the 26th ""conference of the parties,"" or COP26. Though optimism about how far these deals can go is tempered by inconsistent timelines for phasing out coal and caveats for funding overseas fossil fuel projects, transitioning the global economy away from fossil fuels is critical for keeping alive the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Jennifer Layke, global energy director at the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based research nonprofit organization, called the agreement to end funding for oil, gas and coal projects abroad ""a critical step forward."" ""As the clean energy transition speeds up, it is imperative that we accelerate energy access in developing countries and ensure a just transition that lifts everyone up and leaves no one behind,"" she said in a statement. The United States' participation in the agreement is significant, as the government provides billions of dollars each year to finance fossil fuel projects around the world. The newly announced deal is also more aggressive than a similar promise made by G-20 countries this year, which only focused on coal projects abroad. The independent climate think tank E3G said the COP26 agreement could result in countries and public finance institutions shifting more than $15 billion of financing toward clean energy. The agreement, however, is not binding, and it was not signed by several major energy funders overseas, including China, Japan, Germany and South Korea. It also doesn’t completely rule out public support for such projects in “limited and clearly defined circumstances,” according to a statement released by the U.K., which is hosting the climate summit. The Global Coal to Clean Power Transition Statement, led by the U.K., commits countries to end investments in new coal power plants domestically and internationally. Nations are also pledging to phase out coal power in the 2030s for major economies and in the 2040s for the rest of the world. U.K. Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said in a statement that the developments show the world is ""moving in the right direction."" ""Today marks a milestone moment in our global efforts to tackle climate change,"" he said, ""as nations from all corners of the world unite in Glasgow to declare that coal has no part to play in our future power generation.""

" GLASGOW, Scotland — The United Kingdom's longest-lasting patch of snow, located in a remote mountain range in the Scottish Highlands, has melted away for only the eighth time in 300 years, experts have confirmed. The snow patch, nicknamed the Sphinx, is the U.K.'s most durable, which means it typically stays frozen through the summer, even after most snow has melted across the region's upland terrain. The rare disappearance of the patch comes as Scotland plays host to the United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, during which government officials from around the world are negotiating policies to avert the worst impacts of global warming. The Sphinx snow patch adorns the side of Braeriach, the third-highest mountain in Britain that forms part of the Cairngorms mountain range. Records indicate that the patch is previously known to have melted completely in 1933, 1959, 1996, 2003, 2006, 2017 and 2018. Before 1933, it's estimated that the last time the snow patch disappeared was in the 1700s, according to Iain Cameron, author of ""The Vanishing Ice: Diaries of a Scottish Snow Hunter."" Cameron calls himself an amateur scientist, but he has spent the past 25 years studying snow across Scotland's hills and mountains and publishes his findings on the region's snow cover in the Royal Meteorological Society's annual report. He said it's concerning to see the patch disappear for the third time in five years, adding that global warming is likely contributing to the recent melting events. ""There's no doubt in my mind that the increased disappearance of the Sphinx is due in significant part to the changing climate,"" Cameron said. ""The rate of disappearance is accelerating dramatically."" A report published last year on snow cover and climate change on Cairngorm mountain found rising temperatures and decreasing snow cover across the region over the past 100 years. The report, commissioned by the Cairngorms National Park Authority, used climate models to project how patterns of snow cover could change in the future. Mike Rivington, a scientist at the James Hutton Institute in Aberdeen, Scotland, and one of the co-authors of the report, said snow's variability from year to year makes it challenging to study, but that the researchers found an overall trend toward less snow, in terms of the area it covers, and a decrease in its duration, or how long the snow stays on the ground. ""We found that once you get past 2040, there are a large number of years where the amount of snow cover decreases quite considerably,"" he said. ""By 2080, there may be some winters where we get very little snow cover at all, which doesn't mean it won't snow but it's unlikely to stay on the ground for very long."" The models also showed that melting will likely happen more frequently in the coming years. ""What that tells us is that we're losing those very cold temperatures that help maintain snow patches,"" Rivington said. ""And the fact that these melts are happening more frequently implies that global warming as a process is also accelerating."" Snow patches are good indicators of climate change, he said, because they tend to be sensitive to even small temperature changes. As such, what's happening in the Highlands can act as a bellwether for other parts of the country, and the world. ""The Sphinx is a keenly watched patch of snow because it has much wider implications,"" he said. Changing snow cover across the Highlands could have broader consequences for mountain ecosystems, he added, and disrupt the natural hydrological process of snow gradually melting from mountains and flowing into streams. ""There's all kinds of direct consequences, ranging from aquatic ecology to the microbiology in streams,"" Rivington said. ""But there are economic consequences as well, with things like winter sports. And in Scotland, we're the biggest whisky-producing country in the world and most of the water used comes off of those hills."" Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories.

" SOULAINES-DHUYS, France — Deep in a French forest of oaks, birches and pines, a steady stream of trucks carries a silent reminder of nuclear energy’s often invisible cost: canisters of radioactive waste, heading into storage for the next 300 years. As negotiators plot out how to fuel the world while also reducing carbon emissions at climate talks in Scotland, nuclear power is a central sticking point. Critics decry its mammoth price tag, the disproportionate damage caused by nuclear accidents, and radioactive leftovers that remain deadly for thousands of years. But increasingly vocal and powerful proponents — some climate scientists and environmental experts among them — argue that nuclear power is the world’s best hope of keeping climate change under control, noting that it emits so few planet-damaging emissions and is safer on average than nearly any other energy source. Nuclear accidents are scary but exceedingly rare — while pollution from coal and other fossil fuels causes death and illness every day, scientists say. “The scale of what human civilization is trying to do over the next 30 years (to fight climate change) is staggering,” said Matt Bowen, of Columbia University’s Center for Global Energy Policy. “It will be much more daunting if we exclude new nuclear plants — or even more daunting if we decide to shut down nuclear plants all together.” Many governments are pushing to enshrine nuclear energy in climate plans being hashed out at the conference in Glasgow, known as COP26. The European Union, meanwhile, is debating whether to label nuclear energy as officially “green” — a decision that will steer billions of euros of investment for years to come. That has implications worldwide, as the E.U. policy could set a standard that other economies follow. But what about all that waste? Reactors worldwide produce thousands of tons of highly radioactive detritus per year, on top of what has already been left by decades of harnessing the atom to electrify homes and factories around the world. Germany is leading the pack of countries, mainly within the E.U., standing firmly against labeling nuclear as “green.” Meanwhile, the Biden administration supports nuclear power, China has a dozen reactors under construction — and even Japan is promoting nuclear energy again, 10 years after the disaster at its Fukushima power plant. But nowhere in the world is as reliant on nuclear reactors as France, which is at the forefront of the pro-nuclear push at the European and global level. And it’s among leading players in the nuclear waste industry, recycling or reprocessing material from around the world. South of the World War I battlefields of Verdun, trucks bearing radioactivity warning stickers pull into a waste storage site near the village of Soulaines-Dhuys. They’re repeatedly checked, wiped and scanned for leaks. Their cargo — compacted waste stuffed into concrete or steel cylinders — is stacked by robotic cranes in warehouses that are then filled with gravel and sealed with more concrete. The agency that manages the waste, Andra, knows its scares people. “I cannot fight against people’s fears. Our role is to guarantee the safety of people and the environment and the workers on the site,” said spokesperson Thierry Pochot. The storage units hold 90 percent of France’s low- to medium-activity radioactive waste, including tools, clothing and other material linked to reactor operation and maintenance. The site is designed to last at least 300 years after the last shipment arrives, when the radioactivity of its contents is forecast to be no higher than levels found in nature. For longer-life waste — mainly used nuclear fuel, which remains potentially deadly for tens of thousands of years — France is laying the groundwork for a permanent, deep-earth repository beneath corn and wheat fields outside the nearby stone-house hamlet of Bure. Some 500 meters (yards) below the surface, workers carry out tests on the clay and granite, carve tunnels and seek to prove that the long-term storage plan is the safest solution for future generations. Similar sites are under development or study in other countries, too. If the repository wins French regulatory approval, it would hold some 85,000 metric tons (94,000 tons) of the most radioactive waste produced “from the beginning of the nuclear era until the end of existing nuclear facilities,” said Audrey Guillemenet, geologist and spokesperson for the underground lab. “We can’t leave this waste in storage sites on the surface,” where it is now, she said. “That is secure, but not sustainable.” The 25 billion euro ($29 billion) cost of the proposed repository is already built into budgeting by French utilities, Guillemenet said. But that’s just one piece of the staggering cost of building and operating nuclear plants, and one of the reasons that opposition abounds. All around Bure, street signs are replaced with graffiti reading “Nuclear is Over,” and activists camp out at the town’s main intersection. Greenpeace accuses the French nuclear industry of fobbing off waste on other countries and covering up problems at nuclear facilities, which industry officials deny. Activists staged a protest last week in the port of Dunkirk, as reprocessed uranium was being loaded onto a ship for St. Petersburg, demanding an end to nuclear energy and more research into solutions for existing waste. “Nuclear waste ... needs to be dealt with,” Bowen said. But “with fossil fuels, the waste is pumped into our atmosphere, which is threatening us from the risks of climate change and public health impacts from air pollution.” Some prominent scientists now embrace nuclear. They argue that over the past half-century, nuclear power stations have avoided the emission of an estimated 60 billion tons of carbon dioxide by providing energy that otherwise would have come from fossil fuels. U.S. climate envoy John Kerry says he’s changed his early career opposition to nuclear because of the greater necessity to cut emissions. “People are beginning to understand the consequences of not going nuclear,” said Kerry Emanuel, professor of atmospheric science at MIT. Amid a “growing awareness of the rise of climate risks around the world, people are beginning to say, ‘that’s a bit more frightening than nuclear power plants.’” Some activists want to end nuclear energy today, and others want to phase it out soon. But Emanuel noted examples of countries or states that shut nuclear plants before renewables were ready to take up the slack — and had to return to coal or other planet-choking energy sources. The current energy crunch is giving nuclear advocates another argument. With oil and gas costs driving an energy price crisis across Europe and beyond, French President Emmanuel Macron has trumpeted “European renewables and, of course, European nuclear.” The waste, meanwhile, isn’t going away. To make radioactive garbage dumps less worrying to local residents, Andra organizes school visits; one site even hosts an escape game. Waste storage researchers are readying for all kinds of potential future threats — revolution, extreme weather, even the next Ice Age, Guillemenet said. Whatever happens in Glasgow, “whether we decide to go on with the nuclear energy or not,” she said, “we will need to find a solution for the management of that nuclear waste” that humankind has already produced.

" GLASGOW, Scotland — The Biden administration on Tuesday announced plans to introduce some of the nation's strongest regulations against methane emissions from oil and gas drilling, part of a broader push to tackle climate change that White House officials are unveiling at the United Nations Climate Change Conference. The new rules, proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency, aim to curb methane emissions for new and existing oil and gas infrastructure, thereby reducing a significant source of pollution from fossil fuel companies. The regulations target methane leaks and instances when methane gas is purposefully vented, or flared, during the production process. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that is released into the atmosphere when coal, oil and natural gas are mined and transported, but microbes also emit methane in low-oxygen environments. Methane emissions have been responsible for roughly 30 percent of global warming since preindustrial times, according to the U.N. Environment Program. An estimated 75 percent of the country's methane emissions will be covered by the new EPA rules, according to senior administration officials. The American Petroleum Institute, an oil and gas lobby group whose membership includes Exxon Mobil and Chevron, appeared to support the proposal, saying in a statement that it is committed to ""building on the progress we have achieved in reducing methane emissions."" ""We will continue working with the agency to help shape a final rule that is effective, feasible and designed to encourage further innovation,"" Frank Macchiarola, the group's senior vice president for policy, economics and regulatory affairs, said in the statement. The EPA rules will be stricter than regulations on methane emissions that were set in 2016 during the Obama administration. Those rules were relaxed by the Trump administration, but methane standards were reinstated shortly after President Joe Biden took office. In addition to the EPA regulations, John Kerry, Biden's special presidential envoy for climate, announced Tuesday that more than 100 countries are set to join the United States and the European Union in pledging to collectively reduce the world's methane emissions by 30 percent by the end of the decade. Biden joined Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and others to launch the so-called Global Methane Pledge. Though the agreement has wide support, China, Russia and India are some of the key polluters who have not yet signed on. In his remarks, Biden called the Global Methane Pledge a ""game-changing commitment"" and one that will help keep alive the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius. ""This isn't just something we have to do to protect the environment and future,"" Biden said. ""It's an enormous opportunity for all of us, all of our nations, to create jobs and make many climate goals a core part of recovery as well."" The announcement is a key development in the global fight against climate change and one that will likely help Biden signal to allies that the U.S. is taking serious action on climate, even as divisions within his own party are threatening other aspects of his climate agenda. Methane accounts for a much smaller percentage of global greenhouse gas emissions compared to carbon dioxide, but methane's molecular structure makes it more readily able to absorb thermal radiation, meaning it can drive significant short-term warming. As such, methane has 86 times the warming potential of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period, according to the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Research published last year in the journal Earth System Science Data found that human activities contribute about 60 percent of global methane emissions. Agriculture makes up roughly two-thirds of that figure, and fossil fuel production and use account for most of the rest, the study found. Mark Brownstein, senior vice president of energy at the Environmental Defense Fund, said climate negotiations over the past 30 years have focused on carbon dioxide, but that tackling climate change requires slashing both carbon and methane emissions. ""There's this misperception that all climate pollutants are basically equal,"" he said. ""But some of these pollutants, methane chief among them, don't last in that atmosphere very long but are actually far more powerful in the short term than carbon dioxide."" The pledge is co-sponsored by the U.S., the world's largest oil and gas producer, and the E.U., one of the biggest consumers of natural gas. Brownstein said that partnership is significant, and should spur other nations to take part. Sarah Smith, a program director at the Clean Air Task Force, a nonprofit advocacy group, hailed the U.S. and E.U. leaders' involvement in launching the Global Methane Pledge. ""For too long this potent super pollutant has fallen off the agenda at major climate summits while its emissions have risen to all-time highs, pushing our planet closer to potentially irreversible tipping points,"" she said in a statement. ""By launching the Global Methane Pledge on the world stage, they've made sure that methane will be front and center — where it belongs.""

" Vice President Kamala Harris plans to travel to Queens on Monday to pitch heavy-duty electric trucks, climate friendly home heating and other domestic steps to combat global warming as the U.N. climate summit gets underway in Scotland, White House officials tell NBC News. Just after President Joe Biden arrives in Glasgow, Harris is scheduled to join Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm at a hangar at John F. Kennedy International Airport to announce $127 million in new federal funding for medium- and heavy-duty trucks that produce zero carbon dioxide emissions. They also intend to announce a new partnership the Energy Department will forge with HVAC makers to try to speed up development of electric heat pumps that can operate in colder climates. Homes and businesses make up one of the largest sources of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and shifting from gas-fired systems to heat pumps that can run on renewable power is seen as a key step to meeting long-term U.S. climate goals. Harris’ visit comes as the Biden administration is working to show it can credibly deliver on its promise to cut U.S. emissions in half by 2050 even as climate legislation in Congress remains in limbo. Granholm, a longtime advocate for electric vehicles, will head to Glasgow after the stop in New York as one of about a dozen Cabinet members attending the summit, known as COP26. “It's a one-two punch,” Ike Irby, the vice president’s climate advisor, told NBC News. “He's abroad advocating for climate leadership internationally. The vice president is here in the United States underscoring how Build Back Better, the bipartisan infrastructure deal will create jobs here at home, address the climate crisis here at home.” At JFK, Harris and Granholm are to meet with semi-truck driver Pat Brandon, who has shifted to operating a gas-guzzling truck to an electric one, White House officials said. Cars and trucks are responsible for about 29 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, more than any other source, according to the EPA. The push for climate-friendly heating systems will involve six HVAC manufacturers working to make their heat pumps more resilient to winter temperatures, a challenge historically for a technology that relies on transferring heat from outside air into homes. Harris also plans to meet with New York state officials and union leaders to emphasize the need for jobs in offshore wind and other renewable energy projects to be unionized. Offshore wind farms are expected to advance rapidly off the U.S. coast amid a Biden administration push to approve them and designate waters for wind turbines. Yet in the past, renewable energy jobs have been lower paying and less likely to be unionized than those in fossil fuels. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Rep. Gregory Meeks, both New York Democrats, will join Harris and Granholm for the afternoon event at JFK, the White House said. Although the Democratic spending plan, known as “Build Back Better,” that Democrats hope to vote on this week includes an unprecedented $555 billion in climate-related spending, the administration had to scale back initial ambitions that included a carrot-and-stick plan to force electric utilities to switch from fossil fuels to clean energy sources. Those challenges have complicated Biden’s argument during COP26 that the U.S. has stepped up climate and that other major polluters must do so as well. In another potential obstacle for the Biden administration, as the president headed to Europe late last week the Supreme Court said it would consider whether the Environmental Protection Agency has gone beyond its authority by attempting to limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. A ruling that undercuts the EPA’s authority would severely hamstring the Biden administration as it tries to replace the stronger measures that got dropped from the spending bill with federal regulations. “We'll see what the Supreme Court might have in mind,” Biden’s national climate adviser, Gina McCarthy, told reporters late Sunday. “But we're confident that the Supreme Court will confirm what those [courts] have before them, which is, EPA has not just the right but the authority and responsibility to keep our families and communities safe from pollution.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories.

" EDINBURGH, Scotland — President Joe Biden heads to a make-or-break global climate summit with one hand tied behind his back, with uncertainty over his ability to push the U.S. to forceful climate action muddying his message that other nations must step up. For months, Biden made no secret of the fact that he wanted to show up at the U.N. summit in Glasgow with powerful measures signed into law to prove the U.S. was making good on his ambitious pledge to slash emissions. If not a signed law, at least a successful vote in Congress. If not a vote, at least unanimous Democratic support for a deal he could say was “as good as done.” He will arrive Monday in Scotland with none of the above, as ongoing wrangling within his own party casts a shadow of ambiguity over landmark U.S. climate legislation. The most Biden can say with certainty is that the United States appears on the verge of making the largest investment in fighting climate change in human history — more than half a trillion dollars. “We’re not going to go there with any disappointment,” Gina McCarthy, Biden’s national climate adviser, told MSNBC after the White House unveiled its new spending framework Thursday. “He's going to go there meeting people knowing that the United States is all in again, and that they're going to have to run to keep up with us.” It’s a tough sales job for the president to make to wary foreign leaders who for decades have watched U.S. seriousness about climate change see-saw as power has shifted hands in Washington. Former President Donald Trump’s globally condemned decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord is never far from mind. Biden earned early points by acting on his first day in office to restore U.S. participation. But more recently, foreign leaders have been closely tracking the chaotic back-and-forth over the Democrats’ climate-and-spending bill for signs of how credible U.S. promises on climate really are. Whether Biden can successfully make that case on the global stage could play a major role in the summit, known as COP26, is a success or failure. “You have China and others questioning the U.S. ability to implement what it committed to and using that as a reason why they shouldn't be forced to do more than they've committed to, because countries like the U.S. talk a game that they're not delivering,” Alden Meyer, an expert on U.N. climate negotiations at the European think tank E3G, said. Biden has pledged the U.S. will cut greenhouse gas emissions at least in half by 2035. But whether that can be achieved — and how — depends largely on how the congressional spending fight plays out. The stakes couldn’t be higher. Scientists broadly agree that failure at this summit would lock the world into failure in its existential fight to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Even Biden’s global climate envoy, John Kerry, has called Glasgow the “last best hope” to prevent catastrophic climate change. “I think it's critical to have low expectations from Glasgow, but celebrate any step forward,” said Andrea Zanon, a former World Bank consultant and clean energy investor who’s attended multiple U.N. climate summits in the past. “These events unfortunately are messy. They are very bureaucratic. But the geopolitics of climate have never been so strong.” For Biden, getting powerful climate legislation through Congress was destined from the start to be arduous, complicated by Democrats’ razor-thin Senate majority that forced his party to pursue a legislative strategy requiring only 50 votes. Under Senate rules, bills that pass under that “budget reconciliation” process are strictly limited to taxing-and-spending, meaning any climate-related provisions had to be carefully tailored to be about dollars and cents. As Biden headed to Europe, first for the G-20 summit in Rome and then on to Glasgow, Democrats appeared to have largely coalesced around the $1.75 trillion spending plan, which includes a wide array of social spending programs in addition to climate measures. Yet no votes had been taken and it wasn’t entirely clear whether the plan had firm support from a few must-have senators. The most sweeping step the White House wanted included in the bill was called the Clean Electricity Performance Program, a $150 billion plan to pay electric utilities that switch quickly from fossil fuels to clean sources like wind, solar and nuclear and slap fines on those that don’t. But opposition from Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., forced Democrats to drop it, the most painful of several climate-related cuts the White House has been forced to make as original ambitions were scaled down. What Biden did get in what appears to be a near-final deal is money to incentivize cleaner energy – lots of it. The framework includes $555 billion in climate spending — an historic sum — including $300 billion in tax incentives for wind, solar and nuclear, and credits of up to $12,500 for buyers of electric vehicles. The Biden administration has scrambled to show the U.S. can still credibly meet its emissions-cutting targets even without the original carrot-and-stick plan for electricity, which makes up about one-fourth of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions. Senior administration officials have pointed out that a broader economic shift is already under way, with the price of generating wind and solar power plummeting in recent years and adoption of electric vehicles growing. The White House has also cited an analysis from the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm, showing the U.S. can still technically achieve a 50 percent reduction if everything else goes according to plan, including individual states taking aggressive action and federal courts allowing new federal regulations. “The climate crisis is a problem of epic proportions, so this was never going to be one-and-done, this bill passes and we’ve solved the climate crisis,” said Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president of the League of Conservation Voters. “This bill is truly transformational, certainly the biggest thing we've ever done on climate and environmental justice by far and it couldn't come a moment too soon.” Still, history provides a long list of reasons for foreign nations to be skeptical of big U.S. promises on climate. Many diplomats attending the Glasgow summit still recall the original U.N. treaty on climate change in 1992, which then-President George H.W. Bush would not support unless its goals were made voluntary. Then came the Kyoto Protocol to commit nations to binding emissions cuts, which the U.S. never ratified under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. U.S. credibility on climate was at a high under Obama, who helped broker the 2015 Paris agreement and introduced a Clean Power Plan to use EPA regulations to force dramatic emissions cuts from U.S. power plants. But the Clean Power Plan never took effect due to court challenges, and Trump in 2017 said the U.S. would quit the Paris deal. Alok Sharma, president of the COP26 summit and a British Cabinet minister, downplayed global skepticism about U.S. credibility, saying Biden’s emissions-cutting pledges have been ambitious. “Symbolically, I think it was really important that one of the first executive orders that President Biden signed was in fact to reenter the Paris agreement,” Sharma said. “I think there is a real commitment on the part of the U.S. to make sure that we deliver.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories.

" As governments pressure the private sector to limit greenhouse gas emissions, the world’s largest companies have turned to a financial product to offset their environmental footprints — carbon credits.  It’s a hot market, hitting all-time highs in volume and on track to be worth $1 billion in 2021, according to Ecosystem Marketplace, a market publication run by the environmental finance research nonprofit Forest Trends. And just ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference starting Sunday, the U.N. Environment Programme issued a report that said carbon markets could “help slash emissions” with clearly defined rules and transparency. But why are carbon credits important? And why does it matter whether they’re used or not? A carbon credit is a kind of permit that represents  1 ton of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere. They can be purchased by an individual or, more commonly, a company to make up for carbon dioxide emissions that come from industrial production, delivery vehicles or travel. Carbon credits are most often created through agricultural or forestry practices, although a credit can be made by nearly any project that reduces, avoids, destroys or captures emissions. Individuals or companies looking to offset their own greenhouse gas emissions can buy those credits through a middleman or those directly capturing the carbon. In the case of a farmer that plants trees, the landowner gets money; the corporation pays to offset their emissions; and the middleman, if there is one, can earn a profit along the way. But this only goes for what is called the “voluntary market.” There is also something called the involuntary or “compliance market.” In the compliance market, or involuntary market, governments set a cap on how many tons of emissions certain sectors — oil, transportation, energy or waste management — can release.  If an oil company, for example, goes over the prescribed emissions limit,  it must buy or use saved credits to stay under the emissions cap. If a company stays under that cap,  it can save or sell those credits. This is known as a cap-and-trade market. The cap is the amount of greenhouse  gases a government will allow to be released into the atmosphere and emitters must trade to stay within that limit.  Article 6 of the 2015 Paris  Agreement tasks national leaders with figuring this out on a global scale. So far, about 64 carbon compliance markets are now in operation around the world, the World Bank reported in May. The largest carbon compliance markets are in the European Union, China, Australia and Canada.  While politicians and business executives have discussed putting a price on carbon, the U.S. does not have a federal, wide-ranging cap-and-trade market for greenhouse gases.  Regulators, businesses and environmentalists have debated globalizing a cap-and-trade market for carbon. But it is challenging to agree on a common  time frame, common price, common measurement and transparency, said Alok Sharma, president of this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference, also called COP26. The voluntary market is on track to reach a record of $6.7 billion at the end of 2021, according to a September report from Ecosystem Marketplace. Currently, traders in the European compliance market project carbon prices to increase 88 percent to about $67 per metric ton by 2030, according to a survey released in June by the International Emissions Trading Association.  The voluntary market’s rapid acceleration over the course of the year is largely driven by recent corporate net-zero goals and interest in meeting international climate goals set out in the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius over  preindustrial levels. Critics of the voluntary market, where a company buys carbon credits from a business outside of a regulated exchange, point out that this does not lower the overall amount of greenhouse  gases released by buyers. They are simply offset, which gives corporations a way to claim they are eco-friendly without reducing their overall emissions. Critics call this “greenwashing.” Carbon credits can also be bought from projects that would have happened anyway. For instance, one investment company says they pay farmers to convert their fields into forests and sell those credits to corporations, according to Bloomberg. But several farmers claim they already planted trees through a government conservation program. Also, some of these carbon credits through these projects are not permanent. For instance, the international soccer governing body FIFA bought credits to help offset emissions from the World Cup in Brazil. But soon after, the trees were cut down. The project was suspended in 2018 after more trees were logged than all the credits sold. The voluntary market operates largely unchecked by federal or local regulators.  Because the voluntary market does not have a cap on how many tons of emissions can be offset, the driving oversight is a set of standards. There are a few respected standards organizations that validate carbon credits.  Verra, a Washington, D.C.-based  nonprofit group founded in 2007 by environmental and business leaders to  improve quality assurance in voluntary carbon markets, has set the most widely used standard to validate those credits, called the Verified Carbon Standard. Since the organization’s launch,  it has registered 1,750 projects around the world and verified almost 796 million carbon units. The three main things that make up the Verra Carbon Standard are: accounting methodologies specific to the project type, independent auditing and a registry system. This is to “make sure that both the buyer has confidence that they’re buying something that is actually legit, and that the sellers themselves have something valuable,” Verra CEO David Antonioli told NBC News. Still the firm supports accountability in the market space,  he said. “[If the voluntary market] is going to be effective at helping achieve the targets of the Paris Agreement, it is going to have to complement … either government action, or individual, or company internal reductions,” Antonioli said. “We want actual solutions here. And if someone’s just offsetting, that’s no good … we don’t support that.” The  U.S. Department of Agriculture has not adopted or set  its own standards for carbon credits. But it does finance carbon capturing projects and publishes data to help agricultural businesses capitalize on the market.  “We need to scale up … with the recognition that there’s going to be a lot of private investment,” said Robert Bonnie, the senior climate  adviser to the USDA secretary. “We don’t want to displace that investment. We want to, in essence, sort of encourage it to come in.” The USDA recently jump-started federal carbon credit regulation with a proposed climate partnership initiative, which would fund conservation projects on working land and quantify the carbon and sustainability benefits that come as a result of those projects.  The Growing Solutions Act, which is waiting to be heard in the House, would help farmers, ranchers and foresters learn about carbon markets and sell carbon credits through a third-party certification process overseen by the USDA.  The Environmental Protection Agency currently runs an acid rain program, which cuts emissions of sulfur dioxide by setting a similar cap-and-trade program. Under this program, emitters of sulfur dioxide can sell or save excess sulfur dioxide permits if they reduce emissions and have more than they need, or buy permits if they are unable to keep emissions below the determined level. California is the only state with a state cap-and-trade market for carbon. By 2030, the state aims to lower emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels. About 450 entities targeted by the market must deliver an overall 15 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the ”business-as-usual” scenario in 2020. Companies covered by the state law can purchase a certain percentage of carbon credits to stay under the emissions cap. California carbon credits are expected to increase by about 66 percent to $41 by 2030, according to the International Emissions Trading Association. Aside from California, Oregon considered a bill this year that would limit emissions from regulated sectors to reach a 45 percent reduction from 1990 levels by 2035, and an 80 percent reduction below 1990 levels by 2050. Washington recently passed a law this year that puts a limit on the amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted and then auction off allowances to certain highly pollutive sectors until that cap is reached. The state’s goal is to reduce emissions by 95 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Each year until then, the cap will be reduced allowing total emissions to fall. The program’s first compliance period will begin in 2023. Breaking news emails Be the first to know about breaking news and other NBC News reports.

" Ron Turney, a water protector of the White Earth Nation tribe, has been diligently photographing what he says shows the effects of drilling fluid spills and an aquifer breach in northern Minnesota, where a Canadian energy company finished replacement of a crude oil pipeline in September. The Line 3 replacement project, first announced by Enbridge in 2014, had been fiercely opposed by Native American tribes, environmental activists and celebrities — who more recently urged President Joe Biden to yank its permits — arguing the pipeline would only aggravate climate change and threaten waters where the Ojibwe people harvest wild rice. Already, he said, he's seen chemicals and muck foul what should be pristine wetlands and water. ""It's really frustrating watching a river die out here in front of your eyes,"" said Turney, who is a member of the Indigenous Environmental Network, a coalition of grassroots groups and environmental justice activists. He plans to bring his concerns to an international stage at a panel during the two-week United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26, which starts Sunday in Glasgow, Scotland. After last year's annual conference was scrapped because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2021 event is drawing heads of state and world leaders, such as Biden and members of his administration, including John Kerry, the nation's first climate envoy, and Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American in that position. At stake will be whether the nearly 200 nations can agree on cutting greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to a rapidly warming planet and catastrophic climate-related disasters, with the goal of reaching ""net zero"" emissions by midcentury. But while the issues that diplomats debate will have consequences for the entire planet, the lesser-heard voices of the Indigenous people, who have historically been excluded from conversations about managing their ancestral lands, plan to make their presence known through groups like the Indigenous Peoples Caucus and Cultural Survival, an Indigenous-led nongovernmental organization, and panels like the one in which Turney is participating. Some groups had expressed difficulty this year traveling to Scotland amid Covid travel restrictions. One-third of small island states and territories in the Pacific region, where rising sea levels imperil their very existence, are reportedly planning to not send any government leaders, The Guardian reported last week. ""It's frustrating jumping through hoops, and they give us the lip service and some acknowledgment,"" Turney said of the conference, ""but we want real policy change that truly acknowledges and respects our beliefs."" Tom Goldtooth, the executive director of the Indigenous Environmental Network, said in an email from Glasgow ahead of COP26 that Indigenous groups will be making a point to say the emission-cutting targets that have been touted by governments are meaningless if dependence on coal and other fossil fuels is not abandoned. ""We will be demanding the rights of Indigenous peoples to be fully recognized,"" Goldtooth, who is of Diné and Dakota ancestry, said. The struggle of Indigenous peoples, who are often on the front lines of the climate crisis, exemplified by the deforestation in the Amazon rainforest and wildfires ravaging tribal lands in the western United States, will be emphasized at COP26. Indigenous leaders and ""traditional knowledge-holders"" whose practices can be useful in mitigating and adapting to the effects of a changing climate will be featured at some events and at panels that are typically attended by climate activists, academic researchers and celebrities. The Indigenous perspective can't be diminished, the groups say, with the U.N. highlighting that while some 370 million people define themselves as Indigenous, or nearly 5 percent of the global population, they occupy and oversee a substantial portion of land, about 20 percent. In 2007, the U.N. adopted the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, a nonbinding resolution, that recognizes their human rights and fundamental freedoms. But advocates and academics warn that these groups throughout the world who are finding their own solutions in the climate crisis can't do it in a silo, especially when many of them don't have the power or financial influence to advocate for themselves. ""There are opportunities for Indigenous peoples to be recognized at COP26 — if only states and stakeholders are willing to listen and take action accordingly,"" said Kristen Carpenter, a professor and director of the American Indian Law Program at the University of Colorado. Native American activists and environmental organizations say they are counting on the U.S. delegation to ensure Indigenous communities are at the forefront. This month, when Kerry addressed a conference of the National Congress of American Indians, the nation's oldest and largest tribal organization, he painted a dire picture for Indigenous communities: The effects of climate change are threatening lands and livelihoods. ""Indigenous ways of life that have been sustained across the globe for thousands of years are also on the front lines,"" he said. ""Your resilience is critical for the world,"" Kerry said, adding the Earth's survival is ""inextricably tied to having the leadership of Indigenous peoples in our voice."" ""If countries don't get on board with us, leaving out the people who steward a lot of the lands, it's not just a moral issue anymore."" SAID PROFESSOR KYLE WHYTE That recognition, while important, needs to be backed up by action, said Kyle Whyte, a University of Michigan professor focusing on the environment and sustainability and a member of the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council. He co-authored a report published Thursday in the journal Science that found centuries of forced migration of Native people by European and American settlers has left them on marginal lands more exposed to hazards posed by climate change. He said tribal nations and Indigenous organizations' hands are tied from taking drastic measures or opposing projects on their territories, often getting pushback from government agencies and energy companies. After the Line 3 replacement project was completed, snaking more than 300 miles in Minnesota and cutting across tribal reservations and treaty lands, Native American activists and supporters marched in Washington this month to demand Biden take a more aggressive stance against fossil fuel projects. As the protests grew tense and led to dozens of arrests and an attempt to occupy the Bureau of Indian Affairs, calls escalated from demonstrators to amplify Indigenous leaders' voices. It's an example of Native people being fed up — and a warning to the ""current generation of privileged people who haven't learned their lessons,"" said Whyte, a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation. ""If countries don't get on board with us, leaving out the people who steward a lot of the lands, it's not just a moral issue anymore,"" he added. ""It will have a devastating effect on the speed at which the rest of the world will get to sustainability."" Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories.

" In what's being billed as ""the world's last best chance"" to curb the climate crisis, leaders from around the globe are set to descend on Scotland this weekend to pledge their commitments in the fight against global warming. For two weeks beginning Sunday, Glasgow will play host to the United Nations Climate Change Conference, during which nations are expected to negotiate targets to reduce emissions as part of a global plan to address the climate emergency. This year's meeting is the 26th ""conference of parties"" (hence called COP26) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the stakes at this year's event are high. Climate scientists have said time is running out for world leaders to act in order to avert the most devastating impacts of global warming. A report released earlier this week by the U.N. Environment Programme warned that existing national climate pledges are not enough to limit warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius, the aspirational target set forth under the Paris Agreement. And a separate U.N. report released in August found that climate change is intensifying, occurring at an accelerated pace and is already affecting every region of the planet. At the time, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres called the situation a ""code red for humanity."" World leaders will be under pressure to set forth ambitious targets to reduce emissions, but questions remain about whether the richest nations and the ones that have historically contributed the most to climate change will be aggressive enough in their commitments. Many developing nations make up a relatively small fraction of global greenhouse gas emissions, but they are disproportionately affected by sea-level rise, droughts, flooding and other extreme weather events that are exacerbated by climate change. Ahead of the conference starting Sunday, Pope Francis called for a ""renewed sense of shared responsibility for our world"" and urged political leaders to take action to give ""concrete hope"" to future generations. The pope is not attending the summit in person, but the Vatican is sending a delegation led by its secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin. President Joe Biden will be in attendance, along with 12 Cabinet members and senior administration officials. All eyes will be on the United States at this year's event, which marks the return of American officials to global climate negotiations since Biden officially rejoined the Paris Agreement earlier this year. More than 100 other world leaders are expected to be present in Glasgow including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. There are, however, some notable no-shows: Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Former President Barack Obama, who signed the Paris Agreement in 2016, will deliver remarks and take part in a roundtable discussion at COP26. In a statement ahead of the summit, he praised young activists for pushing older generations to take action. ""And if old folks won't do it, get out of the way, because these young folks are coming and they're ready to make sure that we have a sustainable planet and a better future for our kids and our grandkids,"" he said in a video statement released by the Obama Foundation. But while a lot is riding on the negotiations set to take place in Glasgow, efforts to address the climate crisis need to go beyond diplomacy and political grandstanding, said Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. ""The climate doesn't really care about summits,"" she said. ""The atmosphere cares about how much carbon dioxide goes into it, so if we want to limit warming to avoid the worst-case scenario, we need to do everything we can in order to reduce greenhouse gases.""

" LONDON — British royals usually do not go in for emphatic public pronouncements. Tradition and elegance, yes. Fiery statements, not so much.  Yet climate change is an issue that has not only prompted emotional public pleas from the royal family, but has united three generations of the monarchy ahead of the U.N.’s climate change conference, COP26, in Glasgow, Scotland. Prince Charles, Prince William and their wives plan to lend their star power to the event. Queen Elizabeth II had originally planned to attend in person, but pulled out after she received medical advice to rest following a recent hospital stay. Instead, she will deliver a recorded video address, Buckingham Palace said Tuesday. The conference has been billed as a last chance for world leaders to get climate change under control. Otherwise, experts warn that temperatures will continue to rise far above the 1.5 degree Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) target previously set out in the Paris climate agreement, resulting in further climate catastrophes, from fires and floods to the destruction of species. President Joe Biden, together with senior members of his Cabinet and former President Barack Obama, will be among 120 world leaders to attend the nearly two-week conference. Leaders are hoping it will result in ambitious emissions reduction targets as well as moves to protect vulnerable areas and communities. Royals rubbing shoulders with world leaders will cap weeks of events and interviews in support of action, from Prince William’s Earthshot Prize, which aims to find technological or policy solutions to the effects of climate change, to Prince Charles' declaring that he understands the frustration of young climate protesters. Before the Earthshot Prize ceremony in London this month, William made headlines when he appeared to criticize billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk for pursing space tourism.  “We need some of the world’s greatest brains and minds fixed on trying to repair this planet, not trying to find the next place to go and live,” he said in an interview with the BBC. But this royal focus on climate action does more than just raise public awareness; it also helps raise the family's own profile, according to Mike Goodman, professor of geography at the U.K.'s University of Reading, who studies celebrity and climate change. “They’ve had a long history of thinking of the environment. But it’s also an opportunity for him to develop his own brand as they move into a new era and other royals start to take over from the queen,” Goodman said, referring to William, the second in line to the throne. William’s passion for climate action comes on the heels of his father's and grandfather’s involvement with bettering the planet. Prince Philip, the queen's husband, who died in April, was long associated with animal conservation efforts and served as the president of the World Wildlife Fund. Charles has been promoting environmental issues long before it was daily news, and has often expressed frustration at the lack of attention his efforts have received. “The problem is to get action on the ground, which is what I’ve been trying to do for the last 40 years,” he told the BBC in an interview that aired last week. “Celebrities can put a spotlight on the issue, but sometimes the danger is that it appears superficial and it may not necessarily have a long-lasting impact because people move on to another celebrity issue quickly.”  In that interview, Charles also made common cause with young climate change activists, saying he understands their frustration that not enough is being done. “People should really notice how despairing so many young people are,” said Charles, who added that he refrains from eating meat or fish two days a week, and dairy products on Mondays. In addition to adding solar panels to his residences, the prince has also converted his Aston Martin car to run on surplus English white wine and whey from cheese processing. Despite their dedication to the issue, the royals have come under criticism for their own luxury lifestyle and production of greenhouse gases. Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, directly experienced this before they stepped back from their royal roles in 2020. British tabloids in August 2019 slammed the couple, who had previously spoken about the need for climate action, for taking a private jet to France. In past weeks, the royal family, who are known to be keen hunters, have faced calls from the U.K. news outlets to “rewild” parts of their large estates, which would include more tree planting and a return to a more natural way of caring for the land. Royal Estates, the body that runs their properties, said in a statement that it had a long history of conservation and biodiversity and was always looking for ways to improve. The advertising of their efforts in support of the environment extend to the royal website, which has a page dedicated to the royal household’s practical actions, including the use of hydroelectricity and organic farming.  The royal family is part of a long list of celebrities and public figures to throw their weight behind climate action, and William’s Earthshot Prize ceremony on Oct. 17 included appearances on the green carpet by actors Emma Watson and David Oyelowo.  However, the extent to which celebrity involvement with the cause makes a difference is up for debate, according to Alison Anderson, a professor of sociology at the University of Plymouth, who studies climate change and celebrity activism.   “Celebrities can put a spotlight on the issue, but sometimes the danger is that it appears superficial and it may not necessarily have a long-lasting impact,” said Anderson. It’s not only the royals who gain from their leadership on climate change. Their star power is also helping to boost the U.K.’s profile on this global issue after its departure from the European Union. Last Tuesday evening, the queen welcomed former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, along with other international political and business leaders to Windsor Castle as part of a Global Investment Summit aimed at highlighting the U.K.’s role in green investment and clean technologies. This issue, however, is different from many the more traditionally apolitical causes that the royal family generally supports. The younger royals, like William and his wife, Kate, are perhaps best known for their work on mental health, addiction and homelessness. Climate action, in contrast, requires more government buy-in for their activities to make a difference, according to experts, and the royals' activities are just a tiny fraction of what's needed for lasting change.  The U.K.'s Committee on Climate Change estimates that low carbon investment needs to reach around $68 billion a year to deliver the government's own net zero targets. The Earthshot Prize, for example, supported by companies like Walmart and Unilever, awards a grant worth $1.4 million to five winners a year to develop and scale up their ideas. That's a relatively small amount of money compared to the large sums needed to deliver lasting change, according to Goodman. “He’s doing the best he can,"" Goodman said of William. ""He’s using his profile and position of power and money to gather groups of people together to say the right things, and here they are doing something. It’s just not enough.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories. Rachel Elbaum is a London-based editor, producer and writer. "
" LONDON — Political leaders must give “concrete hope” to future generations that they are taking the radical steps needed to tackle climate change when they meet at COP26, Pope Francis said in a message released Friday. The United Nations summit runs from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12 in Glasgow, Scotland, and Pope Francis called for a “renewed sense of shared responsibility for our world” to spur action. “It is essential that each of us be committed to this urgent change of direction,” he said on BBC Radio. “The political decision makers who will meet at COP26 in Glasgow are urgently summoned to provide effective responses to the present ecological crisis and in this way to offer concrete hope to future generations.” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that the summit is unbelievably important, but the outcome is in the balance as talks will be difficult. Pope Francis said the summit would be tough, but also represents an opportunity. “These crises present us with the need to take decisions, radical decisions that are not always easy,” he said. “At the same time, moments of difficulty like these also present opportunities, opportunities that we must not waste.” The Vatican is sending a delegation to the summit, but the 84-year-old pope will not be going following surgery earlier this year. Pope Francis warned against the danger of isolationism and protectionism in dealing with the climate crisis. “We can confront these crises by retreating into isolationism, protectionism and exploitation. Or we can see in them a real chance for change, a genuine moment of conversion, and not simply in a spiritual sense,” he said. “This last approach alone can guide us towards a brighter horizon.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories."
" Under oath and facing harsh questioning, the heads of some of the world’s largest oil companies denied Thursday they knew their products were driving climate change and lied about it, saying they acted in good faith to cut emissions and were merely following the science at the time. Comparing oil companies to Big Tobacco, House Democrats brought the CEOs of ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP America before cameras for what they described as a “historic hearing” on the companies’ role for decades in climate disinformation.  Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who helped to organize the hearing, said he hoped the energy giants wouldn’t “follow the same playbook” as cigarette companies, who he said concealed information about their products’ harmful effects. “You are powerful leaders at the top of the corporate world at a turning point for our planet. Be better,” he said. “Spare us the spin today, really we have no interest in it.” As the CEOs testified virtually, Democrats confronted them with internal documents showing Exxon scientists acknowledging that burning of fossil fuels would cause climate change, even as the company’s leader at the time was calling the link “inconclusive.” “I do not agree there was an inconsistency,” Exxon CEO Darren Woods testified. “As science has developed, our science has developed.” Eager to portray themselves as dealing proactively with global warming, the CEOs emphasized the voluntary steps they’ve already taken. As public consensus about human-caused climate change has hardened in recent years, major energy companies have heavily publicized their limited investments in clean energy sources and embraced some government steps to curb emissions, such as putting a price on carbon and regulating methane. Yet Democrats on the panel dismissed those efforts as “greenwashing”— a cynical attempt to portray their operations as far more environmentally friendly than they are.  In one of the hearing’s most dramatic moments, Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., testified virtually while holding up two jars of M&Ms — one nearly full, illustrating the nearly $17 billion she said Shell would be spending this year on oil, gas and chemicals, and another nearly empty, depicting the less than $3 billion the company will spend on renewable energy like wind and solar. “Ms. Watkins, does this look like a huge undertaking to you?” Porter asked Shell President Gretchen Watkins. “To me, this does not look like an adequate response to one of the defining challenges of our time. This is greenwashing.” The immediate trigger for Thursday’s hearing was a scandal in July over an undercover video of an Exxon lobbyist detailing the company’s lobbying efforts against action on climate change. But congressional Democrats have wanted to grill Big Oil executives on climate for some time. This was the first time the CEOs have been under oath for a hearing focused on climate disinformation. House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney played part of the video showing the Exxon lobbyist saying that the company had cynically backed putting a price on carbon pollution as an “easy talking point” because it knew the policy in all likelihood would never actually happen. “They are obviously lying like the tobacco executives were,” Maloney said. Maloney announced that she planned to subpoena documents from all four oil companies about their climate-related spending on ads, public relations and “shadow groups” that she said the companies had thus far refused to provide, adding: “That ends today.” In 2017, researchers at Harvard University who analyzed decades of internal and public documents from Exxon determined that roughly 80 percent of the energy giant’s internal documents had acknowledged the fossil fuel impact on the climate, while roughly the same percent of the company’s public-facing communications such as advertisements had expressed “doubt” their product contributed to global warming. Republicans on the panel dismissed the hearing as a pointless attempt to embarrass oil companies that they said underpin U.S. economic security by providing reliable energy that the country needs. They also used the session as a chance to hammer President Joe Biden for actions they said had harmed U.S. energy independence and killed jobs, such as rejecting the Keystone XL pipeline. “The purpose of this hearing is clear: to deliver partisan theater for prime-time news” Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., said. House Democrats tried but largely failed to extract commitments from the oil giants to stop undermining climate change efforts through intensive lobbying and advertising.  Khanna, who oversees the committee’s subpanel on the environment, asked the CEOs to commit to reducing their production of fossil fuels, as called for by the Paris Agreement. The CEOs dodged, saying only they’d commit to reducing emissions from the energy they do extract. Khanna also tried without success to enlist the companies to tell their lobby group — the American Petroleum Institute, whose CEO also testified — to stop opposing electric vehicles. Maloney pressed the executives, one by one, to pledge to stop spending money fighting public policies to reduce emissions. None offered the simple “yes” that she was seeking. “Chairwoman Maloney, we spend a lot of money lobbying for climate change right now,” Shell's Watkins said.

" China is a country of epic contradictions. It is home to the world’s largest solar farm, a rolling ocean of 4 million panels high up in the Tibetan plateau that’s large enough to cover Manhattan. Some 600 miles to the east, in Inner Mongolia, are the belching smokestacks of the Tuoketuo power plant, the world's largest coal-fired power station and one of the biggest single sources of pollution ever created. On Sunday, at the start of COP26, the world may get a clue as to which of China’s two extremes will dominate the coming decades — and potentially shape the future of the world. For the next two weeks the United Nations climate change conference is being hosted in Glasgow, Scotland. And most eyes will be on the team dispatched from Beijing. China is the world’s largest polluter, pumping out more greenhouse gases than every other industrialized nation combined. Many countries, including the United States, are still not doing enough to avoid damaging temperature rises this century, most experts say, something that United Nations Secretary General António Guterres said Monday was a “thundering wake-up call” ahead of COP26. But China is coming under increasing pressure, not just because it is responsible for more than a quarter of global emissions, but because its promises to curb them have so far been less ambitious than those by the U.S., Europe and others. “My appeal to China is very simple,” Guterres told a press conference, “that they will reach net-zero before 2060 and they will peak emissions before 2030.” Some experts also worry that the current global energy crunch — which has left millions in China subject to power cuts and rationing that could last for months — may mean Beijing backslides even further on plans to wean itself off fossil fuels. The stakes couldn’t be higher. No matter what the United States and Europe do, the world cannot avoid damaging temperature rises “without China achieving its climate goals,” Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said. “We cannot afford for China to fail.” Even amid Covid-19, COP26 will be vast: 25,000 delegates, dozens of world leaders, and appearances from Pope Francis and the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. For many, it’s the best shot at softening an environmental calamity that has already been set in motion. The aim is to flesh out legally binding targets set in the 2015 Paris Agreement, keeping global temperature rises “well below” 2 degrees Celsius this century, preferably 1.5 degrees. But China's plans so far have been “highly insufficient” to hit those targets, according to the Climate Action Tracker, a leading nonprofit database in Germany. Instead, it says, Beijing’s policies are consistent with a 3-degree world, meaning sea-level rises, more extreme weather and possible mass starvation as swaths of the planet become inhospitable for crops and even human life itself. On Thursday, Beijing submitted its updated climate goals, known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs, ahead of COP26. But there was little new that hadn't been announced before, namely that China pledges to start reducing carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, which President Xi Jinping announced last year. The likely absence of the Chinese president, who has not left the country since the start of the pandemic, is also seen as ominous for hopes of any sort of major breakthrough.  Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment did not respond to requests for comment on the assessment that it’s policies are consistent with 3 degrees of warming. Beijing says it is ""fully in line"" with the Paris Agreement, but still characterizes itself as a ""developing country"" that is still in the process of urbanization and industrialization, an official from China's National Development and Reform Commission told state media this week. ""So energy consumption will continue to grow."" It’s fitting for this land of juxtaposition that China has both accomplished a vast amount on climate change while simultaneously not promising enough for the future. Gone are the days of China dismissing international pleas to curb spiraling emissions, its delegates wrecking previous climate summits by insisting wealthy countries shoulder the responsibility. Now it wants to be seen as the central player. On top of Xi's 2030-2060 pledge, last month he announced the country would stop funding coal projects abroad. Previously Beijing bankrolled more than 70 percent of the coal plants being built or planned globally, according to the Beijing-based International Institute of Green Finance. On renewables, Xi’s China added more wind energy last year than every other country combined. Its solar, hydroelectric and electric vehicle sectors dwarf any others, its 4.5 million electric cars making up nearly half of the global total. But quitting coal will be brutal for a country powered 60 percent by the black stuff. One estimate by Beijing’s Tsinghua University said its net-zero goal would cost an incomprehensible $46 trillion. Over the past 40 years, coal has turbocharged China’s rapid urbanization, keeping the lights on for 1.4 billion people, and powering the cement and steel industries that forge its infrastructure-based economy. Without coal, China would not have lifted 800 million people out of poverty. And its attempts to kick the habit are already causing complaints that will be familiar to any country that’s tried to phase out seemingly essential dirty industries. “The mines are all closed in my area — there are no more,” Zhou Duofu bemoans, saying he used to run mines employing 500 people in Hunan province. “My area was so prosperous,” he added, but government policy meant “we had to quit.” China isn’t taking action on climate change to please the West. The Communist Party sees climate change as an existential threat — both to the country and the party’s control over it, said Judith Shapiro, a China climate expert who teaches at the American University in Washington. This year, it suffered deadly flooding in Henan province, and 2020 was Asia’s hottest year on record, the United Nations said this week. Sea-level rises imperil low-lying megacities like Shanghai and its 25 million people. The Communist Party “is full of scientists and engineers,” Shapiro said, “and they are very much aware” this is a “long-term national security risk.” Now the party “has to consider whether this is a new threat to its legitimacy,” she said. In the short term, China may have another problem. It has been hit harder than anyone by the global energy crunch, buckling under a shortage of coal and increased manufacturing demands. For weeks, blackouts have plagued millions of homes and businesses across 20 provinces. Fallout from the crunch is a major worry ahead of COP26. Experts fear that the realpolitik of keeping the lights on means there’s less chance than ever of Beijing quitting coal in time. Indeed, Beijing has ordered all coal mines to operate at full capacity ahead of winter “This year we should have started to see significant reductions in fossil fuel emissions,” according to Ma Jun, director of China’s Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs think tank, who says every country will face these pressures. “But unfortunately we’re likely to see a rebound.” Beijing’s defenders say that while the United States may boast more ambitious climate promises, its governments are more focused on the short term and less likely to succeed than the dynastic vision set out by China’s technocratic one-party state. And while China is the world’s No. 1 carbon dioxide emitter, it isn’t even in the top 40 when those emissions are broken down per person. The worst large countries in terms of pollution per capita are Saudi Arabia, Australia, Canada and the U.S. Many international experts say there is also an inherent unfairness in global emissions calculations, which are based on what countries produce rather than what they consume. Put simply, the U.S. and others outsource much of their cheap and dirty manufacturing to China, allowing Americans to buy iPhones and Nike sneakers without taking responsibility for the carbon emissions they create. “China essentially became the repository of the world’s pollution when it rose economically,” Shapiro at the American University said. “Much of the developed world’s pollution has been displaced onto China.” China is also far from alone in needing to do more. The U.S., the European Union and Japan have slightly more ambitious policies than Beijing, according to the Climate Action Tracker, but these are still “insufficient” to hit the 1.5-degree target. Nigeria and the United Kingdom are among those rated “nearly sufficient.” Gambia is the only “sufficient” country. In this scale, China sits on a de facto naughty step along with Russia, Australia, Saudi Arabia and Canada — even when adjusted for their “fair share,” based on historical emissions and ability to act. John Kerry, President Joe Biden’s special climate envoy, has put pressure on Beijing for being one of the few powers that haven’t adopted COP26’s net-zero target of 2050. “We can’t get where we need to go if China isn’t joining in that effort,” he told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” last month. But forget 2050, the only way to avert a crisis is for China to start acting almost immediately, reducing emissions by 2025 rather than 2030, according to Shuo Li, a senior global policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia based in Beijing. “That will create a lot of global momentum and it will earn China that global respect that it desires,” he said. “We need to embrace the hard work now.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories.

" BERLIN — The United Nations is summoning an unusual “witness” to testify to the dangers of burning fossil fuels that stoke global warming: a dinosaur. In a video released on social media ahead of this year’s U.N. climate change summit, a computer-generated dinosaur bursts into the U.N.’s famous General Assembly hall in New York to tell world diplomats that “going extinct is a bad thing.” The light-hearted clip, voiced in the English version by actor Jack Black, carries a serious message that the U.N. Development Programme hopes to drive home. “You’re headed for a climate disaster,” the dinosaur proclaims. “And yet every year, governments spend hundreds of billions of public funds on fossil fuel subsidies. Imagine if we had spent hundreds of billions per year subsidizing giant meteors.” In an accompanying report released Wednesday, the U.N. agency says its research shows that the world spends more than four times as much each year, about $423 billion, to subsidize fossil fuels for consumers than it does to help poor countries tackle global warming. The figure doesn’t include the indirect costs of burning oil, coal and gas, such as the harm fossil fuel emissions do to the environment and human health. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has repeatedly called for an end to subsidies on fossil fuels, something many governments are wary of because of fears higher prices could spark social unrest. The head of the U.N. Development Programme, Achim Steiner, acknowledged that reforming the system of fossil fuel subsidies would not be easy and might look different in each country. “But we also know that we must move away from these energy sources that are contributing to our planet’s decline,” he said. “Ending financial support for them in a way that is fair and equitable is a critical element of that transition.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories."
" Greenhouse gas concentrations hit a new record high last year and increased at a faster rate than the annual average for the last decade despite a temporary reduction during pandemic lockdowns, the World Meteorological Organization said in a report published Monday. The news came as the United Nations climate office warned that the world remains off target for meeting its goal of cutting emissions as part of international efforts to curb global warming. Both announcements came days before the start of a U.N. climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland. Many environmental activists, policymakers and scientists say the Oct. 31-Nov. 12 event, known as COP26 for short, marks an important and even crucial opportunity for concrete commitments to the targets set out in the 2015 Paris climate accord. “The Greenhouse Gas Bulletin contains a stark, scientific message for climate change negotiators at COP26,” World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said of his agency’s annual report on heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. “At the current rate of increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, we will see a temperature increase by the end of this century far in excess of the Paris agreement targets of 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius (2.7-3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.” According to the report, concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide were all above levels in the pre-industrial era before 1750, when human activities “started disrupting Earth’s natural equilibrium.” The report draws on information collected by a network that monitors the amount of greenhouse gases that remain in the atmosphere after some quantities are absorbed by oceans and the biosphere. In its report, the Geneva-based agency also pointed to signs of a worrying new development: Parts of the Amazon rainforest have gone from being a carbon “sink” that sucks carbon dioxide from the air to a source of CO2 due to deforestation and reduced humidity in the region, it said. “One of the striking messages from our report is that the Amazonian region, which used to be a sink of carbon, has become a source of carbon dioxide,” Taalas said. “And that’s because of deforestation. It’s because of changes of the global local climate, especially. We have less humidity and less rainfall.” Oksana Tarasova, chief of WMO’s atmospheric and environment research division, said the results showing the Amazon going from sink to source were a first, but he noted they were from a specific southeastern portion of the Amazon, not the entire rainforest. The U.N. climate office said separately Monday that its assessment of the formal commitments made by countries that signed up to the Paris accord suggests the world could reduce its emissions by 83-88 percent by 2050 compared with 2019. More worryingly, emissions in 2030 are projected to be 16 percent higher than in 2010, based on formal pledges so far. “Such an increase, unless changed quickly, may lead to a temperature rise of about 2.7C (4.9F) by the end of the century,” the U.N. said. Experts argued that emissions must halve by 2030 compared with 2010 levels and essentially hit zero by mid-century, if the Paris goal of capping global warming at 2C, ideally no more than 1.5C, is to be achieved. “Overshooting the temperature goals will lead to a destabilized world and endless suffering, especially among those who have contributed the least to the GHG emissions in the atmosphere,” said Patricia Espinosa, who heads the U.N. climate office. “We are nowhere near where science says we should be,” she added. Alok Sharma, who will preside over the U.N. talks in Glasgow, said progress had been made since the Paris deal was struck in 2015, when projections of existing emissions cuts pointed to warming of up to 4C. The global average concentration of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, hit a new high of 413.2 parts per million last year, according to the WMO report. The 2020 increase was higher than the annual average over the last decade despite a 5.6 percent drop in carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels due to COVID-19 restrictions, WMO said. Taalas said a level above 400 parts per million — which was breached in 2015 -- “has major negative repercussions for our daily lives and well-being, for the state of our planet and for the future of our children and grandchildren.” Human-incurred carbon dioxide emissions, which result mostly from burning fossil fuels like oil and gas or from cement production, amount to about two-thirds of the warming effect on the climate. WMO said overall, an economic retreat last year because of the pandemic “did not have any discernible impact on the atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases and their growth rates, although there was a temporary decline in new emissions.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories."
" AHRWEILER, Germany — Layers of dried mud on sidewalks, concrete roads turned to gravel and time-worn stone bridges washed away. Three months after this summer’s catastrophic floods in Germany’s Ahrweiler region, there are reminders everywhere of the destruction they wrought. The deluge, which was preceded by three consecutive summers of drought, has brought a new urgency for many to find climate change solutions — and that has impacted Germany’s politics, too. In last month’s federal election, the environmentalist Green Party had its best results yet, winning nearly 15 percent of the vote, and trailing just behind the two largest parties. Unlike in the United States where the issue is still subject to debate, global warming is a key concern in Germany that voters increasingly expect politicians to address.  Its prominence in the election was no surprise to architect Florian Trummer, 65, whose hometown of Antweiler was hit by the floods. He officially joined the Green Party two months ago after a lifetime of swing voting. “I have to admit that in the past, I did not always vote for the Greens,” he said. “With the elections looming this year, I felt compelled to do something. The conventional parties play hide and seek, they say one thing, but mean another. They did not take the implementation of the climate goals seriously.” Unlike foreign policy, which hardly got a mention in pre-election debates, climate change was a top focus before the vote. The issue also spurred tens of thousands of Germans to gather days before the election at a climate action protest outside parliament in Berlin featuring the famed young Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. Also, a handful of young people declared a hunger strike in August to push politicians to acknowledge that there’s a climate emergency. This attitude isn’t unique to Germany — a recent Pew survey found that intense concern about climate change has increased sharply among people in several advanced economies. Remarkably, the share of people in Germany who are very concerned that climate change will harm them personally at some point during their lives has increased 19 percent since 2015, according to the survey published in September. In contrast, in the U.S., that number has decreased 3 percent. The difference in the urgency to fight climate change felt by the American and the German electorates comes as a result of decades of environmental messaging in Europe, according to Andreas Goldthau, a research leader at the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies in Potsdam, Germany. “The whole idea of the environment being important is something that has been with most of the European electorate for the last 40 years,” he said. “So, voters understand climate change, they can make sense of it, and it is a topic they can engage with.” “We need an energy transition.” WINEGROWER CHRISTOPH BAECKER  Winegrower Christoph Baecker has taken those environmental lessons to heart over the years. His winery, one of the first in the region to go organic in 1990, stands in the middle of the picturesque Ahr Valley, where vineyards line the sides of steep hills.  His home, around 10 miles from the river, was severely damaged in July’s floods. The waters also washed away around a third of his vineyards, destroyed nearly all of his equipment and contaminated many barrels of grapes from the harvest. He described how the morning after the flood, his property looked like a parking lot, filled with cars carried from elsewhere in the region by the floodwaters.  “It is clear that the catastrophes are not only hitting closer to home, but they are also occurring more frequently,” Baecker, 60, said. “We have had flooding in the past, but this type of weather constellation, with so much rain in such a short time, we have not seen before.” Not far from his home, piles of debris, wood and waste still line the banks of the shallow Ahr river, and heavy machinery is on hand to reconstruct streets, houses and riverbanks. The flood’s damage to the region’s wine industry alone is estimated at $175 million, according to the Ahr Wine umbrella organization for winemakers. Baecker believes that it could take five to 10 years for the area to rebuild. As it does, he wants the government to take the lessons learned from the floods more seriously. “It is important that the next government ensures that there is less burden on the environment,” he said. “We need an energy transition.” Baecker is not alone. A study published last month by the market research company Kantar showed that the number of shoppers polled in Germany who made changes to be more sustainable in the last year was up nearly 9 percent, compared to just over 1 percent of those polled in the U.S. Voters in Germany are paying ever-closer attention to how the main political parties address the issue. In the recent election, the Green Party nearly doubled its 2017 results, and is now likely to be not only part of a new coalition government, but also influential in choosing a successor to outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel. Last week, the Greens, the center-left Social Democrats and the pro-business Free Democrats announced that they plan to open formal coalition talks. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics It won’t be the Green Party’s first time as a member of a coalition government. Started as a grassroots movement in the 1980s, it became the junior partner in a coalition with the Social Democrats in 1998 and stayed in government until 2005. Germany’s abandonment of nuclear power is largely attributed to the Greens’ influence. Despite the prominence of climate change and environmental issues in Germany, implementing solutions quickly may be more of a challenge, according to Richard Youngs, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Europe think tank. “Even a country as well organized and prosperous as Germany can struggle to be prepared for the environmental crisis that we are likely to suffer,” he said. “Protests and other ways of having citizens involved in climate action do now seem to be a way of pushing governments toward more ambitious climate action in a way that wasn’t the case 10 or 15 years ago.” For Trummer and his fellow Green Party members, it’s more important than ever to continue bringing the dangers of climate change to light so mainstream solutions can be found.  “The Greens today are politically relevant, they deal with reality, they want to move things forward,” he said.

" WASHINGTON — Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., appears set to jettison the cornerstone of President Joe Biden's climate agenda, potentially leaving Biden with little to offer the world when he heads to global climate talks in Scotland next month. It isn't surprise coming from Manchin, who famously ran for re-election in 2010 with a TV ad in which he literally shot his party's last major legislative attempt to control greenhouse gas emissions. But that doesn't mean Manchin and his coal-rich mountain state don't love a lot of provisions climate activists are pushing for, like jobs, wind and solar programs — if only they would stop calling them ""climate change"" measures. ""I just wish the Senate would focus more on the actual impacts of these policies. When you lump it all together, you lose the majority of people who you need to get things done,"" said Benji Backer, who founded the American Conservation Coalition in 2017 for young conservatives and libertarians who care about climate change but feel alienated by the mainstream environmental movement. ""I'm a climate change activist, and I talk about climate change all the time, but you have to meet people where they are."" Getting Democrats to abandon ""climate"" as a talking point may be difficult, even if it would get their more moderate members on board. The left wing of the Democratic Party has spent years telling its voters that the conditions are dire and that something monumental needs to be done immediately. Returning to voters seemingly empty-handed after having promised to deliver substantial ""climate"" legislation could create its own political problems. Research has found that talking about ""climate change"" is an effective way to mobilize liberal voters compared to ""extreme weather,"" even if it has some negative effects for others. The climate movement is beginning to have a bit of a reckoning over its rhetorical approach, which for years has assumed that any real action needs to start with first convincing people of the science of catastrophic climate change and the urgent need to address it before getting into specific solutions. But many wonder whether that approach is backward. Some activists have begun to argue that a wider proportion of Americans are amenable to policies that combat climate change if you talk less about ""climate change"" — because the issue has become so polarized — and more about the specific impact on jobs, the economy and the environment. Backer pointed to Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a villain second only to former President Donald Trump in the minds of many liberals, who advanced landmark legislation this year to help the flood-prone state prepare for rising sea levels. DeSantis almost never mentions climate change, but he talks often about ""sea level rise"" and ""intensified storms"" and says ""resiliency"" is ""a top priority for my administration."" ""It's all pushing towards a pro-climate future, but he's not using the right words, and so people go after him,"" Backer said. ""And people who do use the right words don't do anything, and they get applauded."" Rep. John Curtis, a Republican who represents a deeply conservative part of rural Utah, is the leader of the new Conservative Climate Caucus, which has 72 members. Instead of climate change, he talks about air quality, forest fires and the impact of decreasing snowpack from warmer winters on ski resorts in his district. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, talks about the jobs and resilience of clean energy in Texas, which produces more wind power than any other state and is on track to catch up to California in utility-scale solar power in the next few years. Nationalism can also be a uniting factor. In a hopelessly divided Congress, both parties came together this year to overwhelmingly pass a bill to counter China that included investments in clean energy and electric vehicles but was not billed as a climate measure. ""When we talk about clean energy, emphasizing clean jobs here in America, the effects of reduced pollution and the lower electricity bills are effective ways to win over independent and even Republican voters,"" said Sean McElwee, the founder of the liberal think tank Data for Progress, which conducts extensive polling. The group's polling has found that support for Biden's clean energy and climate legislation increases when voters are given more information about specifics like infrastructure investment, job creation and pollution reduction. It's a message Biden has emphasized at times, too, such as his saying in his joint address to Congress this year, ""When I think climate change, I think jobs."" Sabine Marx, the director of research for the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University's Earth Institute, has described the approach as ""leading to"" climate change, rather than ""leading with"" climate change. ""If I know there are steps that I can take towards actionable solutions, then I am much more likely to accept that there's a problem,"" she told State of the Planet, a Columbia Climate School publication. According to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, 60 percent of registered voters say global warming should be a high or a very high priority for Washington, a robust majority that so far has not been big enough to force action. But when Yale researchers asked about specific policies irrespective of their climate impacts, support was much higher. For example, 86 percent supported providing tax incentives to make buildings more efficient, 81 percent supported more funding for research into renewable energy, and 70 percent support moving the U.S. economy from fossil fuels to 100 percent clean energy by 2050. In Manchin's West Virginia, surveys have found that fewer than half of voters think climate change is caused primarily by humans and that only about a third say reducing carbon emissions is an important part of Biden's infrastructure bill. But that doesn't necessarily mean West Virginians are hostile to clean energy. The state has several major wind farms, and it is building more, placing it in the middle of the pack nationally and above blue states like Massachusetts, which has faced intense local opposition to harnessing its vast offshore wind energy potential. The top four wind-producing states, according to federal data, all voted overwhelmingly for Trump: Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma and Kansas. ""We don't want to forget about the coal and natural gas industries, but we want to welcome the alternatives,"" West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Democrat-turned-Republican who has mocked the idea that climate change will have apocalyptic impacts, said at the groundbreaking for a wind farm in January. It might be too late to persuade Manchin to change his mind and rescue Biden's agenda. But Backer said a messaging reset could help turn the tide for voters in places like West Virginia who are alienated by cultural stereotypes about what kind of Americans support climate action. Climate activists ""are measuring success not by policy outcomes but by things that are perceived as wins so we can take it back and campaign on it,"" he said. ""It shouldn't be about what sounds good. It should be about what does good."" Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories.

" The risk of extreme heat is a rising threat to fast-growing cities around the world, according to a new study published this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  As more people move to cities and the climate warms, extreme heat could harm and kill more people, reduce worker productivity and hurt economies, the study says. The urban poor are most at risk.  The study, which assessed more than 13,000 cities from 1983 to 2016, found that global extreme heat exposure increased nearly 200 percent over that time period, a result of population growth, climate change and the fact that city infrastructure absorbs more heat. Nearly a quarter of the world’s population is in areas where extreme heat exposure is rising, the study says.   Researchers have lacked a complete picture of heat’s impacts because some fast-developing parts of the world don’t have reliable weather station data, and climate models used to estimate temperatures tend to gloss over urban hot spots.  The study took a novel approach and used satellite data to measure heat worldwide, giving researchers a sharper global view of the problem. The analysis reveals that many people flocking to cities in rapidly urbanizing areas such as southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are coming to places that are increasingly vulnerable to soaring temperatures and high humidity.  “Population growth isn’t inherently the problem, much less urbanization,” said Cascade Tuholske, a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University’s Center for International Earth Science Information Network and the lead author of the PNAS paper. “It’s the lack of planning and lack of investment in these rapidly urbanizing areas — but that can change.”  A separate report published Wednesday on climate change’s health effects suggests the problem is intensifying and inequities between rich and poor countries are growing.  The Lancet Countdown, a yearly assessment of health risks from climate, found that children and people 65 and older have seen a steady increase in exposure to heat waves over the last decade. Over the past 30 years, countries with low and medium levels of development have seen the largest increases in vulnerability to heat, which was made worse because many of these communities lacked access to air conditioning, cooling and urban green spaces. The report also says climate change is increasing conditions suitable for infectious disease pathogens, reversing global progress in providing food and water security and increasing exposure to wildfires.  Heat can harm or kill in multiple ways. The body’s organs can overheat dangerously if it loses the ability to regulate temperature, risking death. Heat can also exacerbate symptoms from underlying ailments such as cardiac disease, diabetes or kidney problems. In June, a record heat wave in the Pacific Northwest in the United States killed hundreds when temperatures climbed to 108 degrees Fahrenheit in Seattle and 116 in Portland, Oregon. Scientists have said temperatures so extreme would have been nearly impossible if not for climate change. Temperatures, though, remain just one concern. Humidity, sun exposure and wind also affect the body. High humidity, for example, can reduce the body’s ability to cool itself with sweat. In the study of heat risk across the world’s cities, the authors used a measure called wet-bulb globe temperature to assess these factors. Wet-bulb globe temperatures are often used to determine how heat affects people during strenuous activities such as military exercises, sports or outdoor work.  When wet-bulb globe temperature measures reach 86 degrees Fahrenheit, conditions are unhealthy for many people and deaths rise among those vulnerable to heat, the PNAS paper says. Those conditions could feel roughly equivalent to a heat index of about 107 degrees, Tuholske said.  To understand trends in heat impacts, authors of the PNAS study estimated wet-bulb globe temperatures and heat index measures for thousands of cities using satellite thermal imaging data and combining them with readings on the ground. Then, they compared temperature data to population maps to understand how many people were affected by extreme heat.  The authors estimate that the global population experienced a total of about 40 billion days when wet-bulb temperatures hit at least 86 degrees in 1983. In 2016, that number had nearly tripled to 119 billion, the paper says. Two-thirds of the change was due to population growth. The rest of the increase was due to climate change and additional heat due to urbanization.  The researchers argue that some previous studies of global urban heat have underestimated its impact because some areas don’t offer reliable weather station observations. In India, for example, just 111 of more than 3,000 cities assessed offered good observation data, the paper says.  “Four billion people live 20 or more kilometers (about 12.4 miles) away from a weather station,” Tuholske said.  Climate models often used in this type of analysis tend to minimize extremes and aren’t designed to evaluate important small-scale differences in heat across cities. For example, areas with fewer trees and more pavement tend to absorb more heat, making some parts of cities 10 or even 20 degrees hotter than others nearby.  Kristie Ebi, a professor in the University of Washington Center for Health and the Global Environment who studies health and heat waves, said the use of satellite data provided valuable new analysis and clarifies to what extent population trends are contributing to increasing heat vulnerability.  The study has limitations, though, she said.  Communities have different vulnerabilities and thresholds for when heat becomes dangerous, Ebi said, something the paper does not take into account.  The world already has warmed by more than 1 degree Celsius (about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) since the 19th century, and it’s “unequivocal” that humans are heating the planet, according to the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report released in August.  Scientists expect more frequent and intense heat waves as humans continue to burn fossil fuels and warm the planet. Some cities are preparing: The mayor of Seville, Spain, announced this week that his city will name and categorize heat waves similar to how meteorologists treat hurricanes.  “People go to cities because there’s more opportunities,” Ebi said. “There are reasons that cities are growing. The question, then, is how do you grow cities in ways that take into account a warmer climate?” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories.

" DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — One of the world’s largest oil producers, Saudi Arabia, announced Saturday it aims to reach “net zero” greenhouse gas emissions by 2060, joining more than 100 countries in a global effort to try and curb man-made climate change. The announcement was made by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in brief scripted remarks at the start of the kingdom’s first-ever Saudi Green Initiative Forum. It was timed to make a splash a little more than a week before the start of the global COP26 climate conference being held in Glasgow, Scotland. Although the kingdom will aim to reduce its emissions, Prince Mohammed said the kingdom would do so through a so-called “Carbon Circular Economy” approach. That approach focuses on still unreliable carbon capture and storage technologies over efforts to actually reduce global reliance on fossil fuels. The announcement only pertains to Saudi Arabia’s efforts within its national borders, and does not impact its continued aggressive investment in oil and exporting its fossil fuels to Asia and other regions. “The transition to net zero carbon emissions will be delivered in a manner that preserves the kingdom’s leading role in enhancing the security and stability of global energy markets, particularly considering the maturity and availability of technologies necessary to manage and reduce emissions,” a statement by the Saudi Green Initiative forum said. The kingdom’s oil and gas exports form the backbone of its economy, despite efforts to diversify away from reliance on fossil fuels for revenue. The global summit COP26 starting Oct. 31 will draw heads of state from across the world to try and tackle global warming and its challenges. It is being described as “the world’s last best chance ” to prevent global warming from reaching dangerous levels. The summit is expected to see a flurry of new commitments from governments and businesses to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases. Leaked documents first reported by the BBC emerged Thursday showing how Saudi Arabia and other countries, including Australia, Brazil and Japan, are apparently trying to water down an upcoming U.N. science panel report on global warming. The documents are purportedly evidence of the way in which some governments’ public support for climate action is undermined by their efforts behind closed doors. Saudi Arabia has pushed back against the recommendation that fossil fuels be urgently phased out of the energy sector. Instead, the kingdom is touting, thus enabling nations to continue burning fossil fuels by sucking the resulting emissions out of the atmosphere, according to Greenpeace, which obtained the documents. The kingdom repeatedly seeks to have the report’s authors delete references to the need to phase out fossil fuels, as well as the panel’s conclusion that there is a “need for urgent and accelerated mitigation actions at all scales”, according to the leaked documents Earlier this month, the United Arab Emirates — another major Gulf Arab energy producer — announced it too would join the “net zero” club of nations with a target to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The UAE did not announce specifics on how it will reach this target, but said its Ministry of Climate Change and Environment would work with the energy, economy, industry, infrastructure, transport, waste, agriculture and other sectors on the government’s strategies and policies to achieve net zero by 2050. The UAE says it is home to three of the largest solar facilities in the world and is the first country in the Middle East to deploy nuclear power.

" Seattle’s new Climate Pledge Arena is hardly subtle with its message.  Walk through the south entrance and visitors will see a one-story digital waterfall pouring through a forested scene above the atrium escalators. Some 8,500 plants from 24 species are displayed on a “living wall” along the new arena’s west concourse (the plants take root in recycled plastic and have their own team of horticulturist caretakers). Hockey players will skate on rainwater drained from the roof, filtered and then frozen to create the playing surface (a detail  almost every team representative is excited to share).   This 740,000-square-foot hockey palace — which aims to be the first net-zero carbon arena in the United States — is one of the most ambitious green building projects in the nation with a price tag of $1.15 billion. And neither the team’s executives   nor the building’s interior design  is shy about it. The goal: No fossil fuels (achieved), no single-use plastic by 2024 and little-to-no waste.  The Zambonis are electric, the cutlery is bamboo and the trash cans — yes, they still have them — are not long for the concourses if all goes according to plan.   On Wednesday, machinery purred and paintbrushes swished against the carpentry as workers put the finishing touches on the building, which is set to host the Seattle Kraken’s first home NHL game Saturday night. Kitchen equipment like fryers, held in port due to the global shipping crisis, still awaited installation. The arena’s climate promises, too, remain a work in progress. An offsite project to generate renewable energy, in partnership with the local utility, remains in the planning phase. Staffers are just beginning to calculate the cost — in emissions — of fans’ attendance and travel to games, which arena operators plan to cover by buying carbon offsets that invest in environmental projects. Team and arena executives hope their lofty ambitions and the attention they’re seeking to promote them will overcome skepticism and jump-start a green building movement at emissions-spewing stadiums across the country.  Buildings are responsible for roughly a third of U.S. emissions and prime targets for carbon reductions.  “It’s a moral imperative,” said Rob Johnson, the vice president of sustainability and transportation for the Seattle Kraken and the Climate Pledge Arena, adding that a full and transparent accounting of the arena’s carbon impacts will be public. “We hope that’s going to show cynics we really mean it.”  The idea to go carbon-neutral at  the arena started at the top — with the building’s roof. Designed for the 1962 World’s Fair, the roof once put a lid on KeyArena, which hosted the WNBA’s Seattle Storm and once featured the NBA’s SuperSonics. But by 2017, the city-owned building had begun to trend toward disrepair. Seattle put out a call for redevelopment bids amid public debate, seeking private money to spruce up the arena, lease the space and draw in new professional sports franchises. One complication: The roof, designated as a historical landmark, had to stay. Whoever took on the project would need to preserve 44 million pounds of sloping concrete and steel. And to accommodate modern professional sports, the relatively small arena would have to grow.  The solution — a privately-funded project led by the Oak View Group, a sports and entertainment development and management company — would require a feat of engineering.  Workers sliced through the concrete columns, holding the roof up by installing 72 temporary steel pillars.   “It was on stilts,” Ken Johnsen, the project’s construction manager, said.  Then, workers dug about 600,000 cubic yards of soil to expand the arena footprint before reconnecting the columns and building out its bowl.    New arena construction is among the most carbon intensive building projects, said Kate Simonen, a professor and chair of the department of architecture at the University of Washington, who was not involved in the project.  Holding a structure up and preserving lines of sight across a bowl require large spans, which  require more concrete and steel — more carbon.  “To reuse an existing facility is the first, best thing you can do from a material carbon perspective,” said Simonen, who also heads the Carbon Leadership Forum, a nonprofit group that aims to reduce embodied carbon in building materials. “The more we can do about evaluating and appreciating things that already exist, the better along we’ll be toward meeting climate goals.” According to Johnson, saving the historic roof preserved enough building material to construct an entire football stadium today. It also set the project on a path to try something novel.  A partnership with Amazon — a company with a self-reported yearly global carbon footprint roughly equivalent to nearly two-thirds the greenhouse gas emissions of Washington state, according to emissions tallies — pushed the arena’s green dreams further.  The Seattle-based company, which has been roiled by protests from environmental activists and criticism from employees over climate change, purchased the arena naming rights to promote its new public pledge to reach net-zero carbon by 2040.  The arena operators and Amazon decided the building ought to achieve that designation right away. Arena workers last spring scrapped plans to install natural gas for heating water, cooking and dehumidification of the rink, making it the first all-electric arena in North America, Johnson said.  Workers installed solar panels on the new atrium and a nearby garage, which will meet an estimated 3-5 3 percent to 5 percent of the building’s energy needs, according to Johnson.  The team purchased two lithium-ion powered Zambonis to resurface the ice, becoming the second NHL franchise with an electric ice resurfacing machine, according to Doug Peters, a Zamboni sales manager. A renewables project being planned by Seattle City Light will ultimately account for 100 percent of its remaining electrical use.  “We’re ensuring the building through time is going to remain zero carbon and we’re adding new renewable energy to the grid,” said Jason McLennan, a sustainability consultant who worked on the project.  The arena management group plans to file next October for zero-carbon certification from the International Living Future Institute, a sustainable building organization. A third-party auditor will verify whether it meets the requirements.  Some 37 percent of Seattle’s emissions come from building operations, according to an inventory of  its greenhouse gas sources.  KeyArena, the facility’s predecessor, was responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than any other city-owned building, said Sandra Mallory, of the city’s Office of Sustainability  and Environment. In its last full year of operation, the building ranked 111th-highest in greenhouse gas emissions among all Seattle buildings, according to city data.  “If you look at the building industry at large, we haven’t moved the needle fast enough,” McLennan said.  Local climate advocates, impressed with the building’s climate measures, hope it represents momentum.  “When I first heard about it, it seemed very symbolic, but when I learned more about their operation and building plans, it felt more significant,” said Deepa Sivarajan, the Washington policy manager of a Pacific Northwest nonprofit group called Climate Solutions. “We need all of our buildings to be getting to this place.“ Perhaps the most ambitious plan is for the arena to offset the impacts of its fans.  For every fan who attends a concert, hockey contest or basketball game, the arena will purchase carbon offsets to make up for their travel and the food they eat. Staffers will track and offset how food and merchandise arrive at the facility. The offsets will fund environmental projects designed to reduce emissions or remove carbon from the atmosphere.  The arithmetic remains a daunting task, Johnson said. The arena expects to host about 200 events a year with as many as 18,300 people in attendance. The arena operators will have to collect enough data — through fan surveys, parking lot counts and attendance information — to calculate the carbon cost of cheering on the teams. Each Seattle Kraken ticket includes a bus pass, which could help reduce the carbon cost of transportation.  Johnson said the organization does not have a budget or estimate for the cost of offsets. The group’s carbon accounting will be made public, he said. And about the arena’s in-your-face tone: He hopes it pushes people to reflect on their personal carbon footprint.

" WASHINGTON — Climate change poses a mounting threat to U.S. national security, with rising temperatures, droughts and extreme weather likely to trigger instability and conflict in developing countries, according to new reports from U.S. intelligence agencies, the White House and the Defense Department. The reports paint a dire picture of growing risks caused by radical changes in the world's climate as countries compete for dwindling water and food supplies while facing waves of migration across borders. The Biden administration released the reports as world leaders plan to meet in Glasgow, Scotland, next month for crucial talks to combat climate change. A new National Intelligence Estimate on climate, the first of its kind, warned that climate change would fuel global tensions, naming 11 countries that are especially at risk from climate change if trends continue: Afghanistan, Myanmar, India, Pakistan, North Korea, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Colombia and Iraq. ""We assess that climate change will increasingly exacerbate risks to U.S. national security interests as the physical impacts increase and geopolitical tensions mount about how to respond to the challenge,"" according to the National Intelligence Estimate issued by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. ""Intensifying physical effects will exacerbate geopolitical flashpoints, particularly after 2030, and key countries and regions will face increasing risks of instability and need for humanitarian assistance,"" it said. National Intelligence Estimates reflect a consensus of all of the country's intelligence agencies. Apart from the 11 countries cited, the intelligence report also said climate change was likely to ratchet up the risk of instability in Central Africa and small island states in the Pacific, which it said were ""two of the most vulnerable areas in the world."" A decline in revenue from oil and other fossil fuels is likely to further strain countries in the Middle East that are expected to suffer from extreme heat and longer droughts, the report said. Although the U.S. is in a relatively better position to respond to the effects of climate change, the report said ""the impacts will be massive even if the worst human costs can be avoided."" A Pentagon report said rising temperatures could aggravate factors that lead to migration and even cause governments to collapse. The report said that ""in worst-case scenarios, climate change-related impacts could stress economic and social conditions that contribute to mass migration events or political crises, civil unrest, shifts in the regional balance of power, or even state failure."" A White House report said migration fueled by climate change could put more pressure on America's allies and partners, as migrants are likely to seek refuge in democratic, stable countries that adhere to international conventions on asylum. The assessment also said Russia, China and other adversaries could seek to exploit the effects of climate change to drive migrants to the U.S. and U.S. allies. ""Climate change related migration could cause greater instability among U.S. allies/partners and thereby cause a relative strengthening in adversary states,"" said the White House report on the impact of climate change on migration. ""In addition, adversaries could incite or aid irregular migration to destabilize U.S. allies/partners,"" it said. Without an effective strategy from the U.S. and Europe, China, Russia and other governments could seek to gain influence by delivering support to countries struggling to address political unrest related to migration, it said. ""Russia also sees some benefits in the destabilizing effects of large-scale migration to the EU, particularly as it relates to the rise of xenophobia and political parties skeptical of the European project and the broader liberal order,"" the report said. Although Russia will face difficulties from climate change, including flooding and more forest fires, Moscow could benefit overall, as it will have more land opened up to cultivation and resource extraction, along with new sea routes in the Arctic that were previously inaccessible, according to the White House report. Over the past decade, U.S. intelligence agencies and senior military leaders have issued repeated warnings about the effect of climate change on global security, saying it could cause wars over water or other scarce resources.

" With President Joe Biden’s push to make climate change a priority in corner offices and on trading floors, the administration is arguing that climate change and extreme weather are incurring real — if not always well-quantified — economic cost. A big part of the problem, experts say, is that the very factors contributing to effects like a drier West and a soggier South also interfere with data scientists’ ability to put a price tag on environmental impact. Data about industrial output, worker demand, and productivity, inflation and earnings are critical inputs for all kinds of economic forecasts. But putting a dollar amount on the effects of climate change means figuring out how to measure it first and incorporate the cost of the changes that lie ahead. Because traditional economic calculus has no mechanism to do that, economists and analysts warn that the statistical foundation is increasingly at risk of distortion or unintentional misrepresentation. The insurance industry has been on the front lines of trying to price the risk of outcomes like drier farmland and higher water tables. While it is far from the only economic sector affected, the insurance industry has been on the front lines of trying to price the risk not only of natural disasters as they occur, but also of the creeping, long-term ramifications of outcomes like drier farmland and higher water tables over time. Insurance companies use reams of historical data to build predictive models that have been refined over years or even decades, said Cathy Seifert, an insurance analyst at CFRA Research. The problem is that today’s environment isn’t behaving like the environment of a generation ago, or even a decade ago, in some cases. “It’s important from a sector perspective and also from a geographic perspective ... and the data may not be there,” she said. Jared Dubrowsky, the vice president of the environmental practice at NFP, an insurance brokerage and consulting company, said, “We’re seeing more indirect things that pop up.” Risks are emerging in new places. For example, Dubrowsky said, rising sea levels are elevating water tables — along with long-submerged contaminants. “It’s starting to come up. We’re starting to see there may be vapor issues, there may be groundwater issues, and a lot of insurers are starting to get really nervous about that,” he said. Where and how to build are questions that affect sectors as diverse as housing and tourism, ones that companies are struggling to answer. “You’re starting to see mold issues arise in areas where it wasn’t an issue in the past,” Dubrowsky said. “Construction is built for the environment, and now the environment is changing.” In trying to predict the future, organizations concentrate on three categories, said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics: acute physical risk, such as flooding and power outages from hurricanes; chronic risk, such as land’s growing less arable over time; and transition risk, or how policy dictates the actions companies take and the costs those actions incur. The labor market — how many people are working, where they’re working and how well they’re working — is another topic about which economists have little to go on and high stakes to get right. “A good part of the adjustment they need to make, a big part of the impact climate risk is having on them, is how they manage their workforce,” Zandi said. “If you’re outside, heatstroke becomes a big issue. If you don’t mitigate the temperature, you will undermine productivity.” That has implications for all sorts of companies, like construction firms and cattle ranches, he said. Mark Hamrick, the chief financial analyst at Bankrate, said, “What we can assume, reasonably, is that climate change is impacting business operations.” But with no way to measure it, he warned, the mechanics of government remain exposed to potentially serious financial missteps. “It’s an increased risk for essentially the funding of, and the operation of, the federal government, because when we have multiple billion-dollar-plus events occurring on a regular basis, there are all kinds of responses required from the government,” Hamrick said. Seifert said: “From a government perspective, I don’t necessarily think there’s been a resource that totally encompasses all of this, and certainly not from the private sector. The level of detail needed to come up with a model that is both accurate and actionable is really an outsized effort, because there are so many components to climate change. It sort of gets tossed around as this issue, but when you actually try and dig into it, ‘multifaceted’ does not even begin to describe it. It’s kind of like a Pandora’s box.” It is a Pandora’s box that could well become a tinderbox, economists warn, if public- and private-sector economists alike are unable to develop data-modeling tools that can accurately reflect climate risk. “The only way to plan is to really run all these kinds of scenarios and try to plan for the worst case,” Zandi said. “It’s about scenario analytics and guarding against the downside. That’s a very difficult thing to do, and it’s very difficult to get right.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories. Martha C.

" The world needs to cut by more than half its production of coal, oil and gas in the coming decade to maintain a chance of keeping global warming from reaching dangerous levels, according to a U.N.-backed study released Wednesday. The report published by the U.N. Environment Program found that while governments have made ambitious pledges to curb greenhouse gas emissions, they are still planning to extract double the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than what would be consistent with the 2015 Paris climate accord’s goal of keeping the global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). Even the less ambitious goal of capping global warming at 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial times would be overshot, it said. Climate experts say the world must stop adding to the total amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere by 2050, and that can only be done by drastically reducing the burning of fossil fuels as soon as possible, among other measures. The report, which was released days before a U.N. climate summit begins Oct. 31 in Glasgow, found most major oil and gas producers — and even some major coal producers — are planning on increasing production until 2030 or even beyond. It also concluded that the group of 20 major industrialized and emerging economies have invested more into new fossil fuel projects than into clean energy since the start of 2020. The disparity between climate goals and fossil fuel extraction plans — termed the “production gap” — will widen until at least 2040, the report found. This would require increasingly steep and extreme measures to meet the Paris emissions goal, UNEP said. “There is still time to limit long term warming to 1.5°C, but this window of opportunity is rapidly closing,” said the agency’s executive director, Inger Andersen, adding that governments should commit to closing the gap at the Glasgow climate summit. The report, which had more than 40 researchers contributing, examine 15 major fossil fuel-producing countries. For the United States, they found that government projections show oil and gas production increasing to 17 percent and 12 percent, respectively, by 2030 compared to 2019 levels. Much of that would be exported, meaning the emissions from burning those fossil fuels would not show up in the U.S. inventory although they would add to the global total. U.S. coal production is projected to decline by 30 percent over the coming decade compared to 2019. Costa Rica’s environment and energy minister said the report shows the need to stop extracting fossil fuels to meet the Paris goals. “We must cut with both hands of the scissors, addressing demand and supply of fossil fuels simultaneously,” Andrea Meza said. Costa Rica and Denmark are planning to launch a new group at the Glasgow summit, the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, to promote that effort.

" LONDON — Celebrities joined Prince William in London on Sunday for the inaugural awards ceremony of his Earthshot Prize, an ambitious environmental program that aims to find new ideas and technologies around the world to tackle climate change and Earth’s most pressing challenges. The winners announced Sunday included the government of Costa Rica, which was honored for a project that pays local citizens to restore natural ecosystems, and the city of Milan, which was handed a prize for its Food Waste Hubs program, which recovers food from supermarkets and restaurants and distributes it to those in need. Actors Emma Thompson, Emma Watson and David Oyelowo joined William and Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, in handing out the awards at Alexandra Palace in north London. Guests were asked to “consider the environment when choosing their outfit,” and Watson arrived wearing a gown made from 10 wedding dresses from the charity Oxfam. Kate wore an Alexander McQueen dress made for her in 2011, while her husband wore a dark green velvet blazer and a polo neck. William and his charity, The Royal Foundation, launched the Earthshot Prize last year, inspired by President John F. Kennedy’s 1962 “Moonshot” speech that challenged and inspired Americans to go to the moon. The prize, to be awarded to five winners every year until 2030, is billed as the most prestigious of its kind. Each winner will receive a grant worth 1 million pounds ($1.4 million) to develop and scale up their ideas. “There’s been lots of amazing ideas over the past decades but it’s the implementation that really counts, so that’s what this is all about. So it’s really a reason to be cheerful,” Thompson said. The other winners were a land-based coral farm in the Bahamas to restore dying coral reefs; a green hydrogen technology developed to transform how homes and buildings are powered; and an India-based technology that creates fuel from agricultural waste in a bid to stop crop burning. William has said he wanted the initiative to inject some optimism into the climate debate, and on Sunday he urged young people not to give up hope for the future. “For too long, we haven’t done enough to protect the planet for your future. The Earthshot is for you,” he said. “In the next 10 years, we are going to act. We are going to find the solutions to repair our planet.” The United States will host next year’s award ceremony, he added. The ceremony came days ahead of the COP26 U.N. climate change summit in Glasgow, which begins Oct. 31. William, his father Prince Charles and Queen Elizabeth II are all expected to attend. Earlier this week William criticized the space race and space tourism, saying in an interview that the world’s greatest minds should be focused on repairing Earth instead of “trying to find the next place to go and live.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories."
" LOS ANGELES — Santa Monica resident Leonora Camner only has to open her windows to escape Southern California's worsening heat waves. Where millions of Los Angeles County residents must sit in a car for more than an hour to drive to the beach, Camner can get there in minutes. Coastal access is an equity issue, however, one that she said inspired her to join Abundant Housing LA, a nonprofit organization that advocates for solutions to the region’s affordable housing crisis. She is now the group's executive director. “I’m very fortunate to live in a place where we still have a cool breeze,” she said. “So many people work here in Santa Monica, but they are constantly having to leave because of the rising cost and lack of housing.” As home prices soar and wildfires rage across California, the state is increasingly confronted with the herculean task of addressing climate change while creating more affordable housing. A series of new mandates recently issued by Gov. Gavin Newsom has plunged the state deeper into what some say is an “existential” dilemma generations in the making: how to house the state’s 40 million residents while also protecting its natural resources. It’s a complicated task in a state where both homelessness and home prices are on the rise as climate change is fueling wildfires and drought. “It’s such an existential issue for a California facing climate change,” Camner said. “With these extreme fires, I don't see how we can ever address housing in a way that doesn't plan for that fact. There is no getting around it.” Last month, Newsom, a Democrat, signed more than two dozen housing bills aimed at spurring new development and addressing the state’s affordable housing shortage. He also approved a bill that curtails single-family zoning by allowing up to four units on single lots and another that encourages creating more housing density near transit and urban centers. Combined, the bills usher in a new era of growth for California at a time when millions of people struggle to afford rising rents and exclusive home pricing. Across the state, million-dollar houses have become the norm as the pandemic economy pushed an already competitive market into overdrive. While high earners scramble to outbid each other for single-family housing stock, renters are faced with an eviction moratorium that expired at the end of September. Intertwined with California’s housing shortage is climate change, which has contributed to severe drought, rising sea levels, historic wildfires and unprecedented heat waves. The state has already outlined a goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2045, a target that advocates say can be achieved in part by creating more housing near jobs and transportation centers and thereby eliminating hourslong commutes. At the center of the debate in Southern California is a yet-to-be completed tool that could bridge the gap between conservation and development. The SoCal Greenprint will be an interactive mapping platform providing access to more than 100 data sets that highlight natural resources. Inspired by similar projects around the country, the tool will include information on agricultural land, green spaces, habitats and biodiversity and clean water and air. The tool would be free for all users and would not constitute binding policy or regulation. “We feel very strongly that people want to come live in Southern California because of the environment, because of the nature of where we live,” said Kome Ajise, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, a metropolitan planning organization overseeing the development of the Greenprint. “You can go from the ocean to the mountains in a few hours, and there's some quality to that everybody felt we needed to preserve.” A sister tool is already being used in other parts of California. The Bay Area Greenprint was unveiled in 2017 and is actively updated with new information for real estate developers, city agencies and community organizations. It took less than two years to build, according to Liz O’Donoghue, director of Sustainable Development Strategy for the California Program at The Nature Conservancy, an international conservation organization that partnered with stakeholders to create the Greenprint. “It is really, really important at a time when we’re facing so many challenges and opportunities that we have the data available so that people can make the decisions they want to make,” she said. “Knowing where there are communities that don’t have a park close by … is really important to build knowledge and solve a number of the things we’re trying to solve,” O’Donoghue, who served as project lead on the Bay Area Greenprint, added. But in Southern California, where single-family zoning has long reigned supreme, the SoCal Greenprint has turned into a flashpoint. Last week, a public hearing on the future of the project devolved into a four-hour heated debate between those who want to see its immediate completion and opponents who worry it could stymie efforts to build more housing and transportation. Some went as far as to call the tool's implementation modern-day ""redlining,"" while others said it would be a ""betrayal"" to further delay the project. Ultimately, members of the Southern California Association of Governments voted to pause implementation of the SoCal Greenprint for future study and review. Chris Wilson, public policy manager for the Los Angeles County Business Federation, said the tool could have “unintended consequences” and affect some 4,000 transportation projects in the L.A region alone, including pausing construction because of environmental concerns revealed through the Greenprint. Wilson and his partners in the business community also worry about the potential for litigation as a result of the California Environmental Quality Act, a state law that requires local governments and public agencies to address the environmental impacts of major projects and land use decisions. Since being signed into law by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan in 1970, CEQA, as it’s colloquially known, has become “the environmental law developers love to hate.” “When you understand the SoCal Greenprint, yes it is about housing, but there is also a spillover to the transportation and goods movement sector,” Wilson said. “These are things we want to make sure SCAG is aware of so there are no unintended consequences.” Culver City Mayor Alex Fisch said he was “shocked” by the contentious public hearing last week and called the Greenprint a “tremendously helpful tool.” But he also sees it as a symbol of the inherent tension between conservation and development. “The concern that people have is that when you look honestly at the environmental impact of building on the urban fringe, it’s terrible,” he said. “It is just a map, but it’s a proxy for so much more.” Breaking news emails Be the first to know about breaking news and other NBC News reports.

" WASHTINGTON — The Biden administration is taking steps to address the economic risks from climate change, issuing a 40-page report Friday on government-wide plans to protect the financial, insurance and housing markets and the savings of American families. The report lays out steps that could potentially alter the mortgage process, stock market disclosures, retirement plans, federal procurement and government budgeting. It’s a follow-up to a May executive order by President Joe Biden that essentially calls on the government to analyze how the world’s largest economy could be affected by extreme heat, flooding, storms, wildfires and the broader adjustments needed to address climate change. “If this year has shown us anything, it’s that climate change poses an ongoing urgent and systemic risk to our economy and to the lives and livelihoods of everyday Americans, and we must act now,” Gina McCarthy, the White House national climate adviser, told reporters. A February storm in Texas led to widespread power outages, 210 deaths and severe property damage. Wildfires raged in Western states. The heat dome in the Pacific Northwest caused record temperatures in Seattle and Portland, Oregon. Hurricane Ida struck Louisiana in August and caused deadly flooding in the Northeast. The actions being recommended by the Biden administration reflect a significant shift in the broader discussion about climate change, suggesting that the nation must prepare for the costs that families, investors and governments will bear. The report is also an effort to showcase to the world how serious the U.S. government is about tackling climate change ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference running from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12 in Glasgow, Scotland. Among the steps outlined is the government’s Financial Stability Oversight Council developing the tools to identify and lessen climate-related risks to the economy. The Treasury Department plans to address the risks to the insurance sector and availability of coverage. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at mandatory disclosure rules about the opportunities and risks generated by climate change. The Labor Department on Wednesday proposed a rule for investment managers to factor environmental decisions into the choices made for pensions and retirement savings. The Office of Management and Budget announced the government will begin the process of asking federal agencies to consider greenhouse gas emissions from the companies providing supplies. Biden’s budget proposal for fiscal 2023 will feature an assessment of climate risks. Federal agencies involved in lending and mortgages for homes are looking for the impact on the housing market, with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and its partners developing disclosures for homebuyers and flood and climate-related risks. The Department of Veterans Affairs will also look at climate risks for its home lending program. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is updating the standards for its National Flood Insurance Program, potentially revising guidelines that go back to 1976. “We now do recognize that climate change is a systemic risk,” McCarthy said. “We have to look fundamentally at the way the federal government does its job and how we look at the finance system and its stability.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories."
" For the second straight year, the world heads into a new La Nina weather event. This would tend to dry out parts of an already parched and fiery American West and boost an already busy Atlantic hurricane season. Just five months after the end of a La Nina that started in September 2020, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced a new cooling of the Pacific is underway. La Nina’s natural cooling of parts of the Pacific is the flip side of a warmer El Nino pattern and sets in motion changes to the world’s weather for months and sometimes years. But the changes vary from place to place and aren’t certainties, just tendencies. La Ninas tend to cause more agricultural and drought damage to the United States than El Ninos and neutral conditions, according to a 1999 study. That study found La Ninas in general cause $2.2 billion to $6.5 billion in damage to the U.S. agriculture. There’s a 57 percent chance this will be a moderate La Nina and only 15 percent that it will be strong, said Mike Halpert, deputy director of NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. He said it is unlikely to be as strong as last year’s because the second year of back-to-back La Ninas usually doesn’t quite measure up to the first. This La Nina is expected to stretch through spring, Halpert said. For the entire southern one-third of the country and especially the Southwest, a La Nina often means drier and warmer weather. The West has been experiencing a two decade-plus megadrought that’s worsened the last couple of years. But for the Northwest — Washington, Oregon, maybe parts of Idaho and Montana — La Nina means a good chance rain and drought relief, Halpert said. “Good for them, probably not so good for central, southern California,” Halpert said. The Ohio Valley and Northern Plains could be wetter and cooler. La Nina winters also tend to shift snow storms more northerly in winter while places like the mid-Atlantic often don’t get blockbuster snowstorms. During last year’s La Nina, the Atlantic set a record with 30 named storms. This year, without La Nina, the season has still been busier than normal with 20 named storms and only one name left unused on the primary storm name list: Wanda. The last couple weeks have been quiet but “I expect it to pick up again,” Halpert said. “Just because it’s quiet now, it doesn’t mean we won’t still see more storms as we get later into October and even into November.” La Ninas tend to make Atlantic seasons more active because one key ingredient in formation of storms is winds near the top of them. An El Nino triggers more crosswinds that decapitate storms, while a La Nina has fewer crosswinds, allowing storms to develop and grow. Much of both southeast Asia and northern Australia are wetter in La Nina — and that’s already apparent in Indonesia, Halpert said. Central Africa and southeast China tend to be drier. Expect it to be cooler in western Canada, southern Alaska, Japan, the Korean peninsula, western Africa and southeastern Brazil. Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories."
" LONDON — Prince William delivered an apparent jab at the billionaire space race Thursday, saying the world's greatest minds should be more focused on saving Earth than looking beyond our planet's horizons. In an interview with the BBC that aired early Thursday, the Duke of Cambridge warned of a ""rise in climate anxiety"" among young people around the world whose ""futures are basically threatened"" by the climate crisis. ""We need some of the world’s greatest brains and minds fixed on trying to repair this planet, not trying to find the next place to go and live,"" William, 39, said. A spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge told NBC News they had nothing more to add. The royal's comments came just a day after ""Star Trek"" actor William Shatner became the oldest person to go to space, traveling aboard the Blue Origin rocket and capsule developed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Shatner said Thursday the trip reinforced his conviction that people need to take better care of the planet. “It’s so fragile,” Shatner, who played Capt. James T. Kirk in the original series of “Star Trek,” said exclusively on NBC’s “TODAY” show. “The fragility of this planet — the coming catastrophic event, and we all need to clean this act up now,” he added. The actor previously brushed off concerns about billionaires like Bezos, Elon Musk and British mogul Richard Branson using their riches to invest in commercial space travel rather than investing in social causes. ""It's their money,"" he told NBC News in an interview in July. ""They can do what they want with it."" Bezos, the world's richest man, described his own inaugural spaceflight as part of building a road to space “so that our kids and their kids can build a future.” “We need to do that to solve the problems here on Earth,” he said in July. But William urged a more grounded approach. It is ""crucial to be focusing on this [planet] rather than giving up and heading out into space to try and think of solutions for the future,"" he told the BBC. William has pursued an active environmental agenda as part of his royal duties, as have other members of the royal family. His father, Prince Charles, has done decades of environmental work. “It’s been a hard road for him. He’s had a really rough ride on that, and I think he’s been proven to being well ahead of the curve,” William told the BBC. The duke said it would be an “absolute disaster” if his own son, Prince George, “sat here talking” about saving the planet in 30 years’ time. William created the Earthshot Prize, which aims to find solutions to the planet's problems through new technologies or policies. The first five winners, who will each collect $1.4 million, will be announced at a ceremony Sunday. The interview also comes as world leaders prepare to gather in Glasgow, Scotland, at the end of the month for COP26, the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference. Queen Elizabeth and other royals will attend the summit, which has been billed as make-or-break for the global climate fight. ""We can’t have more clever speak, clever words but not enough action,"" William said. But U.S. climate envoy John Kerry has tempered expectations for the conference, conceding in an interview with The Associated Press published Thursday that the talks will likely end with nations still short of their targets for emissions cuts.

" LONDON — Adapt or die. This is the stark warning England’s environment agency issued Wednesday as it urged the country to change in order to cope with flooding, droughts and other extreme weather events brought on by climate change. The message comes after summer flooding, which scientists said was made more likely by climate change, killed 200 people in Western Europe, and ahead of a key international environment conference in Glasgow, Scotland. ""It is adapt or die,"" the agency’s chair Emma Howard Boyd said in a statement. ""While mitigation might save the planet, it is adaptation, preparing for climate shocks, that will save millions of lives."" Making places where people live, work and travel resilient to the effects of extreme weather can minimize death and destruction that the climate crisis is already wreaking, the agency said. It’s also much cheaper to invest in climate resilience early than deal with the aftermath of climate change impacts when it's too late, it added. The report warned of increased flooding and drought, rising sea levels and greater demand on water as the result of global warming. It noted that London’s sea level was expected to rise dramatically — by as much as 9 inches by the 2050s, and nearly 18 inches by the 2080s. England could face the type of flooding that killed 200 people in Western Europe this summer when rivers in Germany and Belgium overflowed their banks after heavy rains, Howard Boyd warned. A recent study by the World Weather Attribution initiative, an international group of scientists that analyses extreme weather events around the world, found that climate change makes such deadly events up to 9 times more likely.  ""That will happen in this country sooner or later, however high we build our flood defenses, unless we also make the places where we live, work and travel resilient to the effects of the more violent weather the climate emergency is bringing,"" Howard Boyd said. The agency said new flood and coastal defense systems were vital to adapting to the changing climate. It also called for projects to restore natural ecosystems that hold back rainwater and absorb carbon at the same time.  In addition, it said water companies will need to plan for water shortages, and more needs to be done to attract private funding to invest in flood defense projects. Sam Fankhauser, professor of climate change economics and policy at Oxford University, said the agency was right to issue the severe warnings. ""Heat waves and floods do kill, and they are sources of immense trauma and destruction,"" he said. ""They don’t have to be, if we prepare well, so the agency is absolutely right to emphasize the importance of adapting to increased climate risks,"" he said. ""Adaptation gets less attention than reducing emissions, but they are really two sides of the same coin."" The environment agency’s report comes just weeks before the U.K. is scheduled to host the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, widely seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control, where helping communities adapt to climate change is one of four goals outlined by summit officials. The adaptation measures on the COP26 agenda include more funding to improve early warning systems and flood defenses worldwide, and measures to protect and restore habitats to provide natural storm and flood defenses. The U.K. Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs told NBC News in an email in response to the environment agency report that it's taking ""robust action"" to improve resilience to climate change across the whole country. In August, the United Nations warned that climate change was changing the Earth in ways that are “unprecedented” in thousands of years — and in some cases, hundreds of thousands of years. For the first time, it provided a more detailed regional assessment of climate change, including a focus on risk assessment and adaptation.

" This article was published in partnership with Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, independent news outlet that covers climate, energy and the environment. An unusually harsh downpour that was probably supercharged by climate change swelled the Sagavanirktok River in the Brooks Range of northern Alaska in the late summer of 2019. Chunks of earth crumpled into the churning water in August as the river chewed away 100 feet of the land on the west side of the Sag, as the river is commonly called, reaching within 30 feet of a buried segment of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The 4-foot-diameter pipe carries an average of 20 million gallons of crude oil a day from the Prudhoe Bay oil fields, and if floodwaters reached a buried section of pipeline at full strength, the force would buffet the pipe like waves slapping a sailboat on stormy seas. Rushing water could scour away the ground supporting the buried pipeline, leaving it hanging unsupported and vulnerable to collapse, while above-ground sections of the pipe could be weakened if water washed away the earth anchoring its support structures. “Unlike hazardous liquid releases on land where it can be easier to respond to and contain spills, swift-moving river currents will carry hazardous liquids further downstream, potentially impacting much larger geographical areas and more communities,” the Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the federal agency responsible for enforcing pipeline safety, told pipeline operators in a 2019 bulletin.  Two months after the flood, the close call prompted the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., a syndicate of oil companies that owns and operates the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, or TAPS, to seek authorization from the Alaska Department of Natural Resources to fortify the banks of the Sag to protect the pipeline from floodwaters.  But since then, the flood threat has grown, which spurred Alyeska to seek additional authorization last year to build three massive flood control walls along other sections of the river “to protect TAPS from current and future flood events.” The increasing urgency to fortify sections of pipeline against thrashing floodwaters foreshadows what scientists, pipeline consultants and environmental advocates say is a future in which infrastructure like the Trans-Alaska Pipeline will face increasing assaults driven by the warming climate, including floods, wildfires, thawing permafrost and rising sea levels. Mitigation measures need to be charted into the future, they say, rather than applied like Band-Aids as the damage materializes. Flooding along the 800 miles of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline has intensified as rising temperatures hasten snowmelt and amplify rainfall surges. Rivers paralleling the pipeline are reaching higher levels for longer periods, increasing their potential to wash out the pipeline and touching off frantic fights to prevent their churning waters from reaching it. “What we are seeing now are changes in terms of higher river [flow] peaks, the duration of flooding and the seasonality,” said geomorphologist and river science consultant Karin Boyd, the owner of Applied Geomorphology Inc. of Montana. “This raises the question of ‘Do we need to look very carefully at whether the pipeline is more exposed now than it has been before?’” The flooding in 2019 was just the beginning of a series of close calls. The surging waters began in March, when Alyeska confronted flooding on the Lowe River near the pipeline’s terminus in Valdez. The river had steadily eroded 300 feet of bank in the direction of a section of the buried pipeline, generating a request by Alyeska to add a wall of riprap — a combination of rock and gravel — to “mitigate further erosion and exposure of the pipeline.” Then, in May, Alyeska found itself in a pitched battle for five days to save the pipeline from the Dietrich River. As the heat accelerated snowmelt from the Brooks Range, the river overflowed and surged toward an elevated section of the pipeline 37 miles north of Coldfoot, a truck stop along the Dalton Highway. Records filed with the state’s oil and gas division describe the tense fight early on to protect the pipeline against “aggressive bank erosion” that brought the heaving river to within 80 feet — less than the length of a basketball court — of supports holding up an above-ground section of the pipeline. Temperatures jumped above average for 15 days from May 15 to June 1, some days soaring as high as 13 degrees above normal, according to data assembled by the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy.  Alyeska, an association of oil companies that includes a subsidiary of Hilcorp Energy Co., as well as ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil, responded to the “aggressive nature of the bank erosion and continued high flows” by placing riprap between the river and the pipeline, eventually increasing the pile to 185 feet in length. A few days later, about 600 more cubic yards of material — 200 feet long by 30 to 40 feet wide — were added to the existing barrier to stabilize about 400 feet of the water’s edge where the river was undercutting the bank.   The all-hands defense prevailed. But the fight wasn’t over. A July 2019 heat wave of “astonishing intensity” unleashed record temperatures into the 80s and 90s across Alaska. Then, in August, rain gauges registered 171 percent higher precipitation than the 30-year average when the downpours hit the headwaters of the Sagavanirktok. The usual rainfall total for the region is about 3 inches for the month; it more than doubled that fall in 2019.  The summer deluge fits the long-term pattern of increasing rain in the central and eastern regions of Alaska’s North Slope, which today get 15 percent to 35 percent more precipitation than they did in the early 1970s, according to records kept by the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. Such downpours are increasingly being fueled by evaporative moisture from the warming of the Bering Sea, said Rick Thoman, an Alaska climate specialist with the climate assessment center. The added moisture in the atmosphere supercharges the traditional summer storms along the North Slope.  “It’s important not just to look at how high the river got but consider the significance of the causative effect,” he said. “This was the result of approximately a single rainstorm.” In June 2020, Alyeska again found itself where it began in 2019: scrambling to protect a section of pipeline buried 10 feet deep when the Lowe River roared to life and flooded near Valdez, eroding a 100-foot buffer between the riverbank and the pipeline. The company brought in heavy machinery to place up to 2,000 cubic yards of riprap to fortify 300 feet of the eroded bank.  The fight prevented the Lowe River from washing out the pipeline, but it and other recent battles to hold back surging rivers reflect the increasing peril environmental activists say the pipeline is facing from floods. Alyeska spokeswoman Michelle Egan declined to answer specific questions about floods that have threatened the pipeline or the organization’s overall flood mitigation plan. She said in a statement that the pipeline was constructed and maintained in consideration of Alaska’s “unique” environment and that Alyeska has an integrity management program that includes a team of engineers who specialize in monitoring rivers and flood plains.  “The program monitors stream crossings and flood plains along the route of the pipeline,” Egan said. “Flow rates and water levels traditionally shift and vary. We collect, store and analyze data for trends to proactively protect the pipeline.”  Over the years, Alyeska has taken additional measures to protect the pipeline from flooding by constructing simple earthen dams nearby or surrounding the pipe with wire cages filled with heavy rocks. But new climate threats are challenging the old design standards that have kept the pipeline safe for decades. Along with the certainty of more deluges, the floods in the last two years have led Alyeska to seek approval from the state to construct barriers to fortify vulnerable sections of the pipeline along its entire north-to-south route. Alyeska sought permission in May 2020 from the state Department of Natural Resources to stockpile 200,000 cubic yards of gravel, sand and rocks to be used to construct emergency barriers along a 67-mile section of the river above the Arctic Circle should it surge toward the pipeline again. In addition to emergency preparations, Alyeska has blueprints pending with the state to build three other large, permanent flood control measures on the Sag. Since 2019, Alyeska has sought permission to construct five flood control projects on the river. The projects in the past two years account for nearly half of all flood control projects on the Sag since 2000. In one proposal approved this year, the company sought to erect a spur dike 355 feet long by 170 feet wide, covering 1.4 acres, to deflect the river from the pipeline at a point 22 miles from its starting point in Prudhoe Bay. According to Alyeska’s project application with the state, the work became crucial after the 2019 flooding on the Sag shifted the river channel toward the pipeline. Officials in the Oil and Gas Division of the Department of Natural Resources, the agency responsible for permitting pipelines on state land, say Alyeska’s series of mitigation projects should not be taken as cause for alarm but rather as an example of its determination to safeguard the pipeline. The agency described the multiple projects to repair or improve river diversion structures as “minor.” Yet the state has not conducted or required migration mapping to identify where the course of the Sag and other rivers may have changed in ways that could affect the pipeline. As part of its property lease agreement with the state for the pipeline right of way, Alyeska was required to submit detailed descriptions of its strategy to monitor and maintain the pipeline where it runs along flood plains or crosses rivers. The records, however, are protected by confidentiality provisions that block public review. The agency does not analyze climate trends or coordinate with Alyeska or other pipeline operators in planning for future flooding. “Prudent operators prepare for all kinds of low-probability, high-cost events as a matter of good business,” said Sean Clifton, a spokesman for Tony Strupulis, the agency’s pipeline coordinator. The Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the federal agency that enforces pipeline safety, acknowledged the recent uptick in flooding along the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, but it stopped short of saying the pattern was cause for concern or required any out-of-the-ordinary response. “It’s important to remember that rivers in Alaska have been known to be susceptible to erosion and rapid change with weather cycles like we’re having now for as long as humans have attempted to map the state,” Clifton said. “It’s an ongoing engineering problem that the pipeline operator will continue to address, just as they have been doing for 44 years.” Federal regulations require that all pipelines in the U.S. have their rights of way inspected at least 26 times a year, at intervals not exceeding three weeks. In most circumstances, that should give an operator enough time to detect a pipeline threat, said Rebecca Craven, the program director for the Pipeline Safety Trust, a nonprofit watchdog organization. “But in a situation like TAPS, where it runs so close to rivers that can change very quickly, depending on snowmelt, precipitation and temperature, it may be that a whole lot of change could occur in three weeks,” she said. The other relevant regulations, the integrity management rules, apply only to areas where breaks in the pipe could affect “high consequence areas” — areas deemed to deserve a higher measure of protection against damage from pipeline failures. But they remain cloaked in confidentiality, like Alyeska’s plans filed with the state. Because the areas are secret, public officials, tribal governments and landowners have no idea whether Alyeska has overlooked some important information with which only locals have historical familiarity, she said. “So there is a twofold benefit to making that information available,” Craven said. “It helps the operator and regulators by ensuring a robust identification of areas of high consequence, and it builds trust with the public that the operator has identified and is properly mitigating against threats to the pipeline.” Breaking news emails Be the first to know about breaking news and other NBC News reports."
" VATICAN CITY — The Vatican hopes a meeting where world religious leaders will take a common stand on the environment can ""raise ambitions"" on what can be achieved at next month's U.N. Climate Change Conference, its foreign minister says. Monday's day-long event, organized by the Vatican, the United Kingdom and Italy, brings together about 40 faith leaders of the world's major religions and scientists, from about 20 countries. The leaders, including Pope Francis, will sign a joint appeal and hand it to Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio and Britain's Alok Sharma, president of the U.N. gathering known as COP26 in Glasgow. ""It is our hope that (the Monday meeting) will give an impact to opinion in general but within our faith groups and faith families and also within the political community to raise ambitions with regards to what can be achieved by COP26,"" said Archbishop Paul Gallagher. Speaking in a telephone interview with Reuters on Sunday, Gallagher said the Vatican hoped the direct appeal to COP26 leaders would have the same effect as the pope's landmark 2015 environmental encyclical ""Laudato Si"" (Praised Be). It drew massive attention to climate crisis and spurred activism by faith groups. ""Most of the religions represented, whether it's through their sacred scriptures or their traditions or the spirituality that they represent, have the basis for a renewal of our relationship with the environment and with the planet,"" Gallagher said. The meeting is called ""Faith and Science: Towards COP26."" It brings together Christian leaders, including the pope, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and the Orthodox ecumenical patriarch Bartholomew, as well as representatives of Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Zoroastrianism and Jainism. The pope, Welby and Bartholomew issued a joint appeal to members of their Churches last month to ""listen to the cry of the earth."" Scotland's bishops said in July that the pope will attend the opening of COP26, health permitting. A decision is expected in the next few days. Francis strongly supports the goals of the 2015 U.N. Paris accord to reduce global warming. Over the weekend, he told young people that theirs was ""perhaps the last generation"" to save the planet. Gallagher, who is British, said it was ""a sign of great hope"" that President Joe Biden returned the United States to the Paris accords after his predecessor Donald Trump pulled out. Biden and the pope are expected to meet at the Vatican at the end of October. ""Translating commitment into action is the great problem and we all know that our political leaders are very good at promising and very good at talking but the action that we need now is urgent and it is enormous,"" he said. He said the Vatican hoped Monday's conference would underscore the need for ""an ecological conversion in the way we relate to the planet"", and the realization that lifestyle changes would be necessary but not easy. ""Most aspects of life have a political dimension and if you are going to say that faith should also be part of every part of your life then obviously your faith is going to affect your politics,"" Gallagher said. He said organizers did not consider inviting the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet's Buddhists, who is not recognized by China. ""His Holiness the Dalai Lama knows how well he is respected here by the Holy See but he also appreciates that our relations (with China) are complicated and difficult and he has always respected that and we appreciate that very much and so the dialogue goes on with Buddhism on many, many levels,"" he said.

" BRASILIA — Protecting the native inhabitants of the Amazon and their right to ancestral lands is crucial to saving the rainforest because they are its best guardians, environmental activists said on Monday. But their rights to protected lands are being undermined by the far-right government of President Jair Bolsonaro, they said on a panel at the  Reuters Impact conference on the fate of the Amazon rainforest. “What we are seeing is an attack on Indigenous people, on their rights, their lives and territories,” said Leila Salazar-Lopez, executive director of Amazon Watch. Ginger Cassady, executive director of the Rainforest Action Network, said the actions of the Bolsonaro government have continued to increase deforestation by dismantling environmental protections despite its promises. Deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon has risen sharply since Bolsonaro took office in 2019. Although preliminary data suggest clearing so far this year is little changed from last year, destruction remains at a level not seen in Brazil since 2008.  After years of funding cuts and hiring freezes, Bolsonaro promised to double resources for environmental enforcement to combat illegal deforestation at a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in September.  Both activists urged banks and other investors to respect Indigenous land rights and native communities’ prior consent to projects that impact their lands. They called on the private sector to stop the expansion of oil concessions in the Amazon, the world’s largest rainforest and a vital bulwark against climate change. Salazar-Lopez said forests were being cut down intentionally to clear land for cattle grazing and soy plantations, while the gutting of the government’s Indigenous affairs agency Funai under Bolsonaro has left Indigenous reservations unprotected and vulnerable to illegal logging and gold miners. “Indigenous people are the best protectors of the Amazon forest and of biodiversity around our planet ... because they have intrinsic spiritual and cultural connections to the land,” Salazar-Lopez said. “They have the most to lose and so they will do anything to protect the land, which is everything to them,” she said. Indigenous territories, which account for about 30 percent of the Amazon, are among the best protected lands in the region, and another 20 percent are protected areas under the care of the federal government.

" This story was published in partnership with Covering Climate Now, a global journalism collaboration strengthening coverage of the climate story. The author is Covering Climate Now’s deputy director. Growing up in southern West Virginia, Jacob Hannah was always of two minds about coal. His father and grandfather were coal miners. Coal meant a roof over their heads and a tie to bind the small community of Wilsondale that they called home. People there found purpose in coal, proud to know their work was helping power the nation. But Hannah, 29, also saw neighbors who grappled with nasty illnesses: bronchitis, black lung and cancer. Worksite injuries were a constant. And he began to hear more news about climate change and the role that coal and other fossil fuels played. “The coal economy is a sinking ship,” he said, “but it’s difficult for anyone who grew up in Appalachia not to feel a sense of defensiveness and protectiveness towards coal.” Hannah is a conservation coordinator for Coalfield Development, a nonprofit group working to revitalize West Virginia, in part through clean energy. The organization recently put in place the state’s largest nonprofit solar installation. He’s proud of his family’s legacy but traveling around the state and taking stock of shuttered storefronts and scarred land have convinced him that the need for change is clear.  “We need an antidote,” he said. “We need medicine to strengthen our communities.” At a time when U.S. leaders are finally moving to address climate change, it’s fitting that a state long at center stage in America’s resource-extraction economy would hold the spotlight. Since the start of Joe Biden’s presidency, all eyes have been on Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., whose vote in an evenly divided Senate positions him as a linchpin in the federal climate agenda. Prior to entering politics, Manchin founded and ran the coal-brokerage firm Enersystems. He handed the company to his son upon being elected West Virginia’s secretary of state in 2000 — he served later as governor, before joining the U.S. Senate in 2010 — but retained millions in company stocks. According to the senator’s financial disclosures, Manchin continues to earn hundreds of thousands each year from the sale of coal. To date, the centrist Democrat has been critical of the action that scientists around the world agree is necessary to avoid the worst of the climate emergency. He argues that a rapid move toward clean energy could sound the death knell for communities already suffering from fossil fuels’ decline. In Manchin’s home state, however, some say change can’t come soon enough. Coal remains a backbone of some West Virginia communities. But with a nationwide shift toward renewables underway, many West Virginians are eager to secure a place for the state in America’s clean energy future. “For a long time, the culture here has been, ‘What’s good for coal is good for West Virginia,’” said James Van Nostrand, director of the Center for Energy and Sustainable Development at the West Virginia University College of Law. “But that hasn’t been true for 10 years, or decades longer.” In the mid-1900s, coal employed more than 100,000 people in the Mountain State. Over the years, new technology enabled companies to mine more with fewer workers. Then, beginning in the mid-2000s, the shale revolution saw natural gas challenge and ultimately, in 2016, replace coal as America’s leading energy source for electricity production. In 2019, the last year for which data is available from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, coal employment in West Virginia was down to roughly 14,000. Throughout this decline, poverty spiked, placing West Virginia consistently among the poorest states in the country. The state has also come to lead the nation in population decline, with young West Virginians increasingly leaving to find gainful employment. A grim joke in the state goes that people have overtaken coal as West Virginia’s top export. In a state prized for its natural beauty, the environmental situation is no better. Abandoned mines and thousands of uncapped oil and gas wells pollute local air and water. Mountaintop removal, a mining practice that involves deforesting mountain peaks and then blasting them out of existence to get at coal underneath, continues to cover surrounding areas in hazardous dust.  Health impacts are widespread, and in Charleston, the state capital, deregulation is standard. Many political leaders in West Virginia have direct ties to the coal industry, including Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican and a billionaire who owns multiple coal companies and, in his official capacity, oversees the state regulatory arms meant to hold those companies accountable. “It’s not uncommon for me to turn on the tap water, and it’s brown,” said Angie Rosser, director of the environmental nonprofit West Virginia Rivers Coalition. “That’s normal in many parts of West Virginia. Some of us don’t remember ever having safe water.” Further emphasizing West Virginia’s legacy as a fossil fuel producer, climate change is also taking a toll.  Rosser, like many West Virginians, lives near a river. In June 2016, torrential rains filled the Elk River outside her home, triggering a flash flood. That day, floods killed 23 people and devastated much of central West Virginia. She said her town, Clendenin, hasn’t been the same since. “People have left,"" she said. ""There are abandoned houses. We still don’t have a grocery store.” Scientists called the flooding a “thousand-year event” but only a preview of what climate change might have in store for West Virginia. As global heating progresses, the Appalachian region is projected to become significantly wetter, with heavier rainfall making floods both more likely and more dangerous. Traditionally, climate change has been a near-verboten subject in her state, Rosser said. The implicit threat to coal was always one thing. In a deeply conservative state, the politicization of climate change was another. A 2020 study by Yale University and George Mason University showed that fewer people in West Virginia believed climate change was occurring than in any other state — 59 percent of adults compared with 72 percent nationwide. Affinities toward coal notwithstanding, she said it’s clear that West Virginians’ foremost loyalties lie with their families and preserving the state as a safe and prosperous place to call home. “I’m hearing more conversations acknowledging that coal isn’t coming back,” Rosser said. “There’s a lot of fear and anxiety actually that maybe we waited too long.” Increasingly, a transition away from coal might be a conversation some West Virginians are willing to entertain. Along with other local nonprofit group, Rosser’s organization recently produced a “Citizens Guide to Climate Change.” Written “by West Virginians, for West Virginians,” she said, the guide aims to push climate discourse in the state forward, unpacking the causes and impacts of climate change from a local perspective and laying out a menu of potential solutions, such as a Green New Deal, enhanced emissions regulations and a carbon tax. Rosser expected skepticism, but responses to the guide have been positive, she said. Especially resonant is the goal of a “just transition,” which suggests that, although fossil fuels are very much to blame for climate change, a special debt is owed to fossil fuel workers, as the nation shifts to new sources of energy.  “We put in the work to lift America into an industrialized power, through the use of coal,” Rosser explained. “Now, we deserve reinvestment.” And West Virginia is ripe for reinvestment, according to Jeremy Richardson, a native West Virginian and a senior analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists’ Climate and Energy program. There is “plenty of untapped potential,” he said, to create jobs as an “off-ramp” for current and former coal workers — first, in reclaiming and restoring land damaged by fossil fuel exploitation and, second, in domestic manufacturing of clean energy components, such as windmill blades and parts for solar panels. West Virginia is also well-suited to wind and solar energy production. Clean energy is unlikely to replace every coal and fossil fuel job lost in West Virginia, he added. But it can help begin to diversify the state’s economy. It will also make West Virginia more attractive to outside industries and companies, such as car manufacturers — which increasingly have made their own climate commitments and, thus, are unlikely to invest where clean energy is scarce — sparking further economic development. “West Virginia is behind the eight ball, because we haven’t done a lot by way of developing and deploying clean energy,” Richardson said. “We really need to go far fast.” Whether West Virginians will reap the benefits of clean energy opportunities depends in large part on the state’s leaders in both Charleston and Washington, said Van Nostrand, of West Virginia University. In this regard, there have been halting gestures toward sustainability, he added, but the state lags behind most others, as well as the latest climate science. In August, a landmark United Nations report warned that the consequences of climate change, including the extreme weather wreaking havoc already, will grow dramatically worse this century if humanity fails to rein in emissions. Also critical: making sure climate action reaches communities of color in West Virginia. The state is more than 90 percent white, but African Americans nevertheless comprised a substantial portion of the coal labor force, said Pam Nixon, a community organizer with the Charleston, West Virginia, chapter of the NAACP. As technology in the industry progressed, though, Black workers typically weren’t selected for training opportunities; when layoffs became commonplace, they were far more likely than their white peers to be let go. “When Manchin and others talk about not leaving coal workers behind, they don’t usually acknowledge that Black coal workers were left behind years ago,” she said. “We need to make sure this trend doesn’t continue. Blacks and Latinos in West Virginia, we need to be sitting at the table.” Manchin, who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, was instrumental to the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package, passed in August by the Senate and pending House approval. That bill includes some $120 billion for clean energy and climate resilience projects, as well as $21 billion to clean up abandoned mines and cap leaking oil and gas wells. Experts say these provisions can be a boon for West Virginia, but they’ll fall short of meeting the needs of the state. At the national level, climate scientist Michael E. Mann called the bill “a far cry from meeting the moment,” arguing that it does nothing to reduce America’s reliance on fossil fuels. A separate, larger bill, hailed as the most comprehensive climate legislation in U.S. history, promises more robust investments in renewables. But Manchin has said he opposes the measure, citing its $3.5 trillion price tag.  Manchin’s Senate office did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Unwilling to wait, some in the senator’s state are taking matters into their own hands. This summer, West Virginia environmental groups banded together, traveling to six communities in the state as part of the “Democracy, Jobs, and Care-a-van Summer Jam.” They offered live music, free food, prayer and a message about clean energy.  “The best way to honor West Virginians as energy producers is to bring them into what clean energy looks like today,” said Morgan Sell, an organizer with the West Virginia Working Families Party and president of the Eastern Panhandle Green Coalition. Sell said she found people receptive, even those with politics different from her own. But many were also angry at the pain and poverty their communities had been asked to endure. “When you talk about clean energy or something like manufacturing electric vehicles, West Virginians are extremely interested,” she said. “But politicians aren’t having these conversations with us. Instead, they make assumptions about what we want.” Indeed, a June poll by Data for Progress and the Chesapeake Climate Action Fund found that a clear majority of West Virginians, 56 percent, support a clean electricity transition by 2035, while only 36 percent oppose such a transition. ""We’re intensely creative people in West Virginia,” Sell said. “We have the drive to bring ourselves out of this, to build ourselves up. We just need resources and support.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories. Andrew McCormick is an independent journalist in Washington, D.C.

" Families priced out of the white-hot housing market are finding that their hard-earned dollars go further in places like Central Texas, where the blazing heat means home prices are markedly cooler. “I’m willing to exchange one extreme for the next to have a change in scenery and the opportunity to have more space,” said Elsie Ayala, a Californian raised in Chicago, who just purchased a 1,700-square-foot home in Pflugerville, a suburb of Austin, Texas, for slightly more than her $400,000 budget. It's one of many regions that have seen record home sales in the last year as first-time homebuyers like Ayala are priced out of large cities and areas with more moderate weather, said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist with real estate brokerage firm Redfin. “There is a price premium on nice weather."" The result is a massive influx of new homeowners into hot climates like Texas, a state that is less prepared for the public health consequences of extreme heat compared to other states, said Megan Weil Latshaw, an associate scientist with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. But for new homeowners like Ayala, buying a place in the extreme heat is the only option. “Our graphs show there is a price premium on nice weather,” said Nicole Bachaud, an economic data analyst with the online real estate brokerage firm Zillow. “That hasn’t really changed.” The country’s top five urban metro areas with the highest number of pleasant days of weather had median home values at around $600,000 in 2019, more than double the national median of $229,000, according to Zillow. Ventura, California, which topped the list, has an average home price of $782,000. San Diego, which came second, has an average home price of more than $858,000. By comparison, Austin’s average home price is around $596,400. “Homes along the West Coast have all become way more expensive in the last decade,” Fairweather said. “For the time being, home prices in areas with higher climate risk are more affordable.” Migration to some of the country’s most sweltering areas comes on the heels of a record hot summer. The average temperature across the U.S. this summer clocked in at 74 degrees Fahrenheit, or 2.6 degrees warmer than the long-term average, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A report from the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that heat waves that previously may have occurred once every 50 years can now be expected every 10 years. While nearly 3 out of 4 people surveyed by Redfin said they would be hesitant to buy a home in an area with extreme temperatures, people are still flocking to such areas. The 50 U.S. counties with the largest share of homes facing high heat risk saw populations increase by an average of about 5 percent from 2016 to 2020, according to an August report from Redfin. Of these counties, 40 had median sale prices below the national level of $315,000, the report showed. Williamson County, where most of the city of Pflugerville is located, had the highest level of growth, at 16 percent. “People are much more fixated on budget and being close to family or work than thinking about climate risk,” Fairweather said. Fabian Gambino, an investment broker from Brooklyn, New York, has lived with his fiancée in Ventura, California, near her office in Santa Barbara for the last year. When the couple was ready to buy a home, they quickly realized they couldn’t afford Ventura — so they moved to Pflugerville. “Down here we’re able to pay a mortgage payment for less than we were paying for rent in California and definitely less than Brooklyn,” said Gambino, who purchased a new 2,600-square-foot home this summer for $700,000. “It's the only option young people have these days, because where do you go?” Ice storms in Texas earlier this year, along with a scorching heat wave this summer, have raised concerns among scientists, local policymakers and residents about the country’s power grid capacity. During the summer heat wave in June, about 70 percent of power plants unexpectedly went offline, putting strain on plants that were still in operation. As temperatures lingered in the 90s, Texas’ power grid operator asked residents to conserve electricity. In Phoenix, an area that saw a 15 percent migration rate between 2016 and 2020, temperatures reached over 115 degrees Fahrenheit for a record-setting six consecutive days in June, according to NOAA. But, unlike Arizona, Texas is not well prepared for the heat and the inflows of new residents, according to a December report from Johns Hopkins University and Trust for America's Health. Texas had a higher number of days with a severe storm causing injury or death, according to the analysis. It also had fewer people proficient in English, which can impact people’s ability to understand and act on public health messages and emergency alerts. Additionally, a higher percentage of the population is nonwhite, which may also affect disaster preparedness resources to areas that are disproportionately communities of color. “When it comes to preparedness for the health effects of climate change, Texas didn’t seem to have even identified the health effects related to risks in the state,” Latshaw said. “Neither did they identify interventions to address them.” For homeowners like Ayala, the heat means added costs to maintain her home. The roof needs to be partially replaced, because the Texas sun and hail have thinned out its shingles or popped them off entirely. Her 20-year-old air conditioner went out briefly this month and needed a new fuse. Ayala has bought a variety of insurance policies to protect her home in the event of a storm or additional damage from the heat. “I come from a traditional Mexican family, and [my parents] do not have money to support me. If anything, I need to help them,” she said. “I want to be prepared if anything goes wrong because I feel like with Texas, I definitely need it.” Breaking news emails Be the first to know about breaking news and other NBC News reports.

" A child born in 2021 will live on average through seven times as many heat waves, twice as many wildfires and nearly three times as many droughts, crop failures and river floods as their grandparents, according to a study released Sunday that looks at how different generations will be affected by climate change. The results, published in the journal Science, found that global warming will disproportionately affect the lives of young people and children, particularly when it comes to extreme events worsened by climate change. The research is the first to extensively model extreme events and future climate scenarios and to apply the projections across demographic groups to quantify how people in different age groups around the world will experience climate disasters across their lifetimes. The outlook is troubling if the pace of global warming continues unchecked, said Wim Thiery, a climate scientist at Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium, who led the research. ""We found that everyone under 40 today will live an unprecedented life in terms of their lifetime exposure to heat waves, droughts and floods,"" Thiery said. ""This is true even under the most conservative scenarios."" The study shows stark intergenerational inequities across the board, but the researchers said climate change will affect children in developing countries even more acutely. The burden will remain disproportionate even with cuts in greenhouse gas emissions that countries have pledged under the Paris Agreement, a global climate pact signed by more than 190 countries. With what has currently been pledged, 172 million children in sub-Saharan Africa could live through 50 times more heat waves and a sixfold increase in extreme events over their lifetimes, compared to 53 million children in the same age group in Europe and Central Asia, the researchers said. While the results are already worrisome, Thiery said it's likely that impacts on people's lives will be even greater than the study estimates. That's because the researchers focused only on the frequency of extreme events, which doesn't take into account how long and severe they are. Studies have shown that climate change is making events like heat waves, droughts and wildfires not only more likely to occur, but also more intense. ""We don't account for the fact that a bad heat wave might last twice as long in the future as it does today,"" Thiery said. He added that the researchers also considered extreme events in isolation, which means the study didn't cover how the impacts of such disasters could be amplified if they coincide. ""There's a tendency for these things to occur at the same time,"" Thiery said. ""Think about heat waves and droughts or river flooding and tropical cyclones."" But, Thiery said, there's reason for hope. If countries can make aggressive cuts in their greenhouse gas emissions and limit the effects of global warming, some of the study's most dire scenarios can be avoided, he said. Young people have been at the forefront of climate activism, with movements like the ""Fridays for Future"" protests demanding action from governments. The discussions will be particularly important in the coming weeks as world leaders are scheduled to convene from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12 in Glasgow, Scotland, for the 2021 U.N. Climate Change Conference, where countries are expected to set forth ambitious targets to reduce emissions by 2030. ""This should be a call for action,"" Thiery said. ""We have it in our hands to avoid the worst of global warming. For all of us alive today, we need to combat climate change."" Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories.

" Vanuatu is asking the International Court of Justice to issue an opinion on the rights of present and future generations to be protected from the adverse impacts of climate change. Vanuatu, with a population of some 280,000 people spread across roughly 80 islands, is among more than a dozen Pacific island nations facing rising sea levels and more regular storms that can wipe out much of their economies. ""In response to the catastrophic levels of climate change loss and damage faced by this small Pacific nation, Vanuatu recognises that current levels of action and support for vulnerable developing countries within multilateral mechanisms are insufficient,"" the government said in a statement on Saturday. Vanuatu said it will route the initiative through the United Nations General Assembly.

" WOODBINE, N.J. — Shawn LaTourette sees a warning on the coast of New Jersey in the miles of Atlantic white cedar trees that have devolved into what researchers call ghost forests.  It’s a term that points to the visceral changes of the landscape — going from lush green to a pale white — and the destruction of the area’s crucial role as a biodome and coastal buffer. These once-thriving forests are a direct result of climate change as the trees are suffocated by saltwater intrusion sparked by sea level rise and an uptick of hurricanes and superstorms.   “If we pay close attention to our environment, we often see that it sends us signals,” LaTourette, the state’s commissioner of environmental protection, said while walking along a ghost forest spanning more than 300 acres in southern New Jersey. “This is a signal about that risk that we all face from saltwater intrusion from storm surge.” The Atlantic white cedar forests are seen as the first line of defense on New Jersey’s coast. They thrive in freshwater wetlands — swamps so thick that extreme caution and a good pair of wader boots are necessary in order to walk through them. As sea levels rise, these trees are hit first, and the saltwater intrusion is killing them due to their sensitive nature. That water will then move on to inundate farm fields, peoples’ homes, drinking water and businesses. Along much of the Eastern Seaboard, the once-healthy coastal woodlands are dwindling rapidly — to the extent that if the rate of decline continues, these forested wetlands will reach the “point of no return within the century,” according to  University of Virginia and Duke University researchers focused on studying the ecosystems. Ghost forests are already a problem all along the East Coast and in states along the Gulf Coast, such as Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Coastal woodlands like these are critical ecosystems in the United States, as they filter pollutants, act as natural barriers and store carbon in the ground. But their positioning on the coast puts them at the vanguard of rising sea levels brought on by the warming atmosphere, therefore worsening some of the effects of climate change. “To be able to look at these forests and see that this is a direct result from climate change is frightening,” says Kristen Meistrell, a Stewardship Project director for the New Jersey Audubon Society, which focuses on environmental awareness and conservation. Meistrell has worked here for nearly  10 years and recalls walks she used to take on the property when she  started in 2012, surrounded by live Atlantic white cedar trees. Since then, she’s watched the forests completely die off. “I think every community, every resident, every business has to ask itself hard questions."" SHAWN LATOURETTE, NEW JERSEY COMMISSIONER OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION The state and environmental groups are scrambling to restore the cedar species in environments that aren’t as immediately threatened by impending storm surges. Foresters and environmental groups are largely focused on restoring forests in new homes, where they won’t be hit by sea level rise. The groups have cleared out large swaths of land typically filled with other hardwoods like maple, to allow remaining healthy cedars to drop seeds naturally with adequate space and access to sunlight. The New Jersey Audubon Society leverages farmers’ and hunters’ attachment to the land, working with them on their private property to develop forest stewardship plans to manage the property for wildlife like these cedars.  “We’re trying to put this forest type back on the landscape,”  State Forester John Sacco said. “When we do that, we’re introducing biodiversity. There are suites of organisms that occur with this forest type that you really don’t find in other forests. It increases biodiversity, helps with resiliency, and it’s part of our natural heritage that we need to keep around and bequeath to the next generation.”   This will take some time. A healthy cedar forest will take decades to develop, and they’re playing catch up after losing more than 80 percent of the woodlands due to logging over the last two centuries.  Growing new trees in safer homes is just one conservation method in their toolbox, as New Jersey and other states also focus on protecting what already exists. The Nature Conservancy works on refuges along the Outer Banks in North Carolina, where it is building oyster reefs and ditch networks to slow down erosion and control water running upstream, and adding more vegetation that can tolerate salt water into the peat soils where the trees typically grow, making root systems more sturdy.  The scientists from University of Virginia and Duke project that coastal forested wetlands will be “drowned and salted out of existence through the North American Coastal Plain within 100 years,” but also note this isn’t the only region globally that’s at risk. Environments in Brazil, Ukraine and Mozambique have similar wetland ecosystems, but don’t currently have research available.  “I think every community, every resident, every business has to ask itself hard questions,” LaTourette said, “about whether it is positioned to confront the ravages of climate change.” CORRECTION (Sept. 23, 2021, 5:18 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misspelled the first name of an Audubon Society executive.

" Standing near an aluminum foil-wrapped welcome sign at Sequoia National Park in Northern California, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday signed a bill directing more than $15 billion to combat wildfires, drought and other climate change-driven challenges facing the state. Newsom signed the spending bill while touring portions of the KNP Complex Fire, where some of the world’s oldest and largest sequoias have been threatened by wildfire in recent days. ""It's an unprecedented investment by any state in U.S. history,"" he said. ""We have a responsibility in California to get things done because we are the tip of the spear."" The climate package includes $5.2 billion for drought response and resilience, $3.7 billion for urban greening projects and coastal protection efforts, and $3.9 billion to fast-track the state's goal of switching to all zero-emissions vehicles by 2035. Newsom also approved nearly $1 billion in new spending to prevent wildfires, signaling a policy shift in a state that historically focused more on putting out fires than stopping them before they start. California spent $3.4 billion on wildfire protection last year, more than quadruple the level 15 years ago and a reflection of the reality that wildfires are getting bigger and more destructive from climate change. Six of the state's 10 largest wildfires have happened in the past two years. But state officials have spent the vast majority of that money on extinguishing fires, a job that has become harder as the fires have gotten bigger and hotter. This year, Newsom and the state Legislature agreed to dramatically increase spending on prevention. The initial outlay was about $500 million, but with a record-breaking budget surplus they were able to add nearly $1 billion more for a total of $1.5 billion. “Conditions have never been more challenging,” Wade Crowfoot, secretary of the California Natural Resources Agency, said. “Expanding our upfront proactive actions is essential to address the wildfire risks we now face.” Scientists have long warned that the weather will get wilder as the world warms. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years. Most of the wildfire prevention money will pay for things like clearing brush and dead trees that act as kindling when fires start, causing them to quickly burn out of control before firefighters can contain them. There's money to hire inspectors to make sure newer homes built in the state's wildfire-prone areas comply with building codes requiring fire-resistant materials. And there's money for the state to intentionally set fires when conditions are right to burn away fuel that would otherwise help larger fires burn during the dry season. The money Newsom approved is the final piece of the state's $262.5 billion operating budget. The spending Newsom approved Thursday also includes $1.2 billion for things like water recycling projects, cleaning up contaminated water sources and grants to help communities plan for climate change. Republicans have criticized the spending because it does not include money for water storage projects, like building new reservoirs. California voters approved about $2.7 billion in 2014 for water storage projects. But so far, none of those have been built.

" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told world leaders at the United Nations on Wednesday night that humanity has to “grow up” and tackle climate change, saying humans must stop trashing the planet like a teenager on a bender. Johnson is due to host a major United Nations climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland in six weeks’ time. He is using a trip to the U.N. General Assembly in New York to press governments for tougher emissions-cutting targets and more money to help poor countries clean up their economies. In a speech to the General Assembly on Wednesday, he said it’s now or never if the world is to meet its goal of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. “If we keep on the current track then the temperatures will go up by 2.7 degrees or more by the end of the century. And never mind what that will do to the ice floes,"" Johnson said. “We will see desertification, drought, crop failure, and mass movements of humanity on a scale not seen before. Not because of some unforeseen natural event or disaster, but because of us, because of what we are doing now."" In his speech, Johnson compared humanity to an impetuous 16-year-old — “just old enough to get ourselves into serious trouble.” “We have come to that fateful age when we know roughly how to drive and we know how to unlock the drinks cabinet and to engage in all sorts of activity that is not only potentially embarrassing but also terminal,” he said. “We believe that someone else will clear up the mess we make, because that is what someone else has always done,” he added. “We trash our habitats again and again with the inductive reasoning that we have got away with it so far, and therefore we will get away with it again. “My friends, the adolescence of humanity is coming to an end,” Johnson, said, adding: “We must come together in a collective coming of age.” Hopes for a successful Glasgow summit have been boosted by announcements this week from the world’s two biggest economies and largest carbon polluters, the United States and China. Chinese President Xi Jinping said his country will no longer fund coal-fired power plants abroad, while U.S. President Joe Biden announced a plan to double financial aid for green growth to poorer nations to $11.4 billion by 2024.

" LA VEGA, Guatemala — Darwin Mendez has tried and failed to reach the United States three times. Twenty-three years old and $30,000 in debt, he said leaving Guatemala is his only option. Years of punishing drought scorched the field he farms with his father, mother, uncle and siblings, shrinking the maize and drying out what precious few kernels grow on the tiny cobs.  Then came the rains. Unpredictable storms and back-to-back hurricanes last year brought heavy downpours to the hills of western Guatemala, triggering mudslides that buried Mendez’s crops and left pests and disease in their wake. When the land dried out, it stayed dry, and the region is once again gripped by prolonged heat waves and persistent drought. For Mendez, it means another year of poor harvest. “We don’t have much land — no one does around here — so when we lose crops, we lose everything,” he said. As Guatemala lurches between intense droughts and devastating floods — two extremes made worse by climate change — some farmers like Mendez are being forced to take drastic action, selling whatever they can or borrowing huge sums of money and leaving home. Most will move within the country, to cities in search of work, while others will join the tens of thousands of Guatemalans who each year attempt a much more treacherous journey north. More than one-fifth of the population of Guatemala faces what one United Nations agency considers dangerously high levels of food insecurity. Nearly half of all children in the country under the age of 5 suffer from chronic malnutrition, and in some of the most vulnerable rural communities, that number is significantly higher, according to the U.N. World Food Programme.  “Whatever we grow in the field is not enough to feed ourselves,” Mendez said. “I want to go to the U.S., so I can feed my family.”  More than 250 miles away from where Mendez lives in Huehuetenango, Jose Vasquez is similarly finding it difficult to survive off what he can grow. Vasquez, 42, is a small farmer in Chiquimula, in southern Guatemala. On a recent walk through his sloping field, he snapped corn off of a couple of stalks, pulling aside the papery husks to reveal withered cobs notched with only a few brown kernels. “The problem with the maize is that rain never came,” he said, adding that he feels desperate at times. “I’m afraid because there might not be enough food for my family.” Experts have said climate change could displace hundreds of millions of people around the world as rising sea levels, hotter temperatures and more frequent extreme weather events transform where is livable on the planet. In places already grappling with high levels of poverty, corruption and conflict, the effects of global warming may reach a fragile tipping point for some of the world’s most vulnerable communities.  It’s a situation that is already playing out in Guatemala. Without deep cuts in global emissions, it’s likely that global warming will create climate migrants on just about every continent. The consequences will be staggering. “It’s hard to point to a region of the world that is not going to be heavily impacted by climate change and from migration,” said Nicholas Depsky, a doctoral student at the University of California, Berkeley, and a researcher at the Climate Impact Lab, a consortium of climate scientists from Berkeley, the University of Chicago, the Rhodium Group and Rutgers University. “When you see the writing on the wall, it’s hard to feel like there’s any way that you can overstate the gravity of the situation.” From southeast Asia to Central America, the movement of people displaced by climate change could fuel political conflicts between nations, or deepen existing tensions, Depsky added.  “From a U.S. perspective, migration is already such a flashpoint,” he said. “It’s such a divisive political issue, and Central America is already a big region of focus because of how much it plays into our political discourse here.” Migration has been a focus for the Climate Impact Lab, and Depsky’s research has centered, in particular, on droughts in Central America. Guatemala sits along the so-called Dry Corridor, a stretch of Central America that extends from southern Mexico to Panama where high levels of poverty and a reliance on grain crops in rural communities make people in the region especially vulnerable to climate change. Depsky co-authored a study published in December in the journal Environmental Research Letters that modeled future drought forecasts in Central America. The researchers found that the severity, frequency and duration of droughts throughout the Dry Corridor are projected to worsen through the end of the century. While the models predicted a decrease in average annual precipitation, Depsky said there will likely also be an increase in extreme weather events, including severe storms and heavy downpours, due to climate change. It’s not yet clear whether global warming is making hurricanes more frequent overall, but studies have shown that warmer sea surface temperatures are increasing the chances that storms will become major hurricanes when they do form. Part of the problem is that there is no clear definition, legal or otherwise, on who is a climate migrant. Climate change is rarely the main reason why someone decides to leave their home, but it’s almost certainly a compounding factor in many cases. “It’s really important to look at how climate change interacts with existing vulnerabilities and how climate change exacerbates those vulnerabilities, how it threatens livelihoods, how it increases poverty, how it interacts or tips over into conflict,” said Amali Tower, the founder and executive director of Climate Refugees, a nonprofit organization that aids and raises awareness about climate migration. In Guatemala, years of severe drought interspersed with tropical storms, Hurricanes Eta and Iota last year and other heavy precipitation events have not only destroyed crops but also battered the land, said Paris Rivera, a climatologist at the Mariano Gálvez University of Guatemala. “The plants no longer grow and the soil that remains is infertile,” Rivera said, “causing various problems, especially to the people who use the soil for their crops and for their personal consumption, thus generating incredible food insecurity.” While climate stress will probably drive waves of migration in Guatemala and elsewhere around the world, not everyone will have the means or ability to cross borders. “It’s not as simple as a drought hits the Dry Corridor and all these farmers pick up their things and move north,” Depsky said. “It’s a lot more nuanced, and the people most impacted because they have the fewest resources to adapt and cope are also the ones that can’t afford to move until it’s a life-or-death situation.” As such, most climate migration will likely be among people who have been displaced and forced to move within their home country. A report released earlier this month by the World Bank projected that 216 million people across Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Eastern Europe, North Africa, Central Asia, East Asia and the Pacific could move within their countries by 2050. “Nobody actually wants to be forced to leave their own home,” Tower said. “By and large, how climate change impacts mobility is to create situations of internal displacement.” But with so much on the line in an increasingly untenable situation, some like Mendez feel they don’t have much of a choice but to leave Guatemala and push north. “I’m worried about the future,” he said. “All I can do is pray to God I’ll be able to migrate to the U.S.” Denise Chow reported from New York City, and Carlos P.

" Scientists say the Southern Hemisphere ozone hole is larger than usual and already surpasses the size of Antarctica. The European Union’s Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service said Thursday that the ozone hole, which appears every year during the Southern Hemisphere spring, has grown considerably in the past week following an average start. “Forecasts show that this year´s hole has evolved into a rather larger than usual one,” said Vincent-Henri Peuch, who heads the EU’s satellite monitoring service. “We are looking at a quite big and potentially also deep ozone hole,” he said. Atmospheric ozone absorbs ultraviolet light coming from the sun. Its absence means more of this high-energy radiation reaches Earth, where it can harm living cells. Peuch noted that last year’s ozone hole also started out unremarkably but then turned into one of the longest-lasting ones on record. The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, led to a ban on a group of chemicals called halocarbons that were blamed for exacerbating the annual ozone hole. Experts say it’s likely to take until the 2060s for ozone-depleting substances to be completely phased out. Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories."
" Intense concern about climate change is increasing among people in several major economies, according to a survey released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center that found that 72 percent of those polled were worried climate change will harm them personally at some point in their lifetime. The survey included more than 16,000 people across North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region and represented people's views of the threat of climate change, their willingness to make personal sacrifices to address it and their perceptions of international efforts to curb global warming. The poll was conducted in the spring but its release comes after a series of extreme weather events — ranging from devastating floods in Germany, China and the United States to sweltering heat waves across the Northern Hemisphere — plagued multiple continents in recent months. Most countries saw a sharp increase in those who said they are “very concerned” that climate change will affect them personally in their lifetime. In Germany, for instance, 18 percent of people expressed being “very concerned” in 2015, compared to 37 percent this year. Australia saw a comparable uptick, with 34 percent of people saying they are “very concerned” about climate change, a 16-point increase over 2015. Only Japan saw a significant decline in those who are very concerned about climate change. Pew researchers found an 8-point decrease, to 26 percent, over 2015. In the U.S., these views didn't change significantly since 2015, they said. Public concern about climate change will be a key driver of negotiations among nations at the upcoming U.N. Climate Change Conference in November, where world leaders are expected to set aggressive emissions targets to combat global warming in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. The Pew report found that 80 percent of people polled were willing to make changes in how they live and work to help reduce the impacts of climate change. Reviews of current efforts were more mixed, however, with only 56 percent of people responding that society is doing a ""very"" or ""somewhat good"" job of dealing with global warming. The survey also found ideological differences in people's willingness to make personal sacrifices to address climate change. Those on the left were generally more willing to adjust their lifestyle to reduce the impacts of global warming, with 94 percent of those who identify with the ideological left in the U.S. saying they would be willing to make ""some"" or ""a lot of"" changes to how they work and live, compared to 45 percent who identify with the ideological right. Similar differences were found in Australia, Canada, Germany and the Netherlands, though the biggest ideological gap was among people in the U.S. The survey respondents spanned the U.S., Canada, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. In the study, younger people tended to be more concerned about global warming compared to older adults. In the U.S., 71 percent of people ages 18 to 29 were ""very"" or ""somewhat concerned"" that climate change would affect them personally in their lifetime, compared with 52 percent of those who were 65 and older. Similar differences between age groups were found in Australia, New Zealand, France and Canada. The widest age gap was found in Sweden, where 65 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds expressed concern about being personally impacted by climate change, compared to just 25 percent of adults 65 and older. Youth activists have led climate protests around the world and have pushed leaders to take more aggressive action to combat global warming. But while young people are an integral part of the solution, they are also among those most affected by climate change. A separate preprint study under review by the journal Lancet Planetary Health linked government inaction on climate change to psychological distress and climate anxiety in young people. In that survey, which involved 10,000 children and young people across 10 countries, 74 percent of the respondents said they believe that ""the future is frightening."" Forty-five percent of young people in the study said climate anxiety and distress are affecting their daily lives and functioning, and almost two-thirds of the respondents said governments are not doing enough to protect them from climate change. ""It's shocking to hear how so many young people from around the world feel betrayed by those who are supposed to protect them,"" Liz Marks, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom and co-lead author of the study, said in a statement. ""Now is the time to face the truth, listen to young people, and take urgent action against climate change."" Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories.

" Without immediate action to combat climate change, rising sea levels, water scarcity and declining crop productivity could force 216 million people to migrate within their own countries by 2050, the World Bank said in a new report on Monday. The report, Groundswell 2.0, modeled the impacts of climate change on six regions, concluding that climate migration “hotspots” will emerge as soon as 2030 and intensify by 2050, hitting the poorest parts of the world hardest. Sub-Saharan Africa alone would account for 86 million of the internal migrants, with 19 million more in North Africa, the report showed, while 40 million migrants were expected in South Asia and 49 million in East Asia and the Pacific. Such movements will put significant stress on both sending and receiving areas, straining cities and urban centers and jeopardizing development gains, the report said. For instance, sea-level rise threatens rice production, aquaculture and fisheries, which could create an out-migration hotspot in Vietnam’s low-lying Mekong Delta. But the Red River Delta and central coast region, where those people are likely to flee, face their own threats, including severe storms. Conflicts and health and economic crises such as those unleashed by the COVID-19 pandemic could compound the situation, the bank said. And the number of climate migrants could be much higher since the report does not cover most high-income countries, countries in the Middle East and small island states, or migration to other countries. The report’s authors say their findings should be seen as an urgent call to regional and national governments and the global community to act now to reduce greenhouse gases, close development gaps and restore ecosystems. Doing so, they said, could reduce that migration number by 80 percent to 44 million people. “We’re already locked into a certain amount of warming, so climate migration is a reality,” said Kanta Kumari Rigaud, the bank’s lead environment specialist and one of the report’s co-authors. “We have to reduce or cut our greenhouse gases to meet the Paris target, because those climate impacts are going to escalate and increase the scale of climate migration.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories."
" GLENWOOD SPRINGS, Colo. — The flash flood roared down Glenwood Canyon with such force that it changed the course of the Colorado River. Torrents of mud, boulders as big as cars and toppled trees plunged down towering walls of rock carved over millennia. When it was over, the July 29 mudslide left a gaping hole in Interstate 70. The river of mud had breached a wall and swept across the highway, sending the eastbound deck crashing into the waterway and burying one of the most scenic drives in Colorado under 6 feet of debris. ""This is dirt the dinosaurs walked on, and it's all gone,"" said Tim Holbrook, a supervisor with the Colorado Transportation Department, who has seen all manner of blizzards, floods and wildfires in 19 years in highway maintenance but nothing like this summer's spectacle. When the interstate through Glenwood Canyon was built it was considered an engineering marvel, an ambitious construction project that preserved the stunning environment. But the 12-mile corridor through the canyon in western Colorado leaves little room for maneuvering, and traffic is easily disrupted. Experts say the situation is magnified by the changing climate and its cascade of crises this summer: drought, wildfires, monsoons and mudflows. The physical alterations have led to road closures, hourslong detours, environmental disasters and economic displacement. And they have prompted hard questions about aging infrastructure designed decades before climate change moved to the forefront of public discourse. ""This should be a warning, the canary in the coal mine,"" said Paul Chinowsky, director of the environmental design department at the University of Colorado. ""It's time to go back and look at where our critical transportation routes are, because most of them are probably pretty vulnerable to this type of situation."" ""We cannot let the engineering hubris or arrogance overcome the science of saying what you design for no longer exists,"" he said. Maintenance crews continue to repair a 1½-mile section of the interstate. Traffic is down to one lane in each direction where it was most damaged. Workers have been dogged by smaller slides and weather threats that have forced them to close the highway nine times. The slide also took out utilities and communication networks. ""We have this great confidence that this one thing will never fail. And then when it does fail, everyone runs around going, 'How did that happen?'"" Chinowsky said. ""All it takes is one disruption, and you really have economic damage."" The closures have profoundly affected Glenwood Springs, a tourism-dependent resort city whose renowned hot springs have drawn visitors for generations. Many people with reservations at hotels this summer who drove in from the Denver area were subjected to three- to four-hour detours. The historic Hotel Colorado was hit with $72,000 in cancellations in a single day. Workers in the hospitality industry could not get to their jobs, and some staffers at Valley View Hospital had to be flown in by helicopter from their homes on the other side of the slide. ""Our resiliency is being tested,"" Mayor Jonathan Godes said. ""We will recover, but communities that can't, communities that don't have the ability, the finance, the tax base to be able to do projects, to provide a bit of resiliency, redundancy, are going to really struggle in the new paradigm."" When the interstate is closed, traffic is diverted through Steamboat Springs, a town of 13,000 people about a three-hour drive from Glenwood Springs that is a gateway to some of the best skiing and outdoor activities in Colorado. Hundreds of semitrucks and tractor-trailers rumble through the downtown corridor lined with shops and restaurants, braking at the eight stop lights and belching exhaust fumes. ""It's not how we want people to experience our beautiful place,"" said Kara Stoller, CEO of the Steamboat Springs Chamber of Commerce. ""When I-70 is closed in Glenwood Canyon, the residents are not motivated or excited to even go through town."" Andrew Hoell, a research meteorologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said ""really extreme"" weather events about a year apart led to the mudflow. Record-low rainfall from January 2020 through May 2021, combined with historically high temperatures, created ""a perfect storm,"" he said. A NOAA report said the phenomenon was ""exceptional in the observational climate record since 1895."" ""We call these compounding and cascading events, where they build on one another and they produce very bad consequences at the end,"" Hoell said. Evidence that the mudslide was caused by climate change is ""overwhelming,"" he said. ""The higher temperatures are creating more demand of the land surface moisture, causing droughts to get that much worse."" Drought soon led to wildfire. Last year, the Grizzly Creek fire chewed up trees and other vegetation on both sides of the interstate. It burned for months, destroying over 32,000 acres and closing the interstate in Glenwood Canyon for two weeks. The fire was so intense that ash fell in Denver, 155 miles away. Then came this year's seasonal monsoons, which typically cause intense mountain storms that pass quickly. This one dumped over 4 inches of rain in five days, double the average monthly rainfall, causing the ground to collapse on the burn scar and trapping over 100 people in vehicles below. The mudslide blew out the parapet wall on westbound I-70, ripped the road away on the eastbound interstate and crashed into the Colorado River. Drone video revealed a gash in a mountain rising thousands of feet to what was once forestland. The collapse left 6 feet of mud and debris on the highway, which took 2½ weeks and 4,000 truckloads to clear. ""The problem that most people run into when they're looking at climate is they put it into silos, they compartmentalize it,"" Chinowsky said. ""And that's not the way things work when it comes to a system. Anywhere you poke at it, somewhere else is going to get out of balance, and that's exactly what happened with Glenwood Canyon."" The Colorado River used to run wide through the passage, but it has narrowed with the accumulation of sediment, affecting the habitat and food supply of trout and other fish. Biologists are concerned that the fish that survived will not be able to build their nests, called redds, to lay eggs and that the insects they feed on will perish. ""We've had some reports from folks that have been on the river rafting and anglers that have noticed some fish that have been dead as a result of the mudslides,"" said Lori Martin, an aquatic biologist with Colorado Parks and Wildlife. ""But we don't know what that means long-term in terms of impacts to the entire population and fish communities."" Today, massive sandbags weighing 3,000 pounds are the first line of defense against another slide. The state is working to fully reopen the most damaged part of I-70 through Glenwood Canyon by Thanksgiving. ""Who knows what the future will bring?"" said Holbrook, of the Transportation Department, who is bracing for the next slide and more damage to the picturesque highway. ""You can pretty much engineer yourself out of anything,"" he said. ""What's viable? Can it be built? Yeah, but at what cost?"" CORRECTION (Sept. 12, 2021, 11:48 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated when Interstate 70 through Glenwood Canyon was built. Construction began in 1980, not 1963.

" The United States had its hottest summer on record this year, narrowly edging out the previous milestone that was set 85 years ago during the Dust Bowl. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Thursday that the average temperature this summer for the contiguous U.S. was 74 degrees Fahrenheit, or 2.6 degrees warmer than the long-term average. The heat record caps off a season full of extremes, with parts of the country experiencing persistent drought, wildfires, record-breaking heat waves, hurricanes and other extreme weather exacerbated by climate change. This summer beat the previous record set in 1936 by a hair, coming in at less than 0.01 degrees warmer than during the Dust Bowl year, when huge portions of the West and Great Plains were parched by severe drought. Though this year's summer was technically hotter than 1936, the very small gap puts the two years ""neck and neck,"" in what NOAA called a ""virtual tie."" NOAA's report spans ""meteorological summer,"" which covers June, July and August. During that time, 18.4 percent of the country experienced record-high temperatures, including five states — California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Utah — that had their warmest summers in recorded history, according to the agency. ""Sixteen additional states had a top-five warmest summer on record. No state ranked below average for the summer season,"" NOAA officials wrote in the climate report. In June, the Pacific Northwest suffered through a heat wave that shattered all-time temperature records in Seattle and Portland, Oregon. More than 35 cities in the western U.S. tied or set heat records during the multiday heat wave, where temperatures soared to up to 120 degrees Fahrenheit in some places. Global warming is making heat waves and other extreme weather events both more likely and more severe, and climate scientists have said conditions this summer offer a glimpse of what could become more common in the future. NOAA's report highlighted other extreme events that plagued the country in August, including devastating floods from Tropical Storm Fred, which hit western North Carolina; Tropical Storm Henri, which soaked parts of the Northeast; and flash flooding that killed at least 22 people in Tennessee. Hurricane Ida, which battered Louisiana and left a trail of destruction from the Gulf Coast into the Northeast, also drenched huge swaths of the country from late August into September. ""With 35 fatalities accounted for during August, it was the deadliest month for flooding across the U.S. since Hurricane Harvey in 2017,"" NOAA officials wrote in the report. Dry conditions in the Western U.S. have also fueled a catastrophic wildfire season. In California, the Dixie Fire became the second largest in the state's history, while the Caldor Fire forced thousands to flee from South Lake Tahoe in late August.

" Researchers have completed a comprehensive online map of the world’s coral reefs by using more than 2 million satellite images from across the globe. The Allen Coral Atlas, named after late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, will act as a reference for reef conservation, marine planning and coral science as researchers try to save these fragile ecosystems that are being lost to climate change. The group announced completion of the atlas Wednesday and said it is the first global, high-resolution map of its kind. It gives users the ability to see detailed information about local reefs, including different types of submarine structure like sand, rocks, seagrass and, of course, coral. The maps, which include areas up to 50 feet (15 meters) deep, are being used to inform policy decisions about marine protected areas, spatial planning for infrastructure such as docks and seawalls and upcoming coral restoration projects. “Our biggest contribution in this achievement is that we have a uniform mapping of the entire coral reef biome,” said Greg Asner, managing director of the Atlas and director of Arizona State University’s Center for Global Discovery and Conservation. Asner said they relied on a network of hundreds of field contributors who gave them local information about reefs so that they could program their satellites and software to focus on the right areas. “And that lets us bring the playing field up to a level where decisions can be made at a bigger scale because so far decisions have been super localized,” Asner said. “If you don’t know what you’ve got more uniformly, how would the U.N. ever play a real role? How would a government that has an archipelago with 500 islands make a uniform decision?” The atlas also includes a coral bleaching monitor to check for corals that are stressed due to global warming and other factors. Asner said about a third of the world’s reefs had not previously been mapped in this kind of in-depth way, and many not at all. The project began in 2017 when Allen’s company, Vulcan Inc., was working with Ruth Gates, a Hawaii researcher whose idea of creating “ super coral ” for reef restoration was funded by the philanthropic foundation. Gates and Vulcan brought in Asner because of his work with the Global Airborne Observatory that had been mapping reefs in Hawaii at the time. Allen, who said he wanted to help save the world’s coral reefs, liked the idea of using technology to visualize data, so Gates connected the group with a satellite company called Planet, and Allen funded the project for about $9 million. The University of Queensland in Australia used artificial intelligence technology and local reference data to generate the layers on the atlas. Anyone can view the maps for free online. Both Allen and Gates passed away in 2018, leaving Asner and others to carry on their work. “Ruth would be so pleased, wouldn’t she?” Asner said. “She would just be tickled that this is really happening.” He said about a third of the calls he is getting are from researchers who hope to use the maps to “be sure that their planning and their reef restoration work is going to have its max efficacy.” When Gates found out she was sick, she selected friend and colleague Helen Fox from the National Geographic Society to help communicate with conservation groups about how to use the tool. “It really was a global effort,” said Fox, who is now the conservation science director for Coral Reef Alliance. “There were huge efforts in terms of outreach and helping people be aware of the tool and the potential scientific and conservation value.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories."
" Residents across the country are still mopping up from the remnants of Hurricane Ida, which hit the Gulf Coast before sweeping up into the Northeast, leaving parts of New York City and its suburbs under water this past week. Dozens were killed, many after being trapped in their cars by flood waters. News and social media from across the New York-New Jersey region show cars that were abandoned along major highways as well as neighborhood streets. With prices for used cars at record levels, the temptation to resell flood-damaged cars could prove more tempting than ever this year. The flooding from Ida caps a summer season that has left many parts of the country waterlogged. That, in turn, has created major headaches for car owners — and car buyers. Thousands of vehicles have been seriously damaged or completely ruined. But many owners soon could find that, despite carrying insurance, they are out of luck when it comes to recouping their losses. In the months to come, meanwhile, some of those flood-damaged vehicles may show back up on the used vehicle market through an appropriately named scam known as “title washing.” Someone buying one of those vehicles could be in for a number of headaches. When a vehicle is submerged, it is subject to developing all sorts of issues, starting with mold. Body panels and other components can rust. Water can damage engines. And then there are all the electronic circuits that control everything from power windows to a car’s safety and infotainment systems. They can suffer intermittent or complete failures. ""A car that's been in a flood, with the engine emerged for any length of time, will never be the same,"" said Carl Sullivan, a veteran inspector for California-based AiM Mobile Inspections. Drying out a car as quickly as possible, especially if it’s been submerged in salt water, is critical, Sullivan and other experts stress. They also warn drivers not to immediately try to start up a vehicle after a flood, especially one where water might have gotten into the engine. That could lead to a catastrophic failure known as hydrolock. Instead, find a repair shop trained in dealing with water damage and have the vehicle towed in. Motorists should take detailed pictures that can help support an insurance claim. Unfortunately, many owners discover too late that their coverage doesn’t include flooding. “If you want to be covered for flood damage of your car you’re going to need comprehensive coverage which takes in acts of god such as hail damage or flood damage,” said Mark Fitzpatrick, an analyst with website MoneyGeek. If your vehicle is new and still covered by a loan or lease, Fitzpatrick noted, you likely carry comprehensive insurance, as it’s normally required as a part of your agreement. But older vehicles that have been paid off, he added, often have just the more minimal insurance coverage most states require. In that case, repairs — or even the replacement of the entire vehicle — may have to come out of pocket. For those looking forward, industry data show comprehensive coverage typically adds between $400 and $500 annually to your insurance bill, though a variety of factors can influence the figure, including where you live, the cost of the vehicle and your driving record. Vehicle owners aren’t the only ones who need to worry about flood-damaged vehicles, however. And that warning is especially important at a time when inventories of new and used cars are in especially short supply. Legally, any vehicle damaged or declared totaled due to flooding should have that clearly marked on its title. Legally, any vehicle damaged or declared totaled due to flooding should have that clearly marked on its title. Most of them will either be scrapped and recycled or they may be broken down for parts. In some cases, owners may try to dry out a vehicle and then sell it, without alerting the buyer that it had been in a flood, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau. There are also plenty of scam artists, the NICB notes, who make a living out of acquiring flooded vehicles at bargain prices. The cars are cleaned up, then taken out of state where the VIN (the unique Vehicle Identification Number) is switched and the car is retitled with no indication it has been damaged. Purchase one of these vehicles and you might not immediately notice any problems but, over time, the smell of mold could become apparent, corrosion might develop, or lights and electrical circuits could start giving you trouble. “Water-damaged vehicles can be transported anywhere for resale, and often continue to appear in the marketplace for many months following major floods,” AAA spokesperson Ellen Edmonds said in a statement. The travel and road service recommends motorists acquire a vehicle history from companies like CarFax before purchasing a used car, truck or crossover. It should reveal if the vehicle has been flood damaged. Many buyers also take a vehicle to a mechanic to be checked out. Because of ongoing shortages of semiconductor chips, new vehicle production has plunged and dealers are short of inventory this year. That’s sending many customers over to the used car market which, in turn, has driven up prices for previously owned vehicles to record levels. For some scam artists — as well as owners who don’t have insurance on their vehicles — the temptation to resell flood-damaged cars could prove more tempting than ever this year.

" J. Lee Driskell was already on the road from her home in Brooksville, Florida, to Louisiana in her camper — the “Hurricane Hilton,” as she calls it — when she got a call hiring her to bring crews to help clean up after Hurricane Ida.  It’s the kind of call that’s becoming more frequent. Driskell's traveling disaster response company, HernandoAg, has grown from a fledgling two-person business during the brutal days after Hurricane Florence in 2018 to a government subcontractor with hundreds of workers.  Like thousands of other businesses, HernandoAg makes money from disaster recovery jobs across the country, helping communities do everything from picking up trash and hauling debris to local dumps to removing trees that threaten power lines after storms like Ida. Once fragmented, the disaster recovery industry has grown swiftly in response to the many major natural disasters that have hit the U.S. in recent years. Even Wall Street has taken notice. “There is no way this industry is going to slow down,” said Driskell, who joined the company as a co-owner with her boyfriend after losing all of her belongings in two hurricanes. “There is only going to be more and more disasters. For me, it’s a no-brainer.” The United States set a record in 2020 of $22 billion in damage from weather and climate events, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and natural disaster recovery businesses like the ones led by Driskell are expecting to grow. Almost half of restoration and recovery companies plan to see a 10 percent increase in sales revenue this year, according to the Cleanfax Restoration Benchmarking Survey, a trade publication that publishes an annual survey tracking trends in the restoration and cleaning business. “This is an industry that with climate change is going to be increasingly more in demand,” said Amy Chester, managing director of the nonprofit disaster recovery advocacy group Rebuild by Design. “We’ve seen with Covid and other storms that once supply chains are broken and you can’t get what you need from the Home Depot adjacent from your house, there will always be a second industry to fill that need.” Days before a storm is expected, workers begin gathering supplies and preparing to travel to where the storm will hit. The jobs themselves are a blend of first responder and cleanup crews. During the first weeks after a storm, workers are charged with clearing debris from roads and neighborhoods so that ambulances and fire trucks can reach areas cut off by fallen trees or downed power lines. Because they are often the first to arrive in devastated areas, they frequently are called on to free families pinned inside their homes from a fallen tree or tie down tarps to prevent rain from causing more damage to a building. “I tell everybody I do God’s work because there are not a lot of us out there who can pick up and go,” said Jason Marshall, owner of Marshall Family Services, a disaster recovery company in Soso, Mississippi. “When someone is in devastation and they have nothing, we’re here to help them pick up the pieces.” It can be a grueling and dangerous job. In the first weeks after a natural disaster, government agencies are often stretched or have broken down leading to confusion, even chaos, on the ground, said Nik Theodore, a professor in the University of Illinois Chicago’s Department of Urban Planning and Policy. While some companies bus in their own crews, many contractors use social media to find workers or pick up day laborers, often in front of hardware stores, he said. Such ad hoc strategies can lead to wage theft and makes it difficult for workers to recover pay.  “The disaster recovery zone becomes the Wild West, where a lot of rules go out the window,” he said. While starting pay is typically around $15 an hour, the hours are long. Storm laborers often work 12- to 17-hour days, through power and water outages and little or no access to showers or bathrooms, according to NBC News interviews with more than a dozen storm workers. One worker said she slept on a case of water bottles in her truck after Hurricane Florence. Another worker said that during the Texas ice storm in February, four workers piled into a truck and ran the engine all night to stay warm. “You’re 100 percent on your own,” said Michael Kelly, who runs a debris hauling company based in Callahan, Florida. After Hurricane Irma hit Florida in 2017, Kelly paid to sleep at a flooded hotel that lost its roof in the storm.  “It was better than sleeping in a truck,” he said.  The tough conditions have become accepted in an industry that is becoming big business.  Disaster cleanup is now a $200 billion industry led by about a dozen dominant players and thousands of small  businesses competing for a slice of a growing revenue pool, according to Mark Springer, president of the Restoration Industry Association, a trade group that represents businesses that restore or clean property damage as a result of floods, fires or sewage accidents. As climate change boosts the frequency and destructiveness of natural disasters, the restoration industry is only expected to expand. “The size of the industry really depends on the number of natural disasters we have in a year,” Springer said. “With this year’s polar vortex, hurricanes and wildfires in California, it’s going to be a big year.” The restoration and disaster recovery industry has gone through a recent wave of consolidation, partially driven by private equity acquisitions in a sign that Wall Street finds it a source of steady and reliable cash flow. The private equity giant Blackstone bought a majority stake in the U.S. restoration franchise company Servpro in 2019. That same year, American Securities acquired the Michigan-based restoration company Belfor. More recently, Brookstone Partners provided financing to Hudson Valley Restoration & Mitigation to help it acquire local competitors. But even with widespread consolidation, storm chasers still dominate a niche market that is considered too unpredictable for private equity, Springer said.   From May to November, storm workers are ready to pack up and head toward disaster areas at a moment’s notice. Many depend on Facebook groups such as “Storm Work” to follow storms or seek truck drivers and subcontractors with heavy equipment. “We Been Notified By 2 Different Primes To Be Ready If ‘HITS LOUISIANA’…..NEED 100 PUSH CREWS…LAFAYETTE-MISSISSIPPI LINE….” reads a post in the Facebook group from Thursday. “I got a skid steer, grapple, mulcher, and operator,” reads another post from Saturday. “Just need to know who is hiring for Ida.” Storm recovery companies earn their income through home insurance payouts, utility company contracts or securing a highly coveted deal as a prime contractor with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, deals that can be worth tens of millions of dollars. But top contractors subcontract out to smaller companies who then contract other companies, with each tier taking a cut. By the time it reaches the smallest business at the bottom rung, revenues can be thin and payday can be delayed, according to several disaster recovery businesses interviewed by NBC News. “It’s very stressful,” Kelly said. “I live off credit cards.” But the precarity of storm work has its benefits. After a few months of relentless work, workers are able to rest and work more regular hours chopping down trees or working construction closer to home. The hope, Driskell said, is that the company will grow large enough to move up the chain of government contracting and snag a prime deal with FEMA. “You’re not making a fortune doing this,” she said. “But you help people and you get to feel good about it.” Breaking news emails Be the first to know about breaking news and other NBC News reports.

" GENEVA — Weather disasters are striking the world four to five times more often and causing seven times more damage than in the 1970s, the United Nations weather agency reports. But these disasters are killing far fewer people. In the 1970s and 1980s, they killed an average of about 170 people a day worldwide. In the 2010s, that dropped to about 40 per day, the World Meteorological Organization said in a report Wednesday that looks at more than 11,000 weather disasters in the past half-century. The report comes during a disaster-filled summer globally, with the United States simultaneously struck by powerful Hurricane Ida and an onslaught of drought-worsened wildfires. “The good news is that we have been able to minimize the amount of casualties once we have started having growing amount of disasters: heatwaves, flooding events, drought, and especially ... intense tropical storms like Ida, which has been hitting recently Louisiana and Mississippi in the United States,” Petteri Taalas, WMO’s secretary-general, told a news conference. “But the bad news is that the economic losses have been growing very rapidly and this growth is supposed to continue,” he added. “We are going to see more climatic extremes because of climate change, and these negative trends in climate will continue for the coming decades.” In the 1970s, the world averaged about 711 weather disasters a year, but from 2000 to 2009 that was up to 3,536 a year or nearly 10 a day, according to the report, which used data from the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters in Belgium. The average number of yearly disasters dropped a bit in the 2010s to 3,165, the report said. Most death and damage during 50 years of weather disasters came from storms, flooding and drought. More than 90 percent of the more than 2 million deaths are in what the U.N. considers developing nations, while nearly 60 percent of the economic damage occurred in richer countries. In the 1970s, weather disasters cost about $175 million a year globally, when adjusted to 2019 dollars, the U.N. found. That increased to $1.38 billion a year in the 2010s. What’s driving the destruction is that more people are moving into dangerous areas as climate change is making weather disasters stronger and more frequent, U.N. disaster and weather officials said. Meanwhile, they said, better weather warnings and preparedness are lessening the death toll. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics “The good news is we’re learning how to live with risk and protect ourselves,” said Susan Cutter, director of the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina, who wasn’t part of the report. “On the other hand, we’re still making stupid decisions about where we’re putting our infrastructure. ... But it’s OK. We’re not losing lives, we’re just losing stuff.” Hurricane Ida is a good example of heavy damage and what will probably be less loss of life than past major hurricanes, Cutter said. This year, she added, weather disasters “seem to be coming every couple weeks,” with Ida, U.S. wildfires and floods in Germany, China and Tennessee. “The number of weather, climate and water extremes are increasing and will become more frequent and severe in many parts of the world as a result of climate change,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. The five most expensive weather disasters since 1970 were all storms in the United States, topped by 2005’s Hurricane Katrina, the report said. The five deadliest weather disasters were in Africa and Asia — topped by the Ethiopian drought and famine in the mid 1980s and Cyclone Bhola in Bangladesh in 1970.

" Long before Hurricane Ida made landfall Sunday in southern Louisiana, climatologist David Keellings was already filled with dread. As the storm passed over the western end of Cuba and moved over the Gulf of Mexico, Keellings, an assistant professor at the University of Florida, knew it would become fierce and unruly. ""I was saying, 'Uh oh, it’s going to head over some really warm water,'"" he said. ""And it did."" Once the storm began churning up the Gulf's unusually warm water — 86 degrees at places, even at depths of more than 100 feet — things escalated quickly. Over the next 24 hours, the hurricane underwent a process known as rapid intensification, growing from a Category 1 to a Category 4 storm only shortly before it roared over the coastline. ""I was thinking: 'Oh dear, this is happening too quickly and too close to land,'"" Keellings said. ""It's going to have major impacts."" Keellings and other scientists are paying close attention to Ida's rapid intensification. Although hurricanes are unique systems driven by a complex interplay of atmospheric and ocean dynamics, experts say how Ida formed and how it behaves portend the types of hurricanes that are more likely because of climate change. ""We expect global warming to make this process of rapid intensification much more likely going forward,"" said Gabriel Vecchi, a professor of geosciences at Princeton University. ""That's a concern for the coming decades."" Scientists are still trying to understand precisely why some hurricanes strengthen so quickly; compared to other extreme events, such as heat waves, drought or wildfires, it's much more difficult to tease out the exact fingerprints of climate change on individual hurricanes. But what's becoming clear is that global warming is creating the ingredients for storms to become more intense, Vecchi said. A study last year published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences analyzed satellite images from the past four decades and found that the chance that a hurricane will develop into a Category 3 storm or higher increased by around 8 percent per decade, as global warming has accelerated. And along with strengthening them, climate change is making hurricanes wetter, allowing them to dump enormous amounts of rain. ""The physical mechanism that makes hurricanes wetter in a warming climate is really straightforward,"" Vecchi said. ""A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, which simply means a storm can rain more."" Scientists have estimated that for every 1 degree Celsius of temperature rise, the atmosphere can hold 7 percent more evaporated moisture. After it made landfall in Port Fourchon, Hurricane Ida battered Louisiana with winds of more than 170 mph and 15 inches of rain in places. Storm surges up to 7 feet were recorded along parts of the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts. Rising sea levels due to climate change increase the risk of flooding from storm surges, which are produced when wind pushes water from the ocean inland, causing abnormally high ocean levels. ""All other things being equal, if sea levels are higher, then storm surges will be more damaging,"" Vecchi said. ""The total height of the water will be a combination of whatever tides are there, as well as the sea level rise."" It's not clear whether global warming is making hurricanes more frequent, but warmer sea surface temperatures are increasing the chances that storms will become major hurricanes when they form, Keellings said. ""Storms are not changing in terms of what ingredients they need,"" he said. ""What we're doing is giving them more of all these things that they feed on."" That also means that when these types of storms make landfall, the results can be even more disastrous. In August 2017, Hurricane Harvey stalled over southeast Texas, dumping up to 60 inches of rain over parts of Houston and the surrounding area. A study published later in the year in the journal Geophysical Review Letters found that rainfall from Harvey was up to 38 percent higher than would have been expected without global warming. So far, Ida hasn't drenched Louisiana with as much rain as Harvey did in Texas in 2017, but as Ida swings over the Tennessee Valley up into the Northeast in the coming days, rain is one of the biggest concerns, said Texas' state climatologist, John Nielsen-Gammon, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University. ""Even if rainfall totals don't come close to Harvey, places farther inland typically get lower rainfall totals, so they're less prepared for anything like 15 inches of rain in a day,"" he said. Large swaths of the storm's track, including parts of Tennessee, have also had wet summers, which means water levels are already higher than normal and soils are more saturated, which can increase the chances of flooding. Vecchi said the dangers of torrential rain should be top of mind for communities along Ida's path. ""It's easy to focus on the center, but the impacts of a hurricane can extend many miles away,"" he said. ""As it moves to the whole middle of the country, through Mississippi and Tennessee and the northern parts of Alabama and Georgia, that's the thing to keep an eye on.""

" Climate change has made extreme rainfall and floods like those that brought deadly devastation to western Europe last month more likely to occur, according to a new scientific study. Around 200 people died and towns were left in ruins when rivers in Germany and Belgium overflowed their banks after heavy rains this summer. Streets turned into torrential rivers, sweeping away vehicles and reducing houses to rubble. Stranded residents were airlifted from rooftops and rescued in boats after floodwaters inundated their homes. Global warming has made these kinds of events between 1.2 and 9 times more likely, the study said. Released Tuesday by the World Weather Attribution initiative, the research used historical records and computer simulations to examine how temperatures affected rainfall from the late 19th century to the present. While the study hasn’t been assessed by independent scientists yet, its authors use widely accepted methods to conduct rapid assessments of specific weather events such as floods, droughts and heat waves. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics “Climate change made these events more likely and also more intense,” said Sjoukje Philip, one of the lead authors of the study and a researcher at the Dutch weather agency KNMI. “More rainfall can now fall than it could have 100 or 150 years ago, so we do now see the link with climate change.” Nearly 40 researchers from Europe, the U.S. and New Zealand were involved in the study from organizations including the University of Oxford, the U.K.'s Met Office, Germany's weather service and Columbia University. Looking at the area between the Netherlands and the northern Alps, the study found that climate change increased the intensity of rainfall in a single day in the summer by between 3 and 19 percent, when compared to a climate 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than it is currently. If the planet continues to warm, the likelihood and intensity of extreme weather events like the floods would increase even further, it found. Researchers were able to detect the effect of human-induced climate change on rainfall by looking at a larger area, despite the variability of rainfall in the smaller region. In July, German politicians warned that the floods were connected to climate change and pressed for action to battle it. During a visit to one flood-ravaged town, Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that ""we must get faster in the battle against climate change.” According to Philip, the link found between climate change and extreme weather is relevant not only in regard to heavier rainfall in Europe, but also for other extreme weather events like the heat waves in the U.S. this summer. In addition to cutting emissions, “we need to think about how to adapt,” Philip said. “How can we change our behavior so we can deal with these kinds of extremes, because they will become more extreme in the future as climate change becomes more severe.” CORRECTION (Aug. 26, 2021, 4:33 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misspelled the last name of one of the study’s lead authors.

" As large chunks of the Western U.S. burned over the summer, lawmakers in Washington quietly inserted measures into the massive infrastructure package that they hope can be almost as potent as water in fighting them: cash. The $1 trillion infrastructure bill the Senate passed this month included $600 million to raise the pay of federally employed firefighters and to create 1,000 more federal firefighting jobs. Experts say the funds are sorely needed to build a larger, better compensated force to fight fires that, because of climate change, will worsen in the coming years. At the same time, they say, it’s not nearly enough to tackle the intensifying infernos. “All the research we have shows this is going to be a century-long problem. That absolutely presents the dilemma that the measures in the Senate infrastructure bill, while nothing to sneeze at, are really nowhere close to enough,” said a wildfire policy expert, Char Miller, a professor of environmental analysis at Pomona College. The bill, which still must be passed by the House and signed by President Joe Biden to become law, would allow the Agriculture and Interior departments — which oversee the two largest federal firefighting forces (one within the U.S. Forest Service and one within the Bureau of Land Management) — to switch 1,000 seasonal, contract firefighting jobs without benefits to full-time positions that offer benefits. The bill would also raise pay for the firefighter jobs in the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management by, on average, $20,000. In California, federal firefighter salaries start around $28,000, compared to about $66,000 for state firefighters. In addition, the bill would order the Agriculture and Interior departments to work with the Office of Personnel Management to begin reclassifying job descriptions for most federal firefighters, which could further raise pay for those jobs. The federal government would create a civil service job classification of wildland firefighters for those identified as forestry technicians. Separately, the White House this summer raised pay for federal wildland firefighters to make sure all were earning at least $15 an hour, boosting compensation for the majority of the Forest Service’s 14,500 wildland firefighters (who had made, on average, about $13 an hour). “Supporting our brave firefighters with pay, benefits and career opportunities that reflect the importance and danger of the work that they do is critical to facing the mounting wildfire threat,” Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement last week. Seven firefighters died fighting wildfires in 2019, the most recent year for which complete data are available, according to federal data. The additional funding would be a boon to California, in particular, where the vast majority of wildfires have burned this year and in years past. In California and other states across the West, wildfires are fought by a combination of crews from the federal, state and county levels. The command centers can shift from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, based on where a fire is burning at any one time, but the majority of firefighters during the region’s increasingly long “fire season” are employed at the federal level, experts said. Because nearly all wildfires in California start — and expand — on national forestlands, Forest Service firefighters are most often the first and most plentiful crews on the scene. “Our folks have been fighting fire for nearly two months now,” Tony Scardina, deputy regional forester for the Forest Service’s Pacific Southwest region, said Wednesday at a news conference with California officials. “They’re tired. They’re fatigued.” NBC News reported this month that certain squads of federal firefighters and related teams had been instructed to bring their own personal stashes of food, water and other supplies to last them three days. In California, where efforts by federal crews are augmented by the state’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire, the Forest Service has scrambled in recent weeks to fill positions. In mid-July, nearly 20 percent of 4,620 planned permanent and temporary positions were unfilled in the Forest Service’s California region, the agency said. By Aug. 12, according to the agency, about 10 percent of those 4,620 positions remained vacant. The agency also said that it had to hire 2,229 more emergency firefighters and that only 31 of the region’s 44 “hotshot crews” — specialized groups dispatched to major fires — were fully staffed as of Aug. 12. As of Monday, 12 major fires had burned through more than 1.3 million acres in parts of the state — the earliest point on record that the state has surpassed 1 million acres burned. The largest fire is the Dixie Fire, in the Sierra Nevada range, which has burned through more than 724,000 acres and remains only 38 percent contained, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. The Monument Fire in the north-central chunk of the state, which has burned through 148,000 acres, is only 20 percent contained. And the Caldor Fire exploded last week, expanding from 6,500 acres Tuesday morning to about 30,000 acres by the evening hours. It has burned through 104,000 acres and is only 5 percent contained, according to the fire center. Nationwide, nearly 4.6 million acres have burned as of Monday, compared to 3.6 million acres at the same point last year, according to fire center data. Scientists have long argued that wildfires worldwide are worsening because of broad environmental effects brought on by climate change, including hotter temperatures and historically long droughts. And as the Western U.S. gets hotter and more arid, the intensity, severity and frequency of wildfires are certain to continue rising. Experts and wildfire policy analysts say the latest federal efforts do too little to offer incentives to do the dangerous and underpaid work of fighting wildfires and to take action that could, in theory, prevent such rapid growth of wildfires. “Of course it’s a good start, and it’s important, but it’s not going to help solve the long-term issues one bit,” said Miller of Pomona College. “Agencies like the Forest Service burn through their budget just fighting fires, which means that whatever money that could have otherwise been used to help us get ahead of these fires ... is being consumed by the devastating fires of the moment. “Without more, whatever the federal government does to boost firefighter pay will go up in smoke, along with the land,"" he said.

" In a summer already full of extreme weather, it's the heat waves roasting hundreds of millions of people across three continents that are confirming a grim climate prophecy for many experts. Sizzling temperatures in the United States and Canada and persistent heat in parts of Europe and northern Africa are creating dangerous health conditions, aggravating droughts and fueling wildfires around the world. And it's this troubling confluence of climate threats that researchers have been warning about for two decades. ""Climate scientists were predicting exactly these kinds of things, that there would be an enhanced threat of these types of extreme events brought on by increased warming,"" said Jonathan Martin, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""It's very distressing. These are not encouraging signs for our immediate future."" While August is typically one of the hottest months in the Northern Hemisphere, this week’s heat waves add to a growing list of recent extremes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Friday that July was the hottest month since record-keeping began 142 years ago. Catastrophic flooding killed more than 200 people in Europe last month, and wildfires are raging in Siberia, across the Mediterranean and along the western coasts of the U.S. and Canada. But to many experts, these events offer just a glimpse of what lies ahead in future summers because of climate change. This week, a United Nations panel released an alarming report on the state of climate change and the consequences of further global warming. The assessment highlighted the threat of extreme weather events, including how global warming will make heat waves both more frequent and more intense. The U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that severe heat waves that previously occurred once every 50 years will now likely happen once per decade. And in a study published last month in the journal Nature Climate Change, scientists determined that record-shattering heat events are up to seven times more likely to occur between now and 2050, and more than 21 times more likely to occur from 2051 to 2080. The oppressive heat that blanketed the Pacific Northwest early this summer demonstrated how dangerous heat extremes can be. Hundreds of deaths were linked to the June heat wave, and more than 35 cities across Washington state and Oregon tied or set new temperature records. ""The heat event that we had in the Pacific Northwest in June — it's not that we're suddenly going to see that every summer, but the recent extremes are certainly a preview of what we'll see more frequently in the future,"" said Karin Bumbaco, a research scientist at the University of Washington and Washington’s assistant state climatologist. Heat waves occur when a ridge of high pressure parks over a region, suppressing cloud formation and causing air to compress and warm. The resulting heat domes have been associated with tropical cyclone activity, which can alter the circulation of air over the Northern Hemisphere and trigger unusual weather patterns. Heat waves occur naturally in the summer, but climate change is exacerbating these events because emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are causing average temperatures to increase. These changes to baseline temperatures mean that when heat waves do occur, they are more likely to be severe, said Gerald Meehl, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado. ""If average temperatures are increasing everywhere, that increases the odds of more intense heat events,"" he said. ""Even relatively small increases in average temperatures cause a much bigger shift in the extremes."" Extreme weather events, including heat waves, are driven by a complex mix of atmospheric processes and can vary from year to year, but climate change helps amplify the threats, said Philip Mote, a climate scientist at Oregon State University. Global warming can also create feedback loops that then make other extreme events more likely to occur. Droughts, for instance, can intensify heat waves because the sun can more easily heat the ground when there is less moisture in the soil to evaporate. ""Right now, we have drought conditions over half the country, so that's also playing into why we're seeing so much heat this summer,"" Bumbaco said. Yet even while climate scientists have spent the past few decades projecting the effects of global warming, Mote said the intensity and pace of changes to the planet have been surprising. ""I've been involved with climate research for 23 years, and I honestly didn't think it would get this bad this fast,"" he said. ""This isn't really news to anyone who have been studying this for a while, but it's depressing to see it coming true."" Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories.

" Rain fell for several hours at the highest point on the Greenland ice sheet last week — the first rainfall event in recorded history at a location that rarely creeps above freezing temperatures. Scientists confirmed Wednesday that rain was observed Saturday at Summit Station, a research facility that sits atop the Greenland ice sheet and is operated year-round by the National Science Foundation. It was the first report of rain at the normally frigid summit, and it marks only the third time in less than a decade that above-freezing temperatures were recorded at the Arctic research station, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. The rare rainfall caused significant melting at the summit and along the ice sheet's southeastern coast over the weekend and occurred just weeks after the region experienced a separate extensive melting event in late July. The recent warm spell adds to concerns that climate change is rapidly melting ice in the Arctic, which accelerates sea-level rise around the world. Above-freezing temperatures were recorded at Summit Station, which sits at an elevation of 10,551 feet above sea level, beginning Saturday at 5 a.m. local time. The National Snow and Ice Data Center estimated that over the course of three days 7 billion tons of rain fell over the ice sheet. ""Warm conditions and the late-season timing of the three-day melt event coupled with the rainfall led to both high melting and high runoff volumes to the ocean,"" National Snow and Ice Data Center researchers said in a statement. The rain and warmer-than-usual temperatures were caused by a region of low air pressure that settled over Baffin Island and a ridge of high pressure over southeast Greenland that pushed warm air and moisture up from the south. The melting peaked Saturday, affecting 337,000 square miles of ice, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. By Monday, the area of melted ice had returned to ""moderate levels,"" the researchers said. Greenland's sprawling 656,000-square-mile ice sheet expands and contracts as part of natural yearly variations, but global warming is causing glacial ice to melt at a rapid pace. Some climate models suggest that without aggressive climate interventions, the Arctic Ocean could be ice-free in the summers by 2050. The consequences of that would be catastrophic. If Greenland's ice sheet were to completely melt, scientists have said global sea levels could rise more than 20 feet, affecting coastal communities around the world and submerging low-lying cities such as Shanghai, Amsterdam and New York. Last week, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a blistering report on the state of climate change, saying climate change is intensifying, occurring at an accelerated pace and is already affecting every region of the planet. The assessment also found that some changes that are already playing out, such as warming oceans and rising sea levels, are “irreversible for centuries to millennia.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories.

" Bill Williams, a real estate developer on Chicago's West Side, was an early adopter of electric vehicles, at first leasing a Tesla Model S before recently upgrading to a Taycan, the first electric car made by Porsche. His motivation to drive an electric vehicle, or EV, was largely that the technological novelty intrigued him, he said, although there was another reason: ""I'm not saying I'm an environmentalist, but I do think about the Earth, and I do care about the future of the planet. So if it's not too late, I'd like to be someone who's part of the solution."" But persuading more Americans to swap vehicles that run on internal combustion engines for cleaner, battery-powered rides presents a greater challenge. And in places like Chicago, where neighborhoods of color have been combating pollutants and the ill effects of a warming world, providing access to electric cars and charging stations in historically underserved communities so residents benefit from improved air quality and health must not be overlooked, experts say. ""You can factor in the history of this country and how interstates were built right through our Black and brown neighborhoods and the harmful legacy of that,"" said Billy Davis, the general manager of JitneyEV, which advocates for electric vehicle transportation and charging stations in Bronzeville, a historically Black neighborhood of Chicago. ""Just as a matter of justice, the corrective measures to increase electrification and the benefits of that should start in those areas that are greatly impacted."" Clean air and electric vehicle advocacy groups are looking to the White House for a road map: President Joe Biden signed an executive order this month that seeks to cut carbon emissions and tackle the effects of climate change. The federal government plans to do that by working with the auto industry so that 50 percent of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. by 2030 are electric, and it is pushing automakers to slash tailpipe emissions and increase gas mileage for new vehicles through model year 2026 — nonbinding goals that go beyond what the Obama administration wanted, which were watered down by the Trump administration. Transportation vehicles, including diesel- and gas-powered cars and trucks, are the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. But the federal government's initiative must go further by guaranteeing that communities of color get the same benefits from the White House's electric vehicle targets, advocacy groups say. They said that can be done by equitably distributing charging stations in areas that would benefit from more use of electric cars and offering grants to those communities, providing car buyers with financial rebates upfront and expanding tax credits so buying vehicles is not as financially burdensome, and working with communities to support electric car-sharing programs like one in Minneapolis-St. Paul that has partnered with Somali-, Hmong- and Karen-speaking organizations. ""Climate change impacts Black and brown communities first and worst,"" said Terry Travis, a co-founder of EVNoire, a national environmental consultancy organization that advocates for diversity, equity and inclusion in the transportation sector. ""From our vantage point, there's an urgency of now. We're not talking about suburban communities where the air quality tends to be a lot better."" Changing Americans' attitudes toward electric vehicles and making them more accessible and cost-effective for car buyers is only one part of Biden's proposal. Experts say the infrastructure also needs to be firmly in place, meaning charging stations must be as common as gas stations on every corner. ""Investment to date has focused on higher-income areas, so that's a challenge here,"" said Shruti Vaidyanathan, the transportation program director for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit organization that analyzes federal energy policies. ""We need to see government investments supporting new chargers, specifically in low-income and environmental justice communities and communities of color. That's a big part of what we need to ensure that EVs are a reliable option for these residents."" A study last year by researchers at Humboldt State University in Northern California reviewed the state's census data and found ""stark disparities"" in the availability of public electric vehicle chargers across socioeconomic and ethnic groups, with Black and Latino drivers likely to have the least access. ""Public charging stations have primarily been deployed at, and more accessible to, wealthier and whiter"" communities, the study found. In Chicago, data analyzed last year by Northwestern University revealed that while electric vehicles are registered in all of the 77 community-designated areas of the city, the majority of public charging stations were in the mostly white and affluent North Side, while mostly Black and Latino communities in the South and West sides were ""charging deserts"" with no access to public charging stations. A bipartisan $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill passed by the Senate last week includes $7.5 billion for electric vehicle charging stations, only half of what Biden initially wanted in support of 500,000 new charging stations. Vaidyanathan said the White House will need to be ""much more aggressive"" not only to meet his climate targets but also ""if he expects to drive EV deployment at the scale we need."" Overall, Americans are mostly tepid about electric cars, with 39 percent of respondents in a poll in June by the Pew Research Center saying they were ""somewhat likely to seriously consider"" buying one as their next vehicle, while 46 percent said they were not too likely to consider it or would not at all. A report in 2019 by researchers from the University of California, Davis examined consumers who buy new and used electric vehicles and found that while Black and Latino car buyers account for 41 percent of gas-powered vehicle purchases, they account for only 12 percent of electric vehicle purchases. Travis, who bought his first electric vehicle — a pre-owned Nissan Leaf in 2014 — said a ""psychological shift"" among consumers could help convert more to electric vehicles. That includes not only increased visibility of charging stations in places like strip malls and parking lots but also the right kind of messaging. ""I don't look like the typical profile of an EV driver,"" said Travis, who is Black. ""So when I go on a grocery run and someone sees me get out of my car, I allocate time if they want to ask questions."" He said he fields plenty, including questions about the cost of electric vehicles (for instance, a lower-end Chevrolet Bolt can start at around $31,000, and some EV models are eligible for tax credits) to how long they take to charge (a completely drained Bolt may need about 9½ hours) to whether they can be driven in the rain (yes). ""Once you get somebody to understand what they're like, the light bulb flips on and they say, 'Why isn't everybody talking about this?'"" Travis said. Travis said his group has been engaging with students at historically Black colleges and universities and with Native American communities to help them learn about the benefits of electric vehicle technology. A smattering of cities and communities across the country have also been taking into account accessibility of electric vehicles and infrastructure in their planning. In 2020, Chicago officials passed a landmark ordinance that requires new residential construction with at least five units and onsite parking to include charging stations. Because not everyone owns a home where they can readily charge an electric vehicle, it is that forward thinking that will help change perspectives, Travis said. ""We're dealing with more than 100 years of habit with internal combustion vehicles,"" he said. ""Things won't just change overnight.""

" BOULDER CITY, Nev. — The federal government declared an unprecedented water shortage for the Colorado River and Lake Mead on Monday, triggering mandatory water cuts and opening a new chapter in the worsening struggle with drought in the West. Water supplies from the Colorado River for Arizona, Nevada and parts of Mexico will be reduced starting in January after the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, an agency of the Interior Department, issued a formal shortage declaration for the river for the first time. Although the first round of cutbacks will affect mainly farmers, sparing cities and homes in the short term, further drops in Lake Mead's water levels would trigger much deeper water reductions that could ultimately affect cities like Phoenix, Las Vegas and Tucson, Arizona, as well as parts of California. ""Like much of the West and across our connected basins, the Colorado River is facing unprecedented and accelerating challenges,"" Assistant Interior Secretary Tanya Trujillo said. Scientists say a combination of natural weather patterns and human-driven climate change is fueling the historic drought and dwindling water levels in Lake Mead and throughout the Colorado River system. Temperatures at Lake Mead hit 106 degrees Monday as a few boaters and swimmers cooled off in the lake, the country's largest reservoir. Towering above them was a tall shoreline streaked with wide, white stripes — rings left behind from just a couple of decades ago, when the water levels were more than 100 feet higher. John Entsminger, who manages the Southern Nevada Water Authority, said his region will be able to easily absorb the initial cuts because of steps that were undertaken to reduce water demand, including cracking down on water-intensive landscaping. He described the situation as ""extremely serious but not apocalyptic."" ""We have a plan for that worst-case scenario right now. We've planned for the very bad,"" Entsminger said. ""We have not planned for the absolute worst."" The water shortage declaration had been widely anticipated since May, when Lake Mead fell below 1,075 feet, the trigger point for ""Level 1"" water cuts in an agreement among states that rely on water from the Colorado River. The Bureau of Reclamation predicted Monday that in January, when the cuts take effect, water level will be at 1,066 feet. Lake Mead, which sits just above Hoover Dam, feeds the lower Colorado River basin, part of a longer Colorado River system that provides water for 40 million people and electricity for millions through hydroelectric dams that control the river's flow. Under the Level 1 cuts, Arizona will face the biggest reduction: 512,000 acre-feet, or about one-fifth of the state's allotment from the Colorado River and about 8 percent of Arizona's overall water supply. Farmers who rely on water from the Central Arizona Project canal will be most directly affected, local officials said. At a farmer's market on the outskirts of Las Vegas, farmer Lea Bales ducked under a tent for shade from the powerful heat as she hawked squash, melons and carrots from her farm in Pahrump, Nevada — the last of the season's harvest before the fall crops go in. She said she worried that future water cuts would make her way of life unsustainable. ""I probably would not have a farm,"" Bales said. ""Either that or I would just go so small-scale, just, like, for personal use. Because it takes a lot of water to grow a lot of vegetables.""

" Millions of Americans are under an extreme heat advisory recommending they avoid strenuous activity and stay well hydrated — but for some restaurants and stores, the heat wave threatens worker safety and guts traffic into stores, leading to a dramatic downturn in business. “We decided yesterday, as we were looking at the forecast and extreme heat, to close over these two days for dining,” Greg Gardner, general manager of J. Timothy’s Taverne in Plainville, Connecticut, told NBC News on Thursday. “We’ve had a bunch of these spells and witnessed the kitchen guys really taking heat from the stress of it all and stress on their bodies.” Connecticut is among 34 states across the country under a heat-related warning as temperatures soar 10 to 15 degrees above regional averages in some places. But inside kitchens, temperatures can reach 105 to 110 degrees, increasing the risk of heat exhaustion, according to the Department of Labor. A year into the pandemic and amid a shortage of workers willing to work in the restaurant industry, Gardner said he’d rather lose sales than lose staff. “Of course there’s a financial hit — you’re talking about two days of revenue,” he said. “But a bigger hit for us would be working the guys in an untenable situation and losing the guys we do have because there is no one to replace them… They are the heart of what we do.” National demand for air conditioners is up 21 percent this week. Hot coffee is down by 2 percent and lawn mowers by 3 percent. One restaurant in Portland, Oregon, told social media followers it closed Thursday “to keep you and our crew safe during this incredible heat wave.” A coffee shop in Tewksbury, Massachusetts, said it will be closed for a second day Friday because of the heat. A pizza place in Junction, Vermont, said it will remain closed Friday because of the heat. “The hotter it gets, the more it’s about need-based shopping,” said Evan Gold, executive vice president of the weather intelligence firm Planalytics. “So, discretionary places tend to take a hit and need-based businesses go up."" Weather-driven demand across the country has spiked by 21 percent for air conditioners this week compared to an average week, according to Planalytics. Demand for fans increased 15 percent and water toy demand is up 10 percent, according to the firm. Demand for hot coffee fell by 2 percent and lawn mowers by 3 percent. While hot weather might be good news for the cooling unit industry, it strikes another blow at the already struggling restaurant industry. The pandemic led to the closure of more than 110,000 restaurants last year and nearly 2.5 million jobs were lost, compared to pre-pandemic levels, according to the National Restaurant Association. Restaurant and food service industry sales also fell $240 billion below 2020 projections. “If we want to survive and come through this thing we need to get people back to work,” Gardner said. Workers with J.Timothy’s Taverne all make anywhere between $17 and $25 an hour, he said. The restaurant is just breaking even because of the rising cost of labor, shorter hours and higher price of goods, including chicken wings which make up about half of the restaurant’s food sales. The extreme weather in Northwestern areas like Portland have added to the mounting financial pressures on businesses in the food industry. Erica Montgomery, who runs a food cart called Erica’s Soul Food, told NBC News she stayed home Thursday because of the heat. A few weeks ago Montgomery worked out of her food cart as temperatures in the city rose to 116 degrees. But after that experience, she said she’d rather lose a day in sales than risk her health. “I tried to be open during the first part of that [heat wave] but honestly I felt like I was going to die,” said Montgomery, who makes about $1,000 a day running a food cart. “I couldn't think straight.” Montgomery, who is a single mom, said her food business is her only source of income. During the July heat wave, her neighborhood lost power, spoiling all of her products. Earlier in the year when Oregon was gripped by an icy storm, she lost power again and was forced to toss out her food. She’s now considering buying a generator and A/C unit for the cart. “This is the first time I’ve sat out of work because of the heat,” she said. “It’s become kind of an uncontrollable obstacle.” Breaking news emails Be the first to know about breaking news and other NBC News reports.

" ALGIERS — Wildfires tearing through forested areas of northern Algeria have killed at least 65 people, state television reported on Wednesday, as some of the most destructive blazes in the country's history continued to rage. The government has deployed the army to help fight the fires, which have burnt most fiercely in the mountainous Kabylie region, and 28 of the dead are soldiers, with another 12 critically injured with burns. President Abdelmadjid Tebboune declared three days of national mourning for the dead and froze state activities not related to the fires. Forest fires have set large parts of Algeria, Turkey and Greece aflame over the past week and a European Union atmosphere monitor said the Mediterranean had become a wildfire hotspot aided by increasingly hot weather. Dozens of separate fires have raged through forest areas across northern Algeria since Monday and on Tuesday Interior Minister Kamel Beldjoud accused arsonists of igniting the flames, without providing any evidence. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics The worst hit area has been Tizi Ouzou, the largest district of the Kabylie region, where houses have burned and residents fled to shelter in hotels, hostels and university accommodation in nearby towns. The government has said it will compensate those affected. Last week, a European Union atmosphere monitor said the Mediterranean had become a wildfire hotspot as massive blazes engulfed forests in Turkey and Greece, aided by a heatwave. Residents of the Tizi Ouzou region in Kabylie used tree branches to try to smother burning patches of forest or hurled water from plastic containers in a desperate effort to douse the fire. The soldiers were killed in different areas, some while trying to extinguish the flames and others after they were cut off by the spreading fire, Kabylie residents said. The Defense Ministry said more soldiers had been badly injured with burns. Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories."
" Island nations across the world are warning that they face catastrophic consequences of rising sea levels and possible extinction, after a landmark U.N. report warned of the effects of a warming world. An alliance of 39 coastal and low-lying nations said the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report was a ""major alert for the world"" and called on more powerful countries to do all they can to keep global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius to ""save lives and livelihoods."" ""We have to turn this around,"" Diann Black-Layne, the lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States, said in a statement Monday after the IPCC report was released. ""The IPCC confirms the experience of small island states: that cyclones are getting more intense, and that sea levels are rising, but it also confirms we can still curb the worst of it."" Keeping temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) instead of 2 degrees Celsius, a target of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, would avoid a long-term rise of three meters (9.6 feet), she said. ""That is our very future, right there,"" she said. The IPCC report, released Monday, warned that while warming could be stopped by halting carbon emissions, sea levels would continue to rise even in a best-case scenario, putting coastal communities at risk of flooding and destruction. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics The Alliance of Small Island States represents countries across the world, including Singapore, Seychelles, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Dominican Republic, Cuba, the Bahamas and Belize. So concerned is the remote nation of Kiribati in the Pacific, made up of three low-lying archipelagos that at their tallest stand no more than 6 feet above sea level, that plans have been made to physically raise its islands above the sea, in partnership with China. A rise of just 3 feet could submerge as much as two thirds of Kiribati by the end of this century, the IPCC has said. Mohamed Nasheed, president of the Maldives, one of the world's lowest-lying countries, which has for years campaigned for climate action, said the situation could not be more serious. ""This report is devastating news for the most climate-vulnerable countries like the Maldives. It confirms we are on the edge of extinction. Climate emergency is intensifying, we are on the front lines. Our nations are already battered by extreme climate,"" he said on Twitter. Kimberly Nicholas, a professor and climate and sustainability expert at Lund University in Sweden who has acted as an observer at two global climate summits, said the Maldivian president was right in his assessment. ""I think it’s probably fair. That’s how I would feel if I lived in one of those low-lying island nations,"" she told NBC News. ""Humans do have the power to stop warming pretty quickly and that’s good news. When we stop adding carbon pollution we expect warming to stop. ""But there are things such as sea level rise that are not reversible. The report says the sea level is committed to rise, due to continuing warming of the deep ocean and ice sheet melts,"" Nicholas said. Joseph Moeno-Kolio, head of the Pacific region for the environmental activist group Greenpeace, blamed Australia — a major carbon emitter and exporter of fossil fuels — for exacerbating the crisis for neighboring islands. “Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison met last week with Pacific leaders and committed to supporting the Pacific family,"" he said in a statement. ""This report has found that if Morrison’s obsession with fossil fuels isn’t immediately ended, these words might one day be nothing more than an empty lament on the family tomb."" Climate change is largely caused by big, prosperous nations while smaller coastal countries tend to be much poorer. Nicholas warned this disparity would see those that pollute the least suffer the most. “It’s really clear how unfair climate change is,"" she said. ""It’s primarily caused by burning fossil fuels, and it’s a few countries and individuals within countries who burned the majority of it and enjoyed the benefits they provided. “The majority of the world has not burned much carbon at all and is suffering the worst impact. That equity dynamic is so important to keep in mind.” Speaking at a news conference Tuesday, Morrison accepted that his country had a part to play in reducing climate change, but defended Australia's record and said carbon emissions had dipped 20 percent since 2005. He argued that the developing world accounted for two thirds of carbon emissions and that China's output was ""more than the OECD combined."" ""The emissions keep going up because of the choices that [developing nations] will necessarily make. And, so, what's important is that we ensure that the technology breakthroughs that are necessary to transform the world over the next 10, 20 and 30 years are realized,"" he said.

" Wildfires raging across Greece's second largest island for a seventh day, forcing thousands to flee their homes, are the direct result of climate change, a global consortium of weather and climate experts said on Monday. The Greek coastguard has evacuated more than 2,000 people from Evia, a popular vacation destination northeast of Athens, since fires broke out there last Tuesday, a spokesperson told the Associated Press. Firefighters from more than 20 European countries are on Evia to help authorities stop the progress of the fires, which are destroying acres of tinder-dry forests and some homes. The World Meteorological Organization said that the fires, which have blocked out the sun amid the hottest weather Greece has seen for 30 years, are part of a chain of extreme weather caused by climate change as a result of human behavior. Its secretary-general, Prof. Petteri Taalas, released a statement after the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a landmark report warning that climate change was accelerating and in some ways irreversible. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics ""The harsh reality of climate change is playing out in real time before our very eyes,"" said Taalas. ""It is a foretaste of what faces future generations. Some of the negative changes are already locked into the climate system but others still can be addressed if we make strong, rapid and sustained reductions in emissions now."" Temperatures have reached 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) across Greece for the last few days. Other big fires have been burning forests and farmland in the southern Greek region of the Peloponnese, while a major blaze that burned through homes, businesses and forests on the northern fringes of Athens was on the wane, authorities there said. Fires have also been raging in neighboring Turkey for the last 10 days. The IPPC's report predicts long-term temperatures will rise across the globe, with a rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) enough to trigger more heatwaves, floods and droughts. A rise of 2 degrees (3.6 Fahrenheit) could see agricultural and health systems fail across the world, the report said. Taalas was in no doubt that extreme weather events and fires in Europe and across the world were connected. ""The extreme heat we have witnessed in 2021 bears all the hallmarks of human-induced climate change... Fires in North America stoked by heat and drought have sent plumes of smoke across the Atlantic,"" he said. ""In recent days, we have seen devastating fires in Turkey and Greece amid an intense and long-lasting heatwave in the Mediterranean. Siberia — a region traditionally associated with permafrost — has once again seen huge wildfires after exceptional heatwaves, fires and low Arctic sea ice in 2020."" The WMO, a U.N. agency based in Geneva, Switzerland, established the IPCC alongside the U.N Environment Programme in 1988. For some on Evia, international assistance may be in vain. ""It’s already too late, the area has been destroyed,"" Giannis Kontzias, mayor of the northern Evia municipality of Istiaia, told Greece’s Open TV Sunday night. In dramatic scenes Sunday afternoon, fast-moving flames encroached on the seaside village of Pefki on the island's northern coast, burning trees on the fringes and setting at least one house on fire, the Associated Press reported. Panicked residents raced with water tanks, hoses and branches in a seemingly futile effort to extinguish the flames.

" PAGE, Ariz. — A thick, white band of newly exposed rock face stretches high above boaters’ heads at Lake Powell, creating a sharp contrast against the famous red desert terrain as their vessels weave through tight canyons that were once underwater. It’s a stark reminder of how far the water level has fallen at the massive reservoir on the Utah-Arizona border. Just last year, it was more than 50 feet (15 meters) higher. Now, the level at the popular destination for houseboat vacations is at a historic low amid a climate change-fueled megadrought engulfing the U.S. West. At Lake Powell, tents are tucked along shorelines that haven’t seen water for years. Bright-colored jet-skis fly across the water, passing kayakers, water-skiers and fishermen under a blistering desert sun. Closed boat ramps have forced some houseboats off the lake, leaving tourists and businesses scrambling. One ramp is so far above the water, people have to carry kayaks and stand-up paddleboards down a steep cliff face to reach the surface. Houseboat-rental companies have had to cancel their bookings through August — one of their most popular months — after the National Park Service, which manages the lake, barred people from launching the vessels in mid-July. At the popular main launch point on Wahweap Bay, the bottom of the concrete ramp has been extended with steel pipes so boats can still get on the lake, but that solution will only last another week or two, the park service said. “It’s really sad that they’re allowing such a beautiful, beautiful place to fall apart,” said Bob Reed, who runs touring company Up Lake Adventures. Lake Powell is the second-largest reservoir in the United States, right behind Nevada’s Lake Mead, which also stores water from the Colorado River. Both are shrinking faster than expected, a dire concern for a seven-state region that relies on the river to supply water to 40 million people and a $5 billion-a-year agricultural industry. They are among several large bodies of water in the U.S. West that have hit record lows this summer, including the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Lake Oroville in California is expected to reach a historic low by late August, with the state’s more than 1,500 reservoirs 50 pecent lower than they should be this time of year. In 1983, Lake Powell’s water exceeded its maximum level of 3,700 feet (1,127 meters) and nearly overran Glen Canyon Dam. The lake is facing a new set of challenges having reached a record low of 3,553 feet (1,082 meters) last week. Government officials had to begin releasing water from sources upstream last month to keep the lake’s level from dropping so low it would have threatened hydropower supplied by the dam. It comes as less snowpack flows into the Colorado River and its tributaries, and hot temperatures parch soil and cause more river water to evaporate as it streams through the drought-plagued American West. Studies have linked the region’s more than 20-year megadrought to human-caused climate change. Fluctuating water levels have long been a staple of Lake Powell, but National Park Service officials say the usual forecasts weren’t able to predict just how bad 2021 would be. Finger-pointing has started as boaters, local officials and the park service debate what to do now. “The park service has failed to plan,” area homeowner Bill Schneider said. “If it gets to the point where we’re so low that you can’t put boats in the water and you can’t come up with a solution to put boats in the water, why would you come to Lake Powell?” The 53-year-old bought a retirement home in nearby Page, Arizona, after completing 25 years of military service in February. He wanted to return to Wahweap Bay where he spent most of his childhood and teen years fishing, waterskiing and working odd jobs around the lake. But after watching how the lake has been managed, Schneider says he’s starting to regret it. Officials say they have solutions for families and boaters who sometimes plan years ahead to explore the glassy waters that extend into narrow red rock canyons and the tourism industry that depends on them. Once the severity of the drought became clear, federal officials began looking for options to allow boat access at low water levels, said William Shott, superintendent of the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, where Lake Powell is located. The park service discovered an old ramp on Wahweap Bay that will be built out to support houseboats and smaller motorboats. Shott says he hopes the $3 million ramp can be completed by Labor Day weekend. The project is funded by the park service and lake concessionaire Aramark. The agency and officials from the town of Page, which relies on lake tourism, plan to open another old asphalt ramp to provide access for smaller boats while the larger one is updated. Tom Materna, who has been visiting Lake Powell for 20 years, launched his family’s 65-foot (20-meter) timeshare houseboat just hours before the main ramp closed but had to cut their vacation short as water levels dropped in mid-July. “They said no more launching out of the Wahweap ramp, so we were glad we made it out,” the Los Angeles resident said. “Then the next day I think or two days later, they called us up and told us that all launch and retrieve houseboats had to be off the lake.” Page Mayor Bill Diak said losing boat access to the lake could have devastating financial consequences for the city of 7,500. He said local leaders were “slow” to address dropping water levels and limited boat access but that he’s been working closer with park officials and concessionaires on solutions. “We could have been a little bit more proactive on planning … but we’re moving in the right direction now working together,” Diak said. He stressed that the impact of climate change needs to be addressed, noting that the U.S. West could be facing far more pressing issues than lake access if the drought continues for another 20 years. One silver lining, Shott says, is the park service can build boat ramps that are usable even during record drought years. Over $8 million in other low-water projects also are underway. “Even if we did have a crystal ball and we saw that these lake levels were going to get this low, we couldn’t have prevented it anyways,” Shott said. “With that said, we’re taking advantage of the low water now.” Troy Sherman, co-owner of a business renting environmentally friendly anchors to houseboats, said the marina housing Beach Bags Anchors shut down shortly after his company launched in spring 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. It relaunched this year but had to cancel 95 percent of its bookings in July when ramps closed to houseboats. “Until there’s really access to a ramp again to put houseboats in, my business is kind of in a holding pattern,” Sherman said. “But we’ll totally persevere; it’s what you have to do.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories."
" Mateo Jaramillo sees the future of renewable energy in thousands of iron pellets rusting away in a laboratory in Somerville, Massachusetts.  Jaramillo is chief executive of Form Energy, a company that recently announced what it says is a breakthrough in a global race: how to store renewable energy for long periods of time.  Traces of rust on iron have been a sign of decay for thousands of years. But now this chemical process — the oxidation of iron into iron oxide — forms the basis of a battery that Jaramillo said could offer a way to store energy on power grids for more than 100 hours, but at about one-tenth of the cost of an equivalent facility powered by lithium-ion batteries, the leading battery technology. “Lithium-ion today is very cost-effective at providing energy storage for a few hours,” Jaramillo, who used to work on stationary energy storage for the electric car company Tesla, said. “But forecasting out into the future and looking at how the grid operates, we need to be able to bridge hundreds of hours.” The batteries discharge energy from pellets of iron as they “rust” or oxidize in oxygen from the air; the reverse chemical process — effectively “de-rusting” — then uses electric current to convert the rust back into pure iron. Each iron-air battery is about the size of a dishwasher, and  thousands of such batteries could be placed together in a very large building to store megawatts of renewable electricity on the grid until it’s needed. Form Energy is far from the only company trying to solve this problem. Renewable wind and solar energy now make up about 10 percent of the electricity used in the United States. But sometimes the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow, and today’s power grid doesn’t have a lot of storage. Fossil fuels like gas and coal, which environmentalists hope to eliminate as energy sources, can supply power to the grid in just a few seconds and don’t have such shortcomings; it’s hoped that grid-scale storage can replace at least some of that “on-demand” need for electricity.  “Cost-effective, durable and reliable energy storage opens up whole new areas of possibility for grid decarbonization,” said Costa Samaras, an associate professor of environmental engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh who studies efforts to create a power grid with effectively no carbon emissions. “It reduces the stress on the grid during peak times, and it stores renewable energy in the times where you have a lot of it to the times where you don’t.” That might be from minute to minute — when a cloud passes in front of the sun, for instance — or at different hours of the day, such as when there’s no wind during the times of peak demand for electricity in the afternoons and evenings. Short-term demands can now be met relatively cheaply thanks to grid-scale installations of lithium-ion batteries such as the 250-megawatt Gateway Energy Storage facility in California.  Although the costs of large “Li-ion” installations have dramatically dropped in recent years, they become expensive when they are designed to last more than 10 hours or so. Renewable energy advocates have pushed for investment in new technologies to enable renewables for the demands of a modern power grid. Although the chemistry behind iron-air batteries isn’t new, they’ve been overlooked because they are too heavy to be portable. Form Energy said its proprietary technology for extracting oxygen from the air through a membrane makes the chemistry feasible for stationary storage, and at a much lower cost than equivalent lithium-ion facilities. They’re also safe and made from abundant ingredients — unlike lithium-ion batteries that need plentiful supplies of hard-to-get lithium. Form Energy said its iron-air battery facilities will cost about $20 per kilowatt-hour, falling to about $10 per kilowatt-hour by the end of the decade. By way of comparison, grid-scale lithium-ion facilities cost between $250 and $300 per kilowatt-hour, Jaramillo said. The company is now working with a utility in Minnesota on a 1-megawatt storage facility that will be completed in about two years, but after 2025, “we will scale pretty quickly into the tens and subsequently hundreds of megawatts, which is the sort of scale you have to be to really make a difference on the grid,” he said. Iron-air batteries are just one of many ideas for grid-scale storage, according to Chris Knittel, a professor of applied economics who directs the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research. Others include using spare electricity to pump compressed air into underground salt caverns, then to power turbines when the electricity is needed, or using the electricity to make ammonia, which can be stored and then used in fuel cells to extract the energy.  “There are even ideas of using electricity when it’s cheap to drive a train up a hill, park it and then to use it to generate electricity as it comes down,” he said. Some areas are blessed with hydroelectric schemes that can store electricity as “pumped hydro” by pumping water uphill into a reservoir, for example, and using it later to drive turbines, but many regions will need large-scale battery storage to support renewable electricity sources like solar and wind, he said. Existing methods of generating electricity at short notice, mainly by burning fossil fuels like natural gas, have so far managed to smooth out the intermittent supplies from renewables, but not for much longer. “We’re all trying to think about a system where there is no natural gas,” Knittel said. “In that world, batteries are going to become important, or necessary.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories.

" The Atlantic Ocean’s current system, an engine of the Northern Hemsiphere’s climate, could be weakening to such an extent that it could soon bring big changes to the world’s weather, a scientific study said on Thursday. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a large system of ocean currents that transports warm water from the tropics northwards into the North Atlantic. As the atmosphere warms due to increased greenhouse gas emissions, the surface ocean beneath retains more of heat. A potential collapse of the system could have severe consequences for the world’s weather systems. Climate models have shown that the AMOC is at its weakest in more than a 1,000 years. However, it has not been known whether the weakening is due to a change in circulation or it is to do with the loss of stability. The study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, said the difference is crucial. “The loss of dynamical stability would imply that the AMOC has approached its critical threshold, beyond which a substantial and in practice likely irreversible transition to the weak mode could occur,” said Niklas Boers at the Potstdam Insitute for Climate Impact Research and author of the study. By analyzing the sea-surface temperature and salinity patterns of the Atlantic Ocean, the study said the weakening of the last century is likely to be associated with a loss of stability. “The findings support the assessment that the AMOC decline is not just a fluctuation or a linear response to increasing temperatures but likely means the approaching of a critical threshold beyond which the circulation system could collapse,” Boers said. If the AMOC collapsed, it would increase cooling of the Northern Hemisphere, sea level rise in the Atlantic, an overall fall in precipitation over Europe and North America and a shift in monsoons in South America and Afrcia, Britain’s Met Office said. Other climate models have said the AMOC will weaken over the coming century but that a collapse before 2100 is unlikely. Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories."
" Manhattanite David D’Alessio spent a recent Saturday cobbling together a shelter out of muddy leaves and twigs in a wooded stretch 75 miles north of New York City. While the wilderness training on the 90-acre grounds of the Mountain Scout Survival School has traditionally attracted outdoor enthusiasts, the musician was among several of the 18 attendees who weren’t learning to drink water out of a vine or set traps for rabbits just for fun. Those are skills D’Alessio, 49, the father of a 6-year-old girl, fears will become essential in the coming years — as the impacts of climate change continue to worsen. “It’s an inevitability that we’ll be facing a crisis within our lifetime, within my lifetime and certainly within my daughter’s lifetime,” he said. Survivalist school instructors across the country say there has been an increasing interest in their wilderness and urban-disaster preparedness courses from Americans worried about climate change. As rising temperatures bring more wildfires, droughts and destructive storms, those types of courses are no longer the domain of campers and hunters. One of these schools' fastest-growing demographics is now young families. “It was never like that before,” said Shane Hobel, founder of the Mountain Scout Survival School. While the costs of survival school training vary across the country depending on levels and duration, Hobel charges $125 per person, $230 per couple and $460 per family for his Wilderness 1 class. It's hard to measure the depth of the trend as there's no industry trade association tabulating statistics across the country. But Hobel estimated that increased interest in his courses is fueled by ""50 percent climate change and 50 percent the 'political stuff.'"" Whichever their particular nightmare scenario, there is a shared concern among some of his clientele that the foundation on which modern society rests is increasingly fragile. “If something breaks down, if the grid drops out, all of this modern technology fails us instantaneously,” said Hobel, who leans into traditional Native American philosophies. “Very few people in the country are foraging and hunting each day, but there is no other technology that’s going to save you. These skills will keep you alive — period.” That sort of rhetoric may sound alarmist, but there are some ominous clouds on the horizon. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has forecast a temperature rise of 2.5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century. Some scientists consider even that a conservative estimation. As temperatures rise, so do the repercussions. “What we’re seeing through these impacts is what climate change is going to do: the drought out West, the forest fires out West, the heat wave that we’re experiencing, the hurricanes that are getting stronger and moving differently, the hurricane seasons that are extending in length,” said Jason Smerdon, a professor at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University. “All of these things have strong climate change fingerprints. And this is very much the kind of things we can expect more of moving forward,” Smerdon said. Travis Johnson, founder and senior survival skills instructor at Northwest Survival School in Ione, Washington, doesn’t need to imagine those future scenarios. He can smell it. Taking a batch of students into the mountains for advanced training last month, Johnson said they would be hit with the stench of the wildfires plaguing other parts of Washington as they descended to base camp. Johnson said he’s had a 60 percent increase in enrollment this year over previous years, and the 25-year veteran of the craft credited that influx to climate change. “This year it’s been people that you wouldn’t normally expect who do it because they’ve never been interested in the outdoors,” Johnson said. “We’re getting a lot more family groups, instead of just fathers and sons, because they want everybody in the group to have these preparedness skills whether for urban [environments] or wilderness.” There is increasing pessimism about what the quality of life will be like for the next generation. Among the students enrolled in Hobel’s Wilderness 1 class on the day NBC News attended were three children under the age of 9. Kavita Pawria-Sanchez, 44, a lawyer from Brooklyn, New York, watched her 7-year-old daughter, Sahira, become mesmerized as Hobel started a fire with embers from a stick rubbed down on a wooden board, using fibers from cedar bark as tinder and twigs as kindling. “[My husband and I] want to be totally sure that she is prepared for world climate calamities,” Pawria-Sanchez said. “Things are going to happen. They’re already happening. “I don’t even think it’s just specific skills. It’s a mindset, philosophy and values that she will need.” Smerdon is skeptical that training to survive in the wilderness is the best way to prepare for the looming crisis. A better investment of time and energy to him would be lobbying local, state and national leaders to put forth more resources and policies that could help mitigate the impact of climate change. ""It's counter to what is actually most effective in light of impacts of climate change, which is having prepared and resilient and connected communities,"" Smerdon said of the impulse to live off the grid. It is increasingly likely, however, that periodic disasters will force city dwellers to at least temporarily evacuate their homes, which is why urban-preparedness courses at survival school are becoming particularly popular. ""That’s something that comes up in urban classes — especially in wildfire-prone areas out West,"" said Tony Nester, head instructor at Ancient Pathways, which teaches desert and wilderness survival in Arizona and Colorado Springs, Colorado. ""We talk about it. What plans do you have in place? How do I get my family evacuated? Where do we go? What supplies should we have with us? How do we get out of our house in 15 minutes? How do we get across town to get to our kids? We’re discussing those issues more and more."" Those courses include teachings on a range of subjects, including pre-disaster planning for family rendezvous points, preparing a ""bail-out bag,"" water purification and roadside survival. Nester knows the concerns firsthand: Before he moved to Colorado two years ago, his family was forced to evacuate their home in Flagstaff, Arizona, eight summers in a row because of wildfires. In the Northeast, there are different reasons to study similar tactics. ""The biggest wakeup call for New Yorkers was Hurricane Sandy, because of the storm surge,"" said Hobel, who teaches occasional urban-preparedness courses himself in the city. ""The saddest thing about Americans is that they wait until something happens before they take steps to get the skills, to get the gear, so they can be prepared for the next time. ""The secret to this is not to be reactive; the secret is to be proactive."" On the day D'Alessio underwent his wilderness training, he managed to convince his less enthused wife, Jennifer Blodgett, to tag along. ""He’ll say something like, 'We have to get ready. We live in Manhattan. If something were to happen, where would we go? How would we live off the land if we had to, if you can’t go to the grocery store anymore?'"" said Blodgett, 35, a hotel worker. ""I wouldn’t survive, but I’m kind of OK with that for myself. I'm more worried about my daughter's [generation]."" At the very least, D’Alessio said he gained confidence from his first foray into wilderness survival training. ""Now I feel like, 'Oh, my God, I can set up a mud hut,'"" said D’Alessio, who is planning future daddy-daughter excursions to the Mountain Scout Survival School. ""I can whack my way through getting some water in the forest. Stuff like that. If I really do get in a pinch, there’s a knowledge base that’s emerging and evolving."" “It’s definitely something I’m going to continue doing.” Breaking news emails Be the first to know about breaking news and other NBC News reports.

" Baby salmon are dying by the thousands in one California river, and an entire run of endangered salmon could be wiped out in another. Fishermen who make their living off adult salmon, once they enter the Pacific Ocean, are sounding the alarm as blistering heat waves and extended drought in the U.S. West raise water temperatures and imperil fish from Idaho to California. Hundreds of thousands of young salmon are dying in Northern California’s Klamath River as low water levels brought about by drought allow a parasite to thrive, devastating a Native American tribe whose diet and traditions are tied to the fish. And wildlife officials said the Sacramento River is facing a “near-complete loss” of young Chinook salmon due to abnormally warm water. A crash in one year’s class of young salmon can have lasting effects on the total population and shorten or stop the fishing season, a growing concern as climate change continues to make the West hotter and drier. That could be devastating to the commercial salmon fishing industry, which in California alone is worth $1.4 billion. The plummeting catch already has led to skyrocketing retail prices for salmon, hurting customers who say they can no longer afford the $35 per pound of fish, said Mike Hudson, who has spent the last 25 years catching and selling salmon at farmers markets in Berkeley. Hudson said he has considered retiring and selling his 40-foot (12-meter) boat because “it’s going to get worse from here.” Winter-run Chinook salmon are born in the Sacramento River, traverse hundreds of miles to the Pacific, where they normally spend three years before returning to their birthplace to mate and lay their eggs between April and August. Unlike the fall-run Chinook that survives almost entirely due to hatchery breeding programs, the winter run is still largely reared in the wild. Federal fisheries officials predicted in May that more than 80 percent of baby salmon could die because of warmer water in the Sacramento River. Now, state wildlife officials say that number could be higher amid a rapidly depleting pool of cool water in Lake Shasta. California’s largest reservoir is filled to only about 35 percent capacity, federal water managers said this week. “The pain we’re going to feel is a few years from now, when there will be no naturally spawned salmon out in the ocean,” said John McManus, executive director of the Golden State Salmon Association, which represents the fishing industry. When Lake Shasta was formed in the 1940s, it blocked access to the cool mountain streams where fish traditionally spawned. To ensure their survival, the U.S. government is required to maintain river temperatures below 56 degrees Fahrenheit (13 Celsius) in spawning habitat because salmon eggs generally can’t withstand anything warmer. The warm water is starting to affect older fish, too. Scientists have seen some adult fish dying before they can lay their eggs. “An extreme set of cascading climate events is pushing us into this crisis situation,” said Jordan Traverso, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Wildlife and Fish. The West has been grappling with a historic drought and recent heat waves worsened by climate change, stressing waterways and reservoirs that sustain millions of people and wildlife. As a result, the state has been trucking millions of salmon raised at hatcheries to the ocean each year, bypassing the perilous downstream journey. State and federal hatcheries take other extraordinary measures to preserve the decimated salmon stocks, such as maintaining a genetic bank to prevent inbreeding at hatcheries and releasing them at critical life stages, when they can recognize and return to the water where they were born. Fishermen and environmental groups blame water agencies for diverting too much water too soon to farms, which could lead to severe salmon die-off and drive the species closer to extinction. “We know that climate change is going to make years like this more common, and what the agencies should be doing is managing for the worst-case scenario,” said Sam Mace, a director of Save Our Wild Salmon, a coalition working to restore wild salmon and steelhead in the Pacific Northwest. “We need some real changes in how rivers are managed if they’re going to survive,” she added. On the Klamath River near the Oregon state line, California wildlife officials decided not to release more than 1 million young Chinook salmon into the wild and instead drove them to hatcheries that could host them until river conditions improve. Much is riding on this class of salmon because it could be the first to return to the river if plans to remove four of six dams on the Klamath and restore fish access to the upper river go according to plan. Across the West, officials are struggling with the similar concerns over fish populations. In Idaho, officials recognized that endangered sockeye salmon wouldn’t make their upstream migration through hundreds of miles of warm water to their spawning habitat, so they flooded the Snake River with cool water, then trapped and trucked the fish to hatcheries. And environmentalists went to court this month in Portland, Oregon, to try to force dam operators on the Snake and Columbia rivers to release more water at dams blocking migrating salmon, arguing that the effects of climate change and a recent heat wave were further threatening fish already on the verge of extinction. Low water levels are also affecting recreational fishing. Officials in Wyoming, Colorado, Montana and California are asking anglers to fish during the coolest parts of the day to minimize the impact on fish stressed from low-oxygen levels in warm water. Scientists say the salmon population in California historically has rebounded after a drought because they have evolved to tolerate the Mediterranean-like climate and benefited from rainy, wet years. But an extended drought could lead to extinction of certain runs of salmon. “We’re at the point where I’m not sure drought is appropriate term to describe what’s happening,” said Andrew Rypel, a fish ecologist at the University of California, Davis. He said the West is transitioning to an increasingly water-scarce environment. Hudson, the fisherman, said he used to spend days at sea when the salmon season was longer and could catch 100 fish per day. This year, he said he was lucky to catch 80 to sell at the market. “Retiring would be the smart thing to do, but I can’t bring myself to do it because these fish have been so good to us for all these years,” Hudson said. “I can’t just walk away from it.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories."
" Jeff Bezos flew to the edge of space and said he came back a changed man. The billionaire founder of Amazon earned his astronaut wings Tuesday after launching aboard a rocket and capsule developed by Blue Origin, his private spaceflight company. The historic launch was the first unpiloted suborbital flight with all civilian passengers, and the first crewed flight of Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket. But it was also the culmination of a lifelong dream for Bezos. ""It's amazing. There are no words,"" he told NBC's Stephanie Ruhle in his first post-launch interview. ""I'm not talented enough to put this into words."" The entrepreneur spoke about how seeing Earth from suborbital space changed his perspective. ""When you look at the planet, there are no borders,"" Bezos said. ""It’s one planet, and we share it and it's fragile."" He added that the journey reinforced his commitment to solving climate change, saying that investing in space technologies could help future generations. ""We have to build a road to space so that our kids and their kids can build a future,"" Bezos said. ""We live on this beautiful planet. You can’t imagine how thin the atmosphere is when you see it from space."" In particular, he stressed the need for reusable rockets for space launches and added that polluting industries could be moved to space in order to preserve the environment on Earth. ""That's going to take decades and decades to achieve, but big things start with small steps,"" he said. Bezos' flight was a suborbital jaunt, which means he and his fellow crew members didn’t actually enter into orbit around Earth. Rather, the capsule reached the edge of space, at an altitude of more than 65 miles, where the passengers experienced roughly four minutes of weightlessness. Bezos flew alongside his brother, Mark, and 82-year-old Wally Funk, a pioneering former test pilot who underwent training in the 1960s to demonstrate that women could qualify for NASA's astronaut corps. Funk, whose launch was 60 years in the making, is now the oldest person to reach space. Dutch teenager Oliver Daemen, 18, rounded out the four-person crew and set his own milestone, becoming the youngest astronaut. Bezos described the experience, recalling the feeling of being pushed back into his seat as the rocket accelerated off the launch pad and then suddenly floating during weightlessness. Mark Bezos called the experience ""a perfect flight"" and called being in weightlessness ""surprisingly natural."" Blue Origin is hoping to begin operational flights with paying customers in the near future. And while Bezos said he wants to launch other passengers first, the Amazon founder said he's enthusiastic to fly again. ""I'm going to save seats for others,"" he said, ""but I do want to go again.""

" Sharon Louis worries that her Chicago neighborhood on the city’s South Side is on borrowed time. Waves from Lake Michigan batter apartments along the coastline. Sinkholes from erosion pockmark the predominantly Black and working-class community’s streets. One crater, Louis recalled, opened up next to a streetlight. While Louis and her neighbors press for solutions, one family whose windows were shattered by the waves last year has since built its own fortress of rocks, sand bags and concrete. “If they didn’t do the work, they wouldn’t exist,” Louis, an activist with the advocacy group Black Chicago Water Council, said of her neighbors. “That’s how dire the situation is.” To better protect the residents, Chicago applied to a new Federal Emergency Management Agency program designed to help communities prepare before natural disasters hit. The city hoped to receive $851,250 to build a stone barrier along South Shore Drive. But residents and environmental advocates were disappointed to learn this month that FEMA had not chosen their project, leaving the construction of the barrier in limbo. (Chicago’s Department of Transportation will explore other options to protect the coast, a spokesman said, but the timing is unclear.) “I don’t know how it could be a lot more dramatic than waves crashing into someone’s living room, or a high-rise on the brink,” said Naomi Davis, founder of Blacks in Green, a Chicago-based environmental advocacy group, who supported the grant. “I don’t know what could be more urgent than that.” Nearly 1,000 local governments applied for FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which recently announced the 406 expected recipients of its first wave of $500 million in grant funding. (Final decisions on awards will be made in September.) Interest far outstripped the available money, and many communities are set to receive nothing. Three of the wealthiest states — California, New Jersey and Washington — are on track to receive more than half of the money, for initiatives including flood mitigation, a tsunami shelter and the removal of dense undergrowth to prevent wildfires. Plenty of poorer communities will receive funding as well, but dozens will not, including Amazonia, Missouri, with a population of just over 300, which wanted to protect critical equipment for its sewer system from rising waters, and Wilson, North Carolina, which hoped to move public housing away from areas at risk of flooding. The long list of more than 500 communities that received no funding — many without the resources to prepare for extreme weather on their own — has raised concerns among environmental justice and civil rights advocates that better resourced communities won big, while disadvantaged areas remain in need. In some cases, that’s because poorer communities don’t have the money for the matching part of the grant, or lack the resources to prepare a competitive grant application. The consequences of climate change are particularly pernicious for the poor and communities of color. Black, Latino and low-income families are more likely to live in flood zones, researchers have found. The nation’s wealth gap means their neighborhoods are less likely to have money to harden infrastructure and homes in advance of natural disasters, and the recovery is unequal as well. An investigation of FEMA’s data by NPR shows that affluent survivors are more likely to receive help. As disappointed officials learn why their projects were turned down, some advocates are questioning whether the agency ’s long-criticized disparities in disaster assistance are at risk of being repeated in a program meant to buttress communities before disasters happen. Jacqueline Patterson, the recently retired director of the NAACP’s Environmental and Climate Justice Program, said FEMA needs to be aggressive about reaching towns and cities that are particularly vulnerable. “Communities don’t have the luxury of time for trial and error when we’re talking about lives that are being lost as we speak,” she said. David Maurstad, FEMA’s deputy associate administrator for federal insurance and mitigation, said in a statement that the agency “is committed to delivering our programs with equity.” FEMA “will be persistent in our efforts to refine and improve the program through the lessons we learn and the feedback we receive from our stakeholders.” FEMA is planning a new round of $1 billion in funding for the nascent program, though the agency has not yet set a timeline for opening applications. In response to NBC News’ questions, FEMA said that it would work with up to 10 communities to help them prepare their applications for that funding. One obstacle that poorer communities face is that the new grant program does not cover the full cost of projects, requiring state or local governments to provide a 25 percent match. For economically disadvantaged areas with a population of 3,000 or less, the state or local share can drop to 10 percent. But that 10 percent can still be too high for some communities, shutting them out from applying. Malary White, a spokeswoman for the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, said in a statement that some cities and counties in the nation’s poorest state “simply can’t afford that cost share, therefore mitigation dollars go unused.” Amelia Muccio with Hagerty Consulting, an emergency management firm that advised California and other communities on FEMA’s grant requests, said smaller locales may also lack the resources to go through the cumbersome process of applying for the grant. Among many other requirements, communities had to show that the project ultimately cost less than the consequences of not taking action. “That kind of becomes a barrier,” Muccio said of the complex application process. “I’d argue that a lot of these communities don’t have a seat at the table.” Another setback for some communities was out-of-date construction and building codes. FEMA incentivizes state and local governments to adopt either the 2015 or 2018 versions of the International Building Code and International Residential Code, which set requirements for construction, such as requiring sprinkler systems in new homes, and are meant to provide a baseline of safety for buildings. In judging grant applications, FEMA awarded up to a fifth of the total available points to applicants in areas with the codes in place. The result was that all of the funds that FEMA expects to allocate through the competition — about two-thirds of the $500 million — are expected to go to applicants in states requiring adherence to these codes. This left out states that have not adopted them or have not required local jurisdictions to adhere; those states will receive just the $600,000 baseline grant, plus in some cases grants dedicated to Native American tribes. (In some states, updating building codes can become a contentious process opposed by real estate industry lobbyists who worry about additional costs for builders.) As hurricane and wildfire season sets in, many of the communities who lost out in FEMA’s initial round are regrouping and deciding whether to reapply in the future or seek another source of funds. In Wilson, North Carolina, where 51 percent of residents are Black or Latino, and the poverty rate is almost double the nation’s average, officials recently learned that their project was not picked. The local housing authority had hoped for $8.8 million to rebuild public housing in the city farther away from a flood-prone creek. The vacated homes would be torn down, so that the once-residential area could serve as a green space to help soak up water and reduce risks. Tim Rogers, a spokesman for the housing authority, said several tenants had already been forced to relocate after their apartments flooded during Hurricane Matthew in 2016. “Floods are getting worse,” Rogers said. “That’s one of the things we’re trying to prepare for.” In Coconino County, Arizona, which faces the combined threat of wildfires and flooding and where 16 percent of residents live in poverty, officials had asked for almost $188,000 for fire prevention efforts, including removing trees and brush. Lucinda Andreani, the county’s deputy manager, said residents who want to protect their homes generally have to spend thousands of dollars hiring specialists to cut down trees vulnerable to embers. Income is often a deciding factor between residents who can afford the mitigation efforts and residents who cannot. Andreani said the county is checking to see if Covid relief funds can be used for fire prevention, as the state’s congressional delegation continues to lobby for increased federal aid to fight wildfires. In Amazonia, Missouri, Mayor Rick Russell learned that the small town’s request to FEMA to help address flood threats was denied just weeks after a deluge of rain on June 24 led to emergency boat evacuations. “We were really hoping for this grant, especially after this flood,” he said. Russell is waiting to see if his town will receive federal disaster assistance for damage to infrastructure, including roads. The area was one of at least 21 counties in Missouri hit hard by storms and flooding last month. If the disaster funds come through, that could provide some relief — but Russell is still grappling with how to address the needs that led him to apply for FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities grant program in the first place. During last month’s flood, Amazonia received more than 12 inches of rain in a day, covering the town’s generator with almost 2 feet of water, making it inoperable. When the power goes out, the generator works as the town’s backstop, allowing its sewer system to continue pumping out water. After the storm, those pumps were down for two days until electricity was restored. Part of the funds Russell requested from FEMA would have been used to move the generator 4 feet higher, out of the likely path of floodwaters. As a last resort, the town’s council has given permission to tap into its roughly $150,000 reserve funds to elevate the generator. But that would reduce the reserve account’s balance by $45,000, a prospect the mayor prefers to avoid. The local water tower could need repairs in the coming years, he said. Many residents in the town are elderly and on a fixed income. Federal grants are critical to addressing the town’s infrastructure needs, as the mayor knows disasters can occur regardless of the town’s thin budget. “We try to keep our nose above water,” Russell said. “We have a low tax base.” Breaking news emails Be the first to know about breaking news and other NBC News reports.

" German officials on Tuesday were under growing pressure to explain why one of Europe's richest countries was apparently unprepared for catastrophic floods that have so far claimed the lives of close to 200 and left hundreds more missing. Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday will make her second visit to one flood-hit area, the historic spa town of Bad Münstereifel, about 20 miles southwest of Bonn. The normally popular tourist spot with traditional black-and-white buildings and cobbled streets lies obliterated after several months' worth of rain landed in the space of 24 hours Thursday into Friday. The death toll from the flooding in Germany stands at 197, with at least 300 missing and 749 injured, according to the police and affected regional governments. Many survivors have been left to pick up the pieces of shattered homes. ""Everything is destroyed on a scale I wasn’t able to imagine before I saw it today,"" said Roman Veith, a doctor who was helping his aunt salvage belongings from her ruined house in the riverside village of Dernau. ""It’s like hard mud, you almost can’t get it with a shovel,"" he said. ""Climate change has arrived in our backyard here in Germany,"" added Veith, 39. Germany military helicopters roared overhead, moving supplies from one end of the valley to the other. Like many towns in the flood zone, Dernau is without power. The number of dead is expected to rise as rescue and clear-up operations continue across the west of Germany, as well as parts of neighboring Belgium, where at least 31 people have died and dozens are missing. Belgium held a day of national mourning Tuesday in honor of the dead, some of whom were killed when a dozen houses alongside a river collapsed in the town of Pepinster in the east of the country. Thousands in The Netherlands were forced to evacuate last week after water breached flood defenses in the south. Merkel visited the town of Schuld on Sunday, where she warned that the floods were connected to climate change. ""The German language hardly knows any words for the devastation that has been caused here,"" she said during a speech there. The death toll has led to questions over why so many people seemed to have been surprised by flash flooding, with opposition politicians suggesting the death toll revealed serious failings in Germany's flood preparedness. Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, responding to the criticism during a visit to Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweile, defended the system, in which the German National Meteorological Service issues warnings to each of Germany's 16 states and from there to districts and communities, which then decide at a local level how to respond. ""It would be completely inconceivable for such a catastrophe to be managed centrally from any one place,"" Seehofer told journalists on Monday. ""You need local knowledge."" Seehofer, however, called for all layers of Germany's government — local, state and federal — to work together in future and admitted things could be improved. ""I'm not ruling out the fact that we have to improve one thing or the other,"" he said, according to the German DPA news agency. The DWD weather service warned on Monday, July 12, that heavy rain was heading to western Germany and that flooding was likely. On Wednesday morning, it said the risk of flooding was increasing and called on the population to seek guidance from local authorities. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told the Bild newspaper Monday, ""We will have to look at whether there were things that didn't go well, whether there were things that went wrong, and then they have to be corrected."" A regional government has pointed to another problem: Covid-19. ""At the moment, a lot of people are coming together in a very small space to overcome the crisis together. We now have to be careful that dealing with the disaster does not turn into a super-spread event,” David Freichel, a spokesperson from the Rhineland-Palatinate state leadership office told the RND newspaper network.

" Much of the western United States is one unlucky lightning strike or misplaced ember away from a major wildfire, thanks to a rare and dangerous combination of climate conditions. The huge wildfires currently burning across California and Oregon are the result of a mix of a historic drought, extreme heat and several other conditions that have the area primed to burn, scientists and fire experts say. And with more heat and dry weather expected in the coming months, this fire season could be worse than any in recent times. An NBC News analysis of 30 years of fire risk data shows that the heat dome that baked much of the region in late June was the final ingredient needed for explosive fire risk. This heat, on the heels of an extremely dry winter and spring, and in some places a few such such years, took the region from dry to even drier, allowing even the smallest spark to ignite a conflagration. This has led to a higher than average number of fires in the region so far this year. The Energy Release Component, an index compiled by a collection of government agencies called the National Wildlife Coordinating Group that takes into account plant moisture conditions and is used by fire scientists to gauge fire risk, spiked significantly above average in several states prone to forest fires, including California, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington, following the record-breaking temperatures in late June. Experts say this shows that the conditions were ripe for the early, strong start to the wildfire season. “I like to think about the ingredients of fire being somewhat similar to the ingredients you need to start a campfire,” said John Abatzoglou, an associate professor at the University of California Merced’s Climatology Lab. “You need enough fuel, some fine fuels [kindling, flammable plant matter], you need that fuel to be dry enough, and you need an ignition source to bring all those three things together and you have what it takes for a fire.” In 2021 all of the ingredients have come together, leaving the region ready for a fire. “The West is a tinderbox this year,” Abatzoglou said. The high heat and dry weather have led to conditions on the ground throughout the Northwest that are normally seen much later in a typical fire season. “We're seeing fire behavior that we typically don't see until the middle of August,” said Josh Harvey, the fire management bureau chief at the Idaho Department of Lands. Trees wet enough to resist the heat of an ignition usually help slow the spread of fires, experts say. Firefighters in Oregon say the conditions on the ground are so dry that even large trees are contributing to the spread. “It’s almost as if the trees are going up like grass,” said Jim Gersbach, a spokesperson at the Oregon Department of Forestry. “They’re going up that quickly and instantly torching, because the needles don’t have much moisture.” What starts a fire can be random, Abatzoglou said, pointing to lightning storms or accidental sparks from gender-reveal parties. But the conditions must be right for the fire to see explosive growth. “What we’re seeing, at least during years like this, is it’s dry for a long period of the year and over a large geographic area,” Abatzoglou said. “It’s those extra spins on that roulette wheel that increase the potential for fires to find their way to burn on the landscape.” Forests are also much denser due to the practice of putting out all wildfires for much of the last century, regardless of their threat to people. A dense forest requires more water to stay healthy, leaving it more likely to dry out and kindle an explosive fire. “Because of the way we’ve managed the forests, we’ve set up the conditions for fires to be more severe,” said Donald Falk, a professor at the University of Arizona School of Natural Resources and the Environment. “That’s on us. We’ve prevented fire from doing its job.” Even before the Beckwourth Complex Fire in California and the Bootleg Fire in Oregon exploded in size, firefighters this year have dealt with an abnormally high number of smaller fires. In Oregon, Gersbach said that firefighters have battled 68 percent more fires so far this year than average. And it’s not just Oregon: much of the western and northwestern U.S. has also been home to a significantly higher number of fire starts. With many states in the Northwest seeing similarly unprecedented and severe conditions, resources are running thin. “When we talk about resources available to fight these fires, the system is tapped,” said Harvey, from the Idaho Department of Lands. “There’s just not much out there.” Overstretched staffs make it more likely for small fires that would have been otherwise contained to grow out of control, Harvey said. Strong, consistent rains are what ends fire seasons, experts say. With the highest temperatures of a typical calendar year most likely yet to arrive, wildfires will get worse unless rainfall arrives. “We just don’t have a great reason to believe that’s going to happen,” Abatzoglou said. If strong winds arrive before the rains, an already bad fire season could become disastrous. Abatzoglou said that when wind hits a fire, especially in a drought, “you can get upwards of a half million acres in a couple days.” Experts say changes in the region’s climate mean that conditions will be increasingly ripe for fires. “What we do appreciate is that Oregon and much of the western United States is experiencing the cumulative effects of multiple years of drought, and that’s having an impact on fire frequency and intensity,” Gersbach said. “This is something of a new normal.” Get the Evening Rundown A rundown of the day's top stories and headlines.

" A flip in a natural moon cycle combined with rising seas from climate change will cause rapid and ""dramatic"" increases in flooding along U.S. coastlines by the mid-2030s, according to a NASA study. The research, published last month in the journal Nature Climate Change, found that changes in the coming decades to the angle of the moon's orbit and its alignment with the Earth and sun will amplify the effects of sea-level rise, leading to a sharp rise in high-tide flooding in coastal communities. The findings add new urgency to address rising sea levels in many Atlantic and Gulf Coast cities, where high-tide flooding is already an issue. But the study also highlights how flooding could become widespread for almost all coastal communities in the country by the middle of the next decade. ""This is the point in time when things will begin to rapidly change,"" said Philip Thompson, an assistant professor in the department of oceanography at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and lead author of the study. ""When we think about when we need to improve and have things ready with our drainage systems and infrastructure, this gives a target point."" The surge in high-tide flooding will be driven in part by the moon's natural ""wobbling"" as it orbits the Earth. The moon's tilt changes over an 18.6-year cycle, and that motion affects the ebb and flow of Earth's tides. For half of the cycle, the planet's regular, daily tides are suppressed, essentially counteracting the effect of rising seas. For the remainder of the cycle, the moon's wobble boosts the effects of sea-level rise. ""It doesn't change the strength of tidal forces or the gravitational forces of the moon, but it tends to increase the range between the highest and lowest tides of the day,"" Thompson said. ""In other words, it tends to make the highest tides even higher and the lowest tides even lower."" By the mid-2030s, the lunar cycle will be set to amplify Earth's tides once again. When combined with rising sea levels due to climate change, the cumulative result is a significant increase in high-tide flooding, the researchers found. Climate change contributes to sea-level rise because ocean water expands as it warms and higher temperatures cause land-based ice, such as glaciers and ice sheets, to melt. It's against this backdrop of rising seas that changes to Earth's tides could have the most damaging effect. ""If you have water in a bathtub and the height of that water is changing over time, that is sea-level rise,"" said study co-author Gary Mitchum, associate dean at the University of South Florida College of Marine Science. ""If on top of that you put your hand in and slosh it back and forth so that waves spill over the side of the tub, those are the tides. The tides and sea-level rise are different, but they add up."" The researchers found that from the mid-2030s into the following decade, the changing lunar cycle will cause clusters of flooding in coastal communities. In St. Petersburg, Florida, for example, high-tide flooding is projected to increase from six or seven events a year to 10 times that amount in just over a decade. This increase in flooding could have significant economic implications, in addition to disrupting day-to-day life, particularly because the high-tide flooding events could be clustered together based on seasonal cycles. ""In some cases, there might be flood events up to 20 times a month, or almost daily,"" said Benjamin Hamlington, a research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and a co-author of the study. ""If you're dealing with that for a whole month, that starts to impact life in a different kind of way."" High-tide flooding is sometimes known as ""nuisance flooding"" or ""sunny-day flooding,"" but Mitchum said those terms can be deceiving because they often downplay the severity. ""They sound like no big deal, and while each event may be minor in and of itself, it's death by a thousand cuts,"" he said. Thomas Wahl, an assistant professor in the department of civil, environmental and construction engineering at the University of Central Florida, who was not involved with the research, said the report should be a wake-up call for coastal communities. ""What this shows us is that we're at a point where we need to make some decisions if we're going to be prepared in the 2030s,"" he said. The findings also provide a realistic timeline for city planners to boost resilience into regions that will be increasingly affected by high-tide flooding. ""This helps illuminate the time scales that we're operating under,"" Wahl said. ""Knowing how long it can take from having an idea of what to do to having something implemented, 10 years is not a very long time.""

" The Trans-Alaska Pipeline, one of the world’s largest oil pipelines, could be in danger. Thawing permafrost threatens to undermine the supports holding up an elevated section of the pipeline, jeopardizing its structural integrity and raising the potential of an oil spill in a delicate and remote landscape. The slope of permafrost where an 810-foot section of the pipeline is secured has started to shift as it thaws, causing several of the braces holding up the pipeline to twist and bend. This appears to be the first instance that pipeline supports have been damaged by “slope creep” caused by thawing permafrost, records and interviews with officials involved with managing the pipeline show. In response, the Alaska Department of Natural Resources has approved the use of about 100 thermosyphons — tubes that suck heat out of permafrost — to keep the frozen slope in place and prevent further damage to the pipeline’s support structure. “The proposed project is integral to the protection of the pipeline,” according to the department’s November 2020 analysis. “The implications of this speak to the pipeline’s integrity and the effect climate change is having on pipeline safety in general.” While the use of these tubes is common along the pipeline’s expanse, available records show that they have never been previously used as a defensive safeguard once a slope has begun to slide. “This is a wake-up call,” said Carl Weimer, a special projects adviser for Pipeline Safety Trust, a nonprofit watchdog organization based in Bellingham, Washington. “The implications of this speak to the pipeline’s integrity and the effect climate change is having on pipeline safety in general.” Permafrost is ground that has remained completely frozen for at least two years straight and is found beneath nearly 85 percent of Alaska. In the last few decades, permafrost temperatures there have warmed as much as 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit. The state’s average temperature is projected to increase 2 to 4 degrees more by the middle of the century, and a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change projects that with every 2 degree increase in temperature, 1.5 million square miles of permafrost could be lost to thawing. In seeking permission in February 2020 to install the thermosyphons on the slope northwest of Fairbanks near the Dalton Highway in the central part of the state, the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., which operates the pipeline, confirmed that thawing permafrost posed a threat. “The purpose of this project is to protect the integrity of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline (mainline) from permafrost degradation,” according to the company’s application. Michelle Egan, a spokeswoman for Alyeska, an association of oil companies that includes a subsidiary of Hilcorp Energy Co., as well as ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil, declined to talk about the condition of the weakened section of pipe or the extent of permafrost thawing. Egan said that “permafrost changes were anticipated during the original design” of the 800-mile pipeline, which opened in 1977 and runs from Prudhoe Bay in the north to Valdez on Prince William Sound in the south. There are about 124,000 thermosyphons arrayed along the path of the pipeline — a nod from its engineers to the importance of keeping the ground below it frozen. The tubes are bored from 15 to 70 feet into the permafrost in areas where warming might cause it to thaw. But those chillers only cool the permafrost directly below the pipeline, which holds the supports. The new project, in which Alyeska is installing about 100 free-standing thermosyphons 40 to 60 feet into the ground, is required to keep a broader slope from collapsing or sliding and damaging the supports. Construction began last month and is expected to take 120 days and will also include a three-foot layer of insulating wood chips atop the permafrost. To avoid problems with the permafrost, 420 miles of the pipeline were built on an elevated support system that keeps the pipe about 6 feet above the ground. The frames that hold the pipeline, called vertical support members, look like a capital H with the pipeline resting on the cross stroke. Tony Strupulis, the pipeline coordinator for the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, said there is no reason for panic — the support structures are not in immediate danger of collapse. But he added that the department remains “very mindful” about the implications of thawing permafrost for pipeline safety. “The design philosophy is, ‘If it’s frozen, keep it frozen,’” he said. As the melting permafrost threatens pipeline supports and raises the potential of an oil spill, Alyeska says in its emergency response plans that cleaning up a spill could accelerate the thawing. Alyeska’s plan to chill the permafrost with additional thermosyphons in the face of global warming, as Alaska heats up twice as fast as the global average, underscores an obvious irony: The oil industry must act to keep the permafrost frozen to maintain an infrastructure that allows it to extract more of the fossil fuels that cause the warming. There have been 18 breaches of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline in the last 20 years, according to data from the Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration (PHMSA). Spills have ranged from less than one barrel to 6,800 barrels. In all, the pipeline has spilled 9,784 barrels of oil, resulting in $52.7 million in damages and costs, according to the PHMSA records. Causes of the spills include breaks in corroded pipe to equipment failure and operator error. None of the spills recorded by PHMSA were attributed to permafrost thaw. The extent of ecological damage from another spill would depend on the amount of oil spilled, how deep it saturated the soil and whether the plume reached water sources. But any harm from an oil spill would likely be greater than in most other landscapes because of the fragile nature of the Alaskan land and water. “A massive oil spill would be impossible to clean up in the Alaskan environment,” said Kristen Monsell, a senior attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit organization focused on protecting wild animals and plants. Federal and Alaska state regulators do not have specific guidelines for addressing safety issues related to thawing permafrost. Instead, they rely on general rules that require pipeline operators to evaluate stress factors, such as earthquakes, vibration and thermal expansion and contraction. “While there is no way to make transporting oil safe, the regulatory agencies need to be doing everything they can to protect from the potential harms,” Monsell said. The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation said its focus is on ensuring that operators maintain pipeline integrity by adhering to state-mandated inspections that follow industry safety standards. “Pipeline subsidence, regardless of cause, should be addressed through a maintenance and inspection program,” spokeswoman Laura Achee said in an email. “DEC does not have guidelines that are specific to permafrost.” Richard Kuprewicz, president of Accufacts Inc., a pipeline consulting firm, said it wouldn’t be wise for pipeline operators to count on permafrost remaining solid in the same way as in the past. Assessing pipelines to determine if years-old structural designs can withstand the changing conditions and accelerated rate of permafrost thaw is prudent, he said. “Operators need to understand this new world being brought about by climate change,” he said. “What was true in the past may not be true today.” Doug Goering, dean emeritus of the University of Alaska at Fairbanks College of Engineering and Mines, credits the Trans-Alaska Pipeline for its robust safety design. Yet, he said thawing permafrost can pose considerable risk to the structural integrity of pipelines. “If the permafrost thaws, the ground loses its grip on the piling,” he said. “You can understand the consequences.” Breaking news emails Be the first to know about breaking news and other NBC News reports."
" In 127 years of record-keeping, the United States was never this hot in June.  Blistering and record-setting heat waves on both the West Coast and the East Coast made last month the hottest June in U.S. history, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. As the Earth continues to warm, heat waves like what the U.S. experienced in June are becoming more frequent and more intense. With climate change leading to warming temperatures overall, this makes the baseline temperatures for heat waves higher than they otherwise would have been decades ago. NOAA also noted that the country has already experienced eight natural disasters that topped more than $1 billion each in damage this year, with total losses in the first six months at a near record high. The previous hottest June on record was 2016, which was nearly a whole degree cooler when it came to the average temperature across the contiguous U.S. When breaking down the June heat by state, the statistics get even more alarming. Eight states saw their hottest June on record, including Arizona, California, Idaho, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Utah. California had a statewide average of 6.8 degrees above average. Six other states registered their second-hottest June. The June temperature records were staggering at the city level. During the Pacific Northwest heat wave of June 25-30, temperatures soared up to 40 degrees above average and approximately 175 record highs were set across parts of northern California, Oregon, Washington and Idaho.  Portland, Oregon, was one of those cities climbing to 116 degrees breaking its record by 9 degrees. Seattle experienced an unprecedented three straight days of triple-digit temperatures. The U.S. Olympic team trials for track and field had to move events to earlier in the morning or after sunset to protect the athletes from the blistering heat. The trials were even halted one afternoon when track temperatures neared 150 degrees. At the same time that the Pacific Northwest was boiling under one of the worst heat waves in American history, the Northeast endured its second heat wave of the season. Temperatures in the mid-to-upper 90s broke records in cities such as Newark, New Jersey, and New York City. Even Boston hit a rare 100 degrees, which was its first such reading in a decade.  The exceptional heat has also helped to fuel the expansive drought across the entire Western region. Nearly 95 percent of the West is currently facing drought, up from 40 percent this same time last year. Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories.

" LOS ANGELES — California Gov. Gavin Newsom called on residents Thursday to voluntarily cut back on their water consumption by 15 percent as the state dives further into drought and temperatures continue to soar past seasonal averages. Newsom, a Democrat who faces a recall election in September, expanded a regional drought state of emergency to 50 of California's 58 counties, home to about 42 percent of the population. Large counties like Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco are not included in the emergency proclamation. ""We're hopeful that people will take that mindset they brought into the last drought and extend that forward with a 15 percent voluntary reduction, not only on residences but industrial commercial operations and agricultural operations,"" Newsom told reporters in San Luis Obispo County. The state of emergency authorizes the California Water Resources Control Board, which oversees the state water supply, to reduce the right to divert water from rivers if there is a shortage. It also allows state agencies to more easily transfer water for priority use. A statewide drought declared in 2014 by Gov. Jerry Brown remained in place for three years. That drought depleted groundwater supplies and changed how residents and businesses use water, including rethinking landscaping to include more drought-tolerant plants. It also drew the attention of Donald Trump, who ridiculed the state's emergency response and declared as he was running for president in 2016 that no drought was threatening California. The state is not yet at the crisis levels experienced during the last drought, but residents should prepare now for what could become a greater environmental challenge in years to come, warned Alex Hall, director of the Center for Climate Science at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""We live in a place where water resources are really volatile,"" he said. ""Different parts of the state are vulnerable. There are farmers in the Central Valley that are losing their livelihoods because there isn’t enough water."" Across the California, urban water use is down by 16 percent since before the previous drought, Newsom said Thursday. But with temperatures rising and no precipitation expected for several more months, the entire state could soon be under a state of emergency. While 50 counties are now included in the proclamation, ""I imagine it is a question now of time whether those others will more quickly enter into the fold,"" Newsom said. The governor has steadily added more counties to the state of emergency in recent months. In May, he expanded the proclamation to include 41 counties, up from two in April. Still, he is taking a cautious approach, relying on hydrology reports from state and local water agencies before issuing more drastic measures. Asked whether climate change is to blame, Newsom did not hesitate. ""Those are the effects of climate change. It's here, and it's human-induced,"" he said. ""I think in the state of California we've moved beyond the debate and are moving toward finding a solution."" According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, a federal agency, 100 percent of California was abnormally dry Thursday and nearly 95 percent of the state was in severe drought. More than 30 percent of the state, including several Northern California counties, are under exceptional drought conditions, a harbinger of increased fire risk and low survival rates for native plants and wildlife. At least two dozen wildfires were burning throughout the state Thursday. California had already experienced 3,856 fires from Jan. 1 to July 4, compared to 3,297 during the same period last year, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Despite the worsening drought, Newsom stressed that water restrictions are voluntary, highlighting ""common sense"" strategies like watering lawns less frequently, taking shorter showers and waiting to run large appliances, like washing machines and dishwashers, until loads are full. ""The good news is we’ve done this before and we’re really good at it,"" said Peter Roquemore, assistant project manager at the UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation. ""During the last drought, when Californians were called on to conserve, we did it and even exceeded the conservation goals.""

" The deadly heat wave that roasted the Pacific Northwest and western Canada was virtually impossible without human-caused climate change that added a few extra degrees to the record-smashing temperatures, a new quick scientific analysis found. An international team of 27 scientists calculated that climate change increased chances of the extreme heat occurring by at least 150 times, but likely much more. The study, not yet peer reviewed, said that before the industrial era, the region’s late June triple-digit heat was the type that would not have happened in human civilization. And even in today’s warming world, it said, the heat was a once-in-a-millennium event. But that once-in-a-millennium event would likely occur every five to 10 years once the world warms another 1.4 degrees (0.8 degrees Celsius), said Wednesday’s study from World Weather Attribution. That much warming could be 40 or 50 years away if carbon pollution continues at its current pace, one study author said. This type of extreme heat “would go from essentially virtually impossible to relatively commonplace,” said study co-author Gabriel Vecchi, a Princeton University climate scientist. “That is a huge change.” The study also found that in the Pacific Northwest and Canada climate change was responsible for about 3.6 degrees (2 degrees Celsius) of the heat shock. Those few degrees make a big difference in human health, said study co-author Kristie Ebi, a professor at the Center for Health and the Global Environment at the University of Washington. “This study is telling us climate change is killing people,” said Ebi, who endured the blistering heat in Seattle. She said it will be many months before a death toll can be calculated from June’s blast of heat but it’s likely to be hundreds or thousands. “Heat is the No. 1 weather-related killer of Americans.” In Oregon alone, the state medical examiner on Wednesday reported 116 deaths related to the heat wave. The team of scientists used a well-established and credible method to search for climate change’s role in extreme weather, according to the National Academy of Sciences. They logged observations of what happened and fed them into 21 computer models and ran numerous simulations. They then simulated a world without greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. The difference between the two scenarios is the climate change portion. “Without climate change this event would not have happened,” said study senior author Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford. What made the Northwest heat wave so remarkable is how much hotter it was than old records and what climate models had predicted. Scientists say this hints that some kind of larger climate shift could be in play — and in places that they didn’t expect. “Everybody is really worried about the implications of this event,” said study co-author Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, a Dutch climate scientist. “This is something that nobody saw coming, that nobody thought possible. And we feel that we do not understand heat waves as well as we thought we did. The big question for many people is: Could this also happen in a lot of places?” The World Weather Attribution team does these quick analyses, which later get published in peer-reviewed journals. In the past, they have found similar large climate change effects in many heat waves, including ones in Europe and Siberia. But sometimes the team finds climate change wasn’t a factor, as they did in a Brazilian drought and a heat wave in India. Six outside scientists said the quick study made sense and probably underestimated the extent of climate change’s role in the heat wave. That’s because climate models used in the simulations usually underestimate how climate change alters the jet stream that parks “heat domes” over regions and causes some heat waves, said Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann. The models also underestimate how dry soil worsens heat because there is less water to evaporate, which feeds a vicious cycle of drought, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA and the Nature Conservancy. The study hit home for University of Victoria climate scientist Andrew Weaver, who wasn’t part of the research team. “Victoria, which is known for its mild climate, felt more like Death Valley last week,” Weaver said. “I’ve been in a lot of hot places in the world, and this was the worst I’ve ever been in. “But you ain’t seen nothing yet,” he added. “It’s going to get a lot worse.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories."
" Severe wildfires that engulfed parts of western Canada this week were so intense that they generated massive ""fire clouds"" that spawned their own lightning storms. In what some experts said was one of the most extreme events they've ever witnessed, more than 700,000 intracloud and cloud-to-ground flashes of lightning — from both fire clouds and regular thunderstorms — were recorded Wednesday over a 15-hour period. ""That's 5 percent of Canada's lightning in just 15 hours,"" said Chris Vagasky, a Colorado-based meteorologist with Vaisala, a Finnish company that specializes in weather and other environmental measurements. Wildfires so extreme they create their own weather are not common occurrences, but with climate change making fires both more frequent and more intense, scientists say the risks of such events sparking out-of-control blazes will likely increase in the future. A fire cloud, known as a pyrocumulonimbus cloud or pyroCb, typically forms when a fire rages with enough intensity that it creates updrafts of smoke, water vapor and ash that rise high into the atmosphere. These columns of air then cool and condense, forming clouds that can generate thunder, lightning and tornado-force winds. Pyrocumulonimbus clouds are worrisome because they can cause wildfires to behave erratically, making it difficult for firefighters to control the blazes or predict how they will evolve. Fire clouds can also help wildfires spread by kicking up burning embers that land downwind or by producing lightning strikes that ignite new areas. It's not well understood why some large fires create pyrocumulonimbus clouds and others don't, and it remains an active area of research. Scientists are also hoping to better understand the effect of climate change on the emergence of fire clouds. In general, though, scientists have observed an increase in the frequency and intensity of wildfires as a result of global warming. ""As the Earth continues to warm, you tend to get drier periods that create more favorable conditions for wildfires,"" said Dakota Smith, a meteorologist based in Colorado. ""If you're increasing the frequency of wildfires, you're also increasing the chance of extreme wildfire behavior."" The wildfires raging in British Columbia and Alberta developed on the heels of a historic heat wave that brought record-setting temperatures to the entire Pacific Northwest. It was that punishing heat that helped create ideal conditions for large fires to break out, said Mike Flannigan, director of the Canadian Partnership for Wildland Fire Science at the University of Alberta. ""It was a powder keg just waiting for a spark,"" he said. Wildfires, regardless of where they occur, need three basic ingredients to thrive: vegetation — such as dried-out leaves, twigs, cones and dead trees — that act as fuel; conducive conditions like hot, dry and windy weather; and finally, some type of ignition such as lightning or a human-caused event. The recent heat wave, which produced temperatures well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit for several days in parts of British Columbia, helped dry out the land and create a perfect storm of wildfire ingredients. ""The drier it is, the easier it is for a fire to start and spread,"" Flannigan said. ""It also means there is more fuel available to burn and more energy being released, so you have a higher-intensity fire."" As such, when an ignition event occurs, the consequences can be devastating. Nowhere was that more evident than in the village of Lytton, British Columbia, which set new national temperature records three days in a row, peaking at a scorching 121 degrees on Tuesday. A day later, a fast-moving wildfire tore through the area, forcing a mandatory evacuation order shortly before the entire town was consumed in flames. Flannigan said it's unusual to see such severe wildfires in British Columbia this early in the summer. If conditions stay hot and dry, the region could be in for a punishing fire season. ""The risk is high and the potential for an extremely active season is there,"" he said. ""In part, that's already being realized now.""

" Part of the Arctic is nicknamed the “Last Ice Area,” because floating sea ice there is usually so thick that it’s likely to withstand global warming for decades. So, scientists were shocked last summer when there was suddenly enough open water for a ship to pass through. The opening, documented by scientists aboard a German icebreaker, popped up in late July and August in the Wandel Sea north of Greenland. Mostly it was due to a freak weather event, but thinning sea ice from decades of climate change was a significant factor, according to a study Thursday in the journal Communications Earth and Environment. While scientists have said most of the Arctic could be free of summer sea ice by mid-century, the Last Ice Area was not part of that equation. They figure the 380,000-square-mile (1-million-square-kilometer) area won’t be ice-free in the summer until around 2100, said study co-author Kent Moore, a University of Toronto atmospheric physicist. “It’s called the Last Ice Area for a reason. We thought it was kind of stable,” said co-author Mike Steele, a University of Washington oceanographer. “It’s just pretty shocking. ... In 2020, this area melted out like crazy.” Scientists believe the area — north of Greenland and Canada — could become the last refuge for animals like polar bears that depend on ice, said Kristin Laidre, a co-author and biologist at the University of Washington. The main cause for the sudden ice loss was extraordinary strong winds that pushed the ice out the region and down the coast of Greenland, Moore said. That had happened in smaller, infrequent episodes, but this time was different, Moore said. The researchers used computer simulations and 40 years of Arctic sea data to calculate that “there was a significant climate change signal” — about 20%, they estimate — in the event, Moore said. In the past, thicker Wandel Sea ice would have resisted the strong winds, but in 2020 it was thinner and “more easily broken up and pushed out,” said National Snow and Ice Data Center scientist Walt Meier, who wasn’t part of the study. Another part of the Last Ice Area, off Canada’s Ellesmere Island, had open waters after the July 2020 collapse of part of the Milne ice shelf, but scientists are still studying it to determine if there is a climate change connection, Moore said.

" A long-term drought that has hit two-thirds of Mexico looks set to worsen in coming weeks, with forecasts warning of high temperatures, crop damage and water supply shortages on the horizon, including in the populous capital. Experts are sounding the alarm that parched crops could under-produce as temperatures hit 40 degrees Celsius (104F) on Wednesday in some parts of northern Mexico, including key farming areas. ""In some states, irrigation is practically disappearing due to lack of precipitation,"" said Rafael Sanchez Bravo, a water expert at Chapingo Autonomous University, noting low reservoirs and reduced water transfers to farms. Mexico's drought parallels that of the western United States and Canada, where crop yields are threatened and water rationing has been imposed. While rains were only 3 percent below average across Mexico as a whole last year, the strain on water reserves was exacerbated by increased domestic demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, a U.S. government report showed last month. Hopes to replenish Mexico's parched reservoirs now hinge on the traditional rainy season, known formally as the North American Monsoon, which is now underway. ""The next three months will be really crucial in how this drought turns out,"" said Andreas Prein, an atmospheric scientist for the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. Much of Mexico gets between 50 percent and 80 percent of its annual rainfall between July and September. Water shortages are common in parts of Mexico, but have worsened amid heat extremes blamed on climate change, according to scientists and data from federal water commission CONAGUA. About 70 percent of Mexico is impacted by drought, up from about half in December. About a fifth of the country is experiencing extreme drought compared to less than 5 percent each year since 2012. Experts fear the problem will reach more of the 22 million inhabitants of Mexico City's metro area, which is quenched by a network of reservoirs. Some districts have no piped drinking water at the best of times. ""I have no doubt that in 2022 there will be a crisis,"" said Sanchez, who anticipates possible social unrest. ""The reservoirs are completely depleted."" Sanchez is encouraging local authorities to invest in collecting rainfall for domestic use. Villa Victoria, an important source for Mexico City, was among 77 of 210 principal reservoirs below 25% capacity at the end of June, according to CONAGUA data. Cracked lake beds can be seen at others around the city. Images by a European Commission satellite show a visible depletion at Villa Victoria on June 15 of this year, compared to June 30 last year when it was already half empty. This time last year, there were 56 reservoirs below 25% capacity. Two years ago, there were just 40. The drought has prompted the government to seed clouds with silver iodide over the next three months in a trio of northern farming states — Sinaloa, Sonora and Chihuahua — in a bid to induce rain with the help of specially-equipped air force planes, according to an agriculture ministry statement. But this year's corn production target of 28 million tonnes is still at risk. ""The scenario is pessimistic and we can't deny we're worried,"" said a senior agriculture ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity. It can be difficult for scientists to attribute any single event to climate change, but more extreme droughts point to warming global temperatures that researchers say is due to greenhouse gas emissions, said Prein. The heat saps moisture from soil. ""That's a big deal. If you are already in a very dry region like the western part of Mexico and you increase the temperature, you lose a lot of water just by evaporation,"" said Prein.

" WASHINGTON — The scorching temperatures and the drought pummeling the western United States are creating a perfect storm for the electric grid, exposing how future extreme weather events will increasingly push a thinly stretched power system to the brink. As Oregon, California, New Mexico and other states grapple with record-setting heat and diminishing water supplies, Americans are relying even more on electricity and water supply systems. Yet the same factors that are driving up demand for power can also limit the ability to generate it. From generation at power plants to the transmission lines that carry electricity to homes and businesses, just about every part of the power system performs worse in conditions that are intensely hot and dry. That raises significant questions about the nation’s readiness for a future in which, climate scientists say, global warming is expected to make extreme weather events even more common. “This topic is on top of every utility’s agenda right now,” said Omar Al-Juburi, a digital power grid consultant at Ernst & Young. “We’re going to get to a point where the current infrastructure and the current way of operating is going to continue to be strained by these extreme heat waves.” In Portland, Oregon, temperatures this month have hit 116 degrees Fahrenheit — an all-time high — just one year after the state saw unprecedented wildfires as early in the year as Labor Day. “That is scary, because that means you don't know what's happened,” Bob Jenks, executive director of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, said. “That means the past is no longer predictive of the future.” A Portland-area power company even had to install extra cooling systems to prevent its own equipment from overheating. Those cooling systems themselves use electricity, as do the air conditioners that Oregonians are now buying up in droves. Jenks said that means that the next time the region faces a heat wave, there will be more air conditioners being used demanding even more power and further straining the system. The severe drought plaguing huge swaths of the West, with lake levels dropping and riverbeds drying up, poses another challenge to keeping the power on for Americans. Fuel-burning power plants such as coal, natural gas and even nuclear plants often rely on water to cool off their systems.  The less water nearby or available to be pumped from elsewhere, the less power those plants can safely generate, according to energy analysts.  A water shortage can even take a power plant offline — a scenario that has only occurred rarely and for short periods, such as at Connecticut’s Millstone Nuclear Power Station. But federal regulators are studying how to respond if that problem gets worse or more widespread. “Researchers have shown that drought threatens coal and nuclear power plant water supplies in the Upper Midwest, and the southeastern U.S., in New England as well as the western U.S.,” Joe Smyth of the Energy and Policy Institute, a watchdog group, said. When drought sets in, the most acute impact on electricity generation is felt by hydroelectric plants, dams that generate power from nature’s own resources, many of them federally owned and operated. Those plants provide key resilience for the electric grid through their ability to rapidly ramp up or down production to meet demand, sometimes in as little as a few seconds. In the current drought, a lower level of water in the Colorado River is already affecting power generation and delivery, said Tracey LeBeau, who runs the U.S. Department of Energy’s Western Area Power Administration. ""Less water often results in less water running through turbines and creating electricity,” LeBeau u said. “Right now, in many regions, power is in higher demand because of the higher temperatures. So it's really a double whammy for us.” Those effects are especially pronounced at Lake Mead, on the Colorado River. The nation’s largest reservoir by volume, the lake provides the water source for the iconic Hoover Dam, which provides power for Arizona, Nevada and California. This week, water levels in Lake Mead fell to a record low of less than 1,070 feet — 18 feet lower than it was last year. The federal Bureau of Reclamation has said the lower water levels have already reduced the dam’s electric output by a quarter, and is expected to worsen. The blistering heat and wildfires that often accompany drought also have ramifications for other parts of the power system.  A 2012 study from the Energy Department’s Argonne National Laboratory examining drought’s long-term impacts on power systems in the Southwest stated that during heat wave conditions, transmission lines carry power less efficiently. Gas-fired power plants don’t operate as well, and even solar panels produce less electricity under those conditions, the study said. “Extreme weather is also impacting us with respect to wildfire danger — right now,” LeBeau said. “Throughout the last week, we've had wildfires coming perilously close to our transmission lines carrying that federal hydropower to customers.”  California offers a harrowing example. In recent years, the state’s largest utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, forced outages pre-emptively because the extreme heat and power lines risked a dangerous combination, particularly during wildfire season. “As climate change induces extreme weather events more and more frequently, we need to make investments to build a more resilient grid to carry this electricity,” President Joe Biden said Monday during a visit to La Crosse, Wisconsin. The challenge of meeting energy demand during extreme weather is likely to be compounded as the nation seeks to rely more and more on electricity in its bid to address climate change, a transition known as “electrification.” Rather than burning carbon dioxide-emitting gas or oil to power vehicles, stoves, and heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems, the Biden administration is seeking to transition those devices to run on electricity. If the electricity used comes from renewable sources such as hydro, solar or wind, the process can be essentially carbon-neutral, aiding in the fight to limit climate change. Yet, all that electricity must come from somewhere. When renewable energy sources aren’t enough, energy experts said, the backup tends to be the dirtier options: Old coal and gas power plants, or even oil-burning generators in emergency situations. Burning those fossil fuels produces even more greenhouse gas emissions, worsening climate change by trapping heat in the atmosphere, and setting off a vicious cycle that may test the U.S. power grid more and more often at the times when Americans rely on it the most.

" Larry O'Neill knew a heat wave was coming, but he still couldn't believe what the climate models were telling him. The projected temperatures for this week were so unusually high — between 115 and 120 degrees Fahrenheit across parts of the Pacific Northwest — that O'Neill, Oregon's state climatologist, felt something must be off. ""The predictions seemed completely outlandish,"" said O'Neill, an associate professor at Oregon State University. ""They were so crazy insane that professional forecasters and people like myself thought something must be wrong with the models."" As it turned out, the forecasts were right. With global warming making heat waves and other extreme weather events both more likely and more severe, this week's sizzling temperatures may herald a climate reality that scientists thought was still decades in the future. ""We see evidence of climate change in the data already, but in the Pacific Northwest, we thought maybe by the middle of the century is when we would start to see really substantial and impactful events,"" O'Neill said. ""But we're seeing those now."" Across the western United States, more than 35 cities tied or set temperature records Monday, with several places shattering their all-time highs. Seattle posted a new record of 108 degrees, 5 degrees hotter than the city's previous all-time record, and Portland, Oregon, reached a scorching 116 degrees, surpassing the city's previous milestone by 8 degrees. The intensity of the heat, particularly in a region of the country known for its mild conditions, has been shocking, said Nicholas Bond, a research scientist at the University of Washington and Washington's state climatologist. ""The magnitude by which records are being broken — not by a degree or so but by 5 degrees and in some cases more — is really stunning,"" Bond said. ""I didn't really expect anything like this until further into the future."" What's driving the oppressive heat is a ridge of high pressure parked over the Pacific Northwest that Bond said was ""exquisitely poised to deliver hot temperatures."" These giant domes of heat have been associated with tropical cyclone activity in the western Pacific Ocean, which can alter the circulation of air over the Northern Hemisphere and generate unusual weather patterns. ""The tropical cyclones tend to disrupt the jet stream all across the Pacific Ocean,"" O'Neill said, adding that they can affect both high- and low-pressure systems. ""If we get a tropical cyclone, we're three times more likely to get a high-pressure ridge set up close to where we see this one."" It's not yet clear how climate change is affecting the jet stream and resulting weather systems, but the consequences of these complex atmospheric perturbations taking place against the backdrop of global warming is well understood. Average temperatures in the Pacific Northwest have warmed by roughly 1.3 degrees since 1895, according to the University of Washington's Climate Impacts Group, and most cities in the region feel more than 2 degrees warmer in the summer than they did in 1970.  ""Along with that warming, we've seen an increase in extreme heat events, and these events are becoming more frequent, more intense and longer in duration,"" said Meade Krosby, a senior scientist with the Climate Impacts Group. It's a trend that is playing out across the country. A national climate assessment conducted in 2018 found that heat waves in the U.S. occurred an average of six times per year in the 2010s, up from an average of two times a year five decades earlier. The effects of extreme heat are similarly being felt around the world. Parts of eastern Europe and Russia are currently baking under record highs, with some Bulgarian cities predicted to reach 104 degrees and temperatures in Siberia soaring to nearly 90 degrees. Though attributing any specific event to climate change is tricky, scientists say the overall effect of global warming is undeniable, creating conditions that are ripe for heat waves and other extreme weather events. ""The question is no longer if climate change caused a specific heat event, but by how much,"" Krosby said. Temperatures in parts of Oregon and Washington have likely peaked, but hotter-than-usual conditions are expected to linger through the weekend. Experts said it's disconcerting to see such a crippling heat wave this early in the summer, adding that the implications could be dire for this year's wildfire season. For O'Neill, he hopes the recent events act as a wake-up call about the immediate impacts of global warming. ""All of this adds to the danger and risk that we face,"" he said. ""Climate change absolutely loads the dice towards more extreme events."" Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories.

" A group of House Republicans on Wednesday launched a new Conservative Climate Caucus aimed at educating fellow GOP lawmakers. Rep. John Curtis, R-Utah., is leading 52 Republicans in the effort, nearly a fourth of all congressional Republicans. “The caucus is a place for Republicans to advance serious climate solutions, but do not ask them to leave their conservative values at the door,” Curtis told reporters on Capitol Hill. “We too want to leave this Earth better than we found it.” The new caucus demonstrates the growing number of Republican lawmakers who say they need to be a part of the climate conversation. The group will organize trips, arrange briefings, and introduce members to leaders in the industry, according to a memo outlining their core principles obtained by NBC News. Curtis, chairman of the new caucus, has been an advocate for climate change solutions since running for Congress but rejects progressive proposals such as the Green New Deal. “Why does the climate question scare you? Are you really content with the label of not caring about the Earth?” Curtis said in an April speech at the Sutherland Institute. “If I utter the word ‘climate,’ why does my wife get panic calls that [I] have gone off the deep end and I’m now in league with AOC?” Environmental policy has become a partisan subject in Washington over the past two decades. In 2019, the Senate launched a bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus led by Mike Braun, R-Ind., and Chris Coons, D-Del. For now, the House caucus will focus on educating Republicans “on climate policies and legislation consistent with conservative values,” with the hope that one day they can work across the aisle to craft meaningful policy. “Climate change should not be a partisan issue. The environment surrounds all of us, and we have a vested interest in protecting, maintaining, and growing it for future generations,” said Rep. Meijer, a member of the House caucus.

" The Great Barrier Reef could have its prestigious World Heritage status downgraded after a report from the United Nations said Australia wasn't doing enough to protect it from the effects of climate change. Australia, which attracts millions of snorkeling tourists and beachgoers each year, vowed Tuesday to fight any change of status that could hurt its travel industry or see the U.N. step in to take tougher measures to reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions. The U.N. World Heritage Committee's draft report Monday found that there was ""no possible doubt"" that the network of colorful corals off Australia's northeast coast was ""facing ascertained danger"" due to climate change. The committee proposed the Great Barrier Reef be added to UNESCO's List of World Heritage in Danger, a move that could create a monitoring role for UNESCO to put in place ""corrective measures"" to reduce emissions, which it said are harming the reef and its marine life. The report said such measures would take into account the fact that Australia ""on its own cannot address the threats of climate change."" Any downgrade of the reef's World Heritage status could also reduce tourism revenue that the natural wonder generates and shake Australians' national pride, along with confidence in their government's ability to care for the coral reef ecosystem. Australian Environment Minister Sussan Ley said Tuesday the country would fight the listing and that she and Foreign Minister Marise Payne had spoken to UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay to express their government's ""strong disappointment"" and ""bewilderment"" at the proposal. ""This is a complete subversion of normal process,"" Ley said. ""The reef is an icon internationally and we are here to fight for the reef and we are here to challenge the decision."" She said that although she recognized the threat of climate change to the reef, Australia would oppose the listing. ""This decision was flawed. Clearly there were politics behind it,"" she told reporters. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics However, environmentalists welcomed the U.N. body's draft decision. ""The recommendation from UNESCO is clear and unequivocal that the Australian government is not doing enough to protect our greatest natural asset,"" Richard Leck, head of oceans for the World Wide Fund for Nature-Australia, said in a statement. The listing would also serve as a wake-up call for the country, he added. ""The prospect of losing the World Heritage status of our reef will be a huge shock for many Australians, but it is a powerful message that our government needs to urgently lift its ambition."" The environmental group Greenpeace Australia Pacific also said the government had to work harder to give the reef a ""fighting chance"" and take its role as an ""environmental custodian seriously,"" spokesperson Martin Zavan said. ""The UNESCO warning could not be any clearer, the Great Barrier Reef is in danger,"" he said in a statement. ""The situation for the reef could easily go from bad to disastrous."" The world's most extensive coral reef ecosystem — a network of 2,500 reefs covering 348,000 square kilometers (216,237 square miles) — has been World Heritage-listed since 1981 and is held in awe by visitors for its dazzling coral and multicolored fish. But scientists have repeatedly warned that its health is under increasing threat from climate change and rising ocean temperatures. The U.N. report found that the site had suffered significantly from coral bleaching and mortality caused by unusually warm ocean temperatures in 2016, 2017 and last year. ""The long-term outlook for the ecosystem of the property has further deteriorated from poor to very poor,"" the draft report said, adding that the deterioration ""has been more rapid and widespread than was previously evident."" The final decision, based on the report's recommendations, will be made in July by the World Heritage Committee and could see the reef added to the list of 53 other sites deemed in danger, in countries such as Afghanistan and Peru.

" PHOENIX — Much of the American West has been blasted with sweltering heat this week as a high pressure dome combines with the worst drought in modern history to launch temperatures into the triple digits, toppling records even before the official start of summer. Record daily highs were seen this week in parts of Arizona, California, New Mexico, Montana, Wyoming and Utah. Phoenix, which is baking in some of the U.S. West’s hottest weather, hit a record-breaking 118 degrees (48 Celsius) Thursday and was expected to reach 116 degrees (46 Celsius) Friday and Saturday. “Very dangerous record breaking heat should continue today across the deserts with well above normal highs,” the National Weather Service’s Phoenix staff wrote on Facebook. “A very good day to stay indoors.” The heat comes from a high pressure system over the West, a buckle in the jet stream winds that move across the U.S. and vast swaths of soil sucked dry by a historic drought, said Marvin Percha, a senior meteorologist for the agency in Phoenix. He and other scientists say the heat wave is unusual because it arrived earlier and is staying longer than in most years. “June last year, things seemed pretty normal,” noted Park Williams, a University of California, Los Angeles, climate and fire scientist. “The record-breaking heat waves came in August and September.” But with such an early heat wave this year, “this could be the tip of the iceberg,” Williams said. A two-decade-long dry spell that some scientists refer to as a “megadrought” has sucked the moisture out of the soil through much of the Western United States. Researchers said in a study published last year in the journal Science that man-made climate change tied to the emission of greenhouse gases can be blamed for about half of the historic drought. Scientists studying the dry period that began in 2000 looked at a nine-state area from Oregon and Wyoming down through California and New Mexico and found only one other that was slightly larger. That drought started in 1575, a decade after St. Augustine, Florida, was founded and before the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock in 1620. The hot weather can be tied to the drought drying out the landscape. Normally, some of the sun’s heat evaporates moisture in the soil, but scientists say the Western soil is so dry that instead that energy makes the air even warmer. “When the soil is wet, heat waves aren’t so bad,” said Williams, who has calculated that soil in the western half of the nation is the driest it has been since 1895. “But if it’s dry, we are under extreme risk.” Scientists say the wildfires that have erupted in recent days have been fed by the excessive heat across the region. Climate change contributes to the drought conditions and makes trees and shrubs more likely to catch fire. At least 14 new wildfires broke out this week in Montana and Wyoming as the record heat sparked an early start to the fire season. Firefighters also battled blazes in Arizona and New Mexico. “From a fire potential standpoint, what is capable this year, it is certainly much more severe than we’ve seen in the past,” U.S. Department of Agriculture fire meteorologist Gina Palma said in a climate briefing Thursday. Palma said the drought-related fire risks were especially pronounced in higher elevations across much of the U.S. West, from the Rocky Mountains down into the Southwest and parts of California. “You will be seeing very extreme fire behavior, certainly conditions that we would not normally see in June,” she said. A growing number of scientific studies are concluding that heat waves in some cases can be directly attributed to climate change, said Kristie L. Ebi, a professor at the Center for Health and the Global Environment at the University of Washington. That means the U.S. West and the rest of the world can expect more extreme heat waves in the future unless officials move to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions, Ebi and other scientists say. A study last month estimated the percent and number of heat deaths each year that can be attributed to human-caused climate change. It included about 200 U.S. cities and found more than 1,100 deaths a year from climate change-caused heat, representing about 35% of all heat deaths in the country. On average each year, Phoenix has 23 climate-triggered heat deaths, Los Angeles has 21 and Tucson has 13, the study said. “Climate change is harming us now,” Ebi said. “It’s a future problem, but it’s also a current problem.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories."
" COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — A container ship carrying chemicals sank off Sri Lanka's capital on Thursday nearly a month after catching fire, raising concerns about a possible environmental disaster, officials said. The ship's operator said the wreck of the Singapore-flagged X-Press Pearl ""is now wholly sitting on the seabed at a depth of 70 feet."" A salvage crew was at the site to deal with any debris and report any spill, X-Press Feeders said. The head of Sri Lanka's Marine Environment Protection Authority, Darshini Lahandapura, also confirmed that the ship had sunk. She said it was currently unsafe to remove the wreck because of rough monsoon seas. ""The sea is very violent. In the rough season, we can't do anything,"" she said. The monsoon season started last month and usually ends in September. ""Until such time, the owner of the vessel has appointed a caretaker company,"" Lahandapura said. ""The entire area will be looked after by the caretaker company until the owner appoints a wreck removal company."" The fire broke out on the vessel on May 20 when it was anchored about 9.5 nautical miles northwest of Colombo and waiting to enter the port. The Sri Lankan navy believes the blaze was caused by its chemical cargo, which included 25 tons of nitric acid and other chemicals, most of which were destroyed in the fire. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics But debris including burned fiberglass and tons of plastic pellets have already polluted nearby beaches. There are concerns that a spill of remaining chemicals and oil from the ship could devastate marine life. Authorities extinguished the fire last week, but the ship then began sinking and attempts to tow it into deeper waters failed when its stern rested on the seabed. The ship had remained partly submerged until Thursday. The government has asked the United Nations and some other countries for help in assessing the damage to the marine environment and coastal areas. The country has submitted an interim claim of $40 million to X-Press Feeders to cover part of the cost of fighting the fire. Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories."
" WASHINGTON — In a setback for President Joe Biden’s efforts on climate change, a federal judge in Louisiana on Tuesday blocked the administration’s temporary ban on new leases to drill for oil and gas on public lands and ordered that lease sales continue. The Interior Department said it would “comply with the decision,” signaling that lease sales to drill in Alaska and in the Gulf of Mexico will likely resume — at least for now. During Biden’s first says in office, his Interior Department paused new leases while reviewing the program to decide whether extracting oil and gas from federal lands and waters should continue in the future, as the president seeks to wean the U.S. off fossil fuels. The Interior Department has held a public forum on the issue and said that an interim report on the future of the program would be coming over the summer. But Louisiana state Attorney General Jeff Landry and 12 other GOP attorneys general sued in March to block the temporary ban, arguing the administration had circumvented legal requirements for carrying out such a move. On Tuesday, Judge Terry Doughty of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana issued a preliminary injunction blocking the administration from enforcing its moratorium. Doughty said his order applies “nationwide.” “Millions and possibly billions of dollars are at stake,” Doughty wrote in a 44-page memorandum accompanying the injunction. “Local government funding, jobs for Plaintiff State workers, and funds for the restoration of Louisiana’s Coastline are at stake. Plaintiff States have a reliance interest in the proceeds derived from offshore and on land oil and gas lease sales.” An Interior Department spokesperson responded to the injunction late Tuesday by saying the administration would keep working on the interim report and the recommendations on how to improve use of public lands and waters to create jobs and “build a just and equitable energy future.” “We are reviewing the judge’s opinion and will comply with the decision,” the department said, without specifying any plans to appeal the injunction. The setback comes as Biden is seeking to rapidly transition the U.S. away from oil, gas and coal, fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming, including by ramping up production of renewable energy sources. A 2018 federal government report found that close to one quarter of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions come from fuels extracted from federal lands. Landry called the judge’s move a “victory” for the rule of law and for energy workers, applauding the court for having “recognized President Biden is completely outside his authority in his attempt to shut down oil and gas leases on federal lands."" The American Petroleum Institute, which represents major oil and gas companies and has opposed Biden’s moratorium, said it was “pleased” by the junction and said halting leasing had harmed the nation’s “security, environmental progress and economic recovery.” “We urge the administration to move expeditiously to follow the court’s order and lift the federal leasing pause,” API Vice President Kevin O’Scannlain said in a statement. As a presidential candidate, Biden committed to “banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands,” a move sought by climate activists who say federal land shouldn’t be used to drill for planet-warming fossil fuels. But despite Democrats’ broad support for his climate goals, Biden has come under intense pressure from some in his own party over the potential ban, especially in New Mexico, where roughly a third of the state is federal land and the public school system is highly dependent on revenues from that drilling.

" MEXICALI, Mexico — Lucía Laguna carries her fate tattooed on her face — from the corner of her mouth to her chin, black lines surf across her coppery skin — the tribal art honoring her people will also serve an important function later on. “After my death, it will guide me to my ancestors. With the tattoo, they will recognize me and can take me where they are,"" she said, as she talks on the banks of the Colorado River. But under the merciless sun, Laguna, 51, worries about the fate of the river and its impact on the Cucapá, her Indigenous people. A searing drought is exacerbating the deadly heat in a region that long ago saw its river flow diminished, after almost a century of U.S. engineering projects, as well as a focus on water for agriculture. ""Cucapá means people from the river, that's why we are fighting for it,"" she said, pointing to a decrease in the river's flow she is seeing every year. “We cling to the river and fight because it gives us water so that the fish can arrive and we can earn our livelihood. But it is a fight that seems that we will never win,"" she said, disheartened. Mexico is experiencing the worst drought in three decades. NASA images from the recently released Landsat 8 satellite showed the extremely low levels of the Villa Victoria dam, one of the capital's main water reservoirs. According to meteorologists, three quarters of the country suffers from drought; in 16 of the 32 states, it affects their entire territory. Thus, 60 large reservoirs, especially in the north and the center, are below 25 percent of capacity. ""Over the past 70 years, the temperature in Mexico has a clear and conclusive increasing trend. In the last decade, it increased very rapidly and that rise is even higher than the average for the planet,"" Jorge Zavala Hidalgo, general coordinator of the National Meteorological Service, said. Rainfall has always fluctuated, he explained, but now the rain is concentrated in fewer days. ""And that is bad because we all want it to rain — but nobody wants it to flood, especially the farmers, because that destroys the crops. That is why we are studying everything that is happening."" The increase in temperature especially affects the forests, which go from being a paradise of greenery to time bombs for fire risks. As of May 5, 562 forest fires had been registered, 27 percent more than in 2020. And the burned area grew 69 percent, reaching almost 900,000 acres. ""There is more drought and therefore the vegetation is waiting for someone to arrive, light a leaf and from there, the fire begins,"" said César Robles, deputy manager of the Fire Management Center of Mexico's National Forestry Commission. ""The area affected by fires is directly correlated with the increase in temperature and the decrease in rainfall."" An area resident, Imelda Guerra Hurtado, 43, pointed to the barren lands of El Zanjón, an arid, semi-desert enclave that reaches the banks of the Colorado River delta. She remembers her grandparents taking her fishing — and points to areas that used to have water. ""Sometimes we feel that we are dying of thirst. Although many deny it, the climate has changed,"" she said. ""We have always lived off the fish in the river, since I can remember. Now we can only fish once a year and it is our main livelihood."" The Cucapá are one of the five native tribes of Baja California, and they descend from the Yuman people, who emigrated to that area around 1000 BC. According to official data, there are now only between 350 and 400 members of the Cucapá people but, in the 19th century, Western colonizers documented between 5,000 and 6,000 nomads who organized into clans. ""You have to understand that these Indigenous people see the entire region, both the part of Mexico and the United States, as their territory. In their traditions, it is remembered that they received a lot of water and, little by little, they were running out of that flow,"" said Osvel Hinojosa-Huerta, director of the Coastal Solutions Program at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. The history of the Colorado River, and the problems it suffers today, is an ode to progress and engineering that tried to tame nature. It is the most important water system in northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States. As with the Nile River in Egypt, it is essential for farming in a semi-desert region. In the 19th century, the river reached Mexico with a wild power of about 42,000 cubic feet per second. At the beginning of the 20th century, however, the United States began struggling to convert the arid regions of the Southwest to arable land, thus undertaking engineering works to divert water to the Imperial Valley of California. ""From 1922, everything started badly,"" Hinojosa-Huerta said. The United States did a study to divide the water from the Colorado River and, coincidentally, it was the 10 wettest years in the basin."" Thus, a distribution was made on paper that included more water (16 percent) than there actually is. And then the reservoirs began to be built. In 1936, the Hoover Dam was inaugurated, between Nevada and Arizona, which lowered the flow to 164 cubic meters per second for Mexico. In 1944, a bilateral treaty was signed that guaranteed Mexico about 1.8 million cubic meters of water per year, but most of it goes to agriculture. The agreement did not consider the rights of the Cucapá people and their ancestral relationship with the river. But it affected their traditional ceremonies, causing a shortage of fruits and grains, and the trees and shrubs used to make houses, boats and clothing. ""Nobody asked us anything, at that time it was as if we did not exist,"" Guerra said. ""There are many companies here that never lack water, one sees the fields of green vegetables and the rest, our land, it is desert."" In 1966, the Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona was erected, and the river's flow decreased to 8 cubic meters per second. But what no one seemed to count on, between treaties and dams, was climate change. ""In Mexicali, it has never rained,"" Hinojosa-Huerta said, ""the flow that reaches the region and that supports agriculture comes from snowfall 2,600 kilometers [1,600 miles] in the Rockies."" It all depends on precipitation in Wyoming and Colorado, but since 2002 snowfall has been below average, depleting the river and resulting in a ""desolating panorama,"" he said. Mexico's Baja California and California share the same geography and climatic conditions. Years of warmer temperatures, a failed rainy season last summer and low snow cover have combined to cause the region's rivers to decline. But heat also kills. In 2019 there were at least eight deaths in Mexicali associated with high temperatures; in 2020, they were 83. ""People cannot live with those temperatures, that is, people die"", Zavala said, ""although they are used to the heat, even small increases break the threshold for the human body to survive."" On Aug. 14, 2020, Mexicali registered 122 degrees Fahrenheit, breaking the record of 121 that dated from August 1981. Froilán Meza Rivera, a veteran journalist and writer from northern Mexico, consulted the archives of the Secretariat of Hydraulic Resources. It appears that in July 1966, in Riíto, a Mexicali community, a thermometer reached an unprecedented figure of 140 degrees Fahrenheit. And that was its limit: the mercury rose to the top and could not measure any more. It would be the highest figure in the world: according to the World Meteorological Organization, the highest recorded temperature is 134 degrees Fahrenheit on July 10, 1913, in California's Death Valley. The region is exposed to the worst possible scenarios in terms of a climate emergency, according to Roberto Sánchez Rodríguez, an academic from the Colegio de la Frontera Norte. ""Governments have mismanaged resources, and that is why there is less water available,"" he said. Since 1993, the fishing territory of the Cucapá has been included in the Upper Gulf of California and the Colorado River Delta Biosphere Reserve, which has a surface area of 2.3 million acres. This protected area was created to preserve the flora and fauna, such as the vaquita porpoises and the totoaba, which are at the brink of extinction. ""We abide by the rules, we know that species have to be protected because we are an Indigenous people, we use the nets and equipment that the government asks of us and we do not go out when it's not our turn,"" said Rubén Flores, captain of a panga, a boat used for traditional fishing. An earthquake in 2010 also affected fishing. ""It left us huge cracks that got bigger, and that doesn't allow us to fish like before,"" said Hilda Hurtado Valenzuela, 68, president of the Sociedad Cooperativa Pueblo Indígena Cucapá, one of the associations that groups together the people who are still fishing. ""Now the ocean currents enter where the old banks of the river used to be, they damage it and we are left without part of our territory,"" said Hurtado, who said she was born on the banks of the Colorado River. Sitting on a plastic chair near the patio of her home in El Indiviso, a semi-desert piece of land, she said she likes to get away from the sun. For a long time, she has not seen the sun as a source of life but as a tough enemy who takes out her tribe, destroys the river and forces them to forces them to do their chores and work at night during the harshest moments of summer. ""The heat here is unbearable, we have never experienced this. There are even people living on the streets who die because they cannot stand the temperatures,"" Valenzuela said. ""And it also affects the animals because less water arrives from the river and the fish breed with the mixture of fresh water and salt, so there are fewer and fewer fish."" The townspeople insist that they do not fish the totoaba, whose swim bladder is considered a delicacy in the Asian market for its supposed medicinal and aphrodisiac properties (a kilo can cost $5,000 in Mexico, and when it reaches China it rises to $55,000 or $60,000). But the intense demand leads to fishing with professional nets, thus also trapping the vaquitas and leaving them on the brink of extinction. Various environmental and journalistic investigations have pointed to the Dragon Cartel, a criminal network with Mexican, American, Chinese and other intermediaries who conspire to exploit and fish the totoaba in that region. Flores said that just by looking at the sky, he knows what the weather will be like. That's why he shakes his head disapprovingly every time he sees the relentless sun. ""Something strange is happening here. It is as if the sun lasts longer, so the fish do not like that heat. They are born less and weigh less."" It used to take them two days to fish for curvina, now it takes them a whole week, he said, looking at the river. The intense drought also has affected the fish's reproduction, so they must go further and further out, with poorly prepared boats, with small engines and without much fuel. ""We comply with everything, but the people of the surrounding towns also fish and don't (comply) —and many times we're punished for that, said Paco, a veteran fisherman with more than 25 years of experience. ""And we must also be careful because the narco is there, they follow our routes through the area and they fish in order to hide tons of drugs underneath. We tell the police, but nobody does anything,"" said Paco, whose last name is being withheld for fear of retaliation. The United States issued a security alert in April for tourists and officials to take great precautions when traveling in and around the city of Mexicali and its rural area due to widespread cartel violence. ""We do not feel safe, we are exposed to everything that is happening because there is a lot of crime. We try to protect ourselves and always be on the lookout for a stranger, because you never know who can attack you,"" Laguna said, with fear showing on her face. Lucia Laguna considers herself a guardian of the Cucapá, keeping alive their language, customs and traditional clothing to preserve them. Her memory is one of the most important reservoirs of the Cucapá past. Kneeling on the banks of the Colorado River, she touches the dark water with special devotion while reciting an ancient song. Two little girls are with her. ""My tata [grandfather] fishes because without that we cannot eat. I too would like to be a fisherman, because I really like the river and being here,"" Marleny Sáenz, 10, said. ""I want the river to stay, to have our traditions,"" she said. ""I like to sing because it is part of me, I feel very proud to be part of this town."" It is a ritual that they used to celebrate on the banks of the river. From time immemorial they burned the cachanilla, a wild plant with a fresh aroma, while chanting their songs so that the fishermen would be lucky in their long expeditions at sea. ""It is about opening paths, so that everything goes well,"" Laguna said. ""We are paying the consequences of the pollution of other people. The people of the cities have to understand that we are affected by what they do. They do not live alone in the world,"" she said sadly, touching the water and singing to the river.

" WASHINGTON — Leaders of the G-7 club of wealthy nations took major symbolic strides toward solidifying global climate action at their U.K. summit, but stopped short of detailing how to confront two of the most pressing challenges: phasing out coal and financing the developing world’s energy transition. With palpable relief after four years of former President Donald Trump, G-7 leaders heaped praise on President Joe Biden and sought to marry their own climate efforts to his domestic political agenda, coalescing under the umbrella of “build back better.” They also rallied behind a pledge to conserve 30 percent of lands and oceans by 2030, a goal Biden had already set for the United States. “You know, we had a president last who basically said, 'It's not a problem, global warming,'"" Biden said in a news conference capping his trip to the summit in Cornwall, England. “It is the existential problem facing humanity, and it's been treated that way.” But climate analysts, eyeing the G-7’s commitment to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, emerged from the summit vexed over the failure to commit to specific steps broadly acknowledged as essential to meeting that goal. Continued burning of coal to generate power, for example, is widely accepted to be counterproductive to averting climate change’s worst effects. “These are the seven countries that have to lead from the front,” said Rachel Kyte, the World Bank’s former special envoy for climate and dean of Tufts University’s Fletcher School. Borrowing a phrase from the ongoing European soccer championship, she added: “It was an open goal, and they missed.” The U.S. and its G-7 allies did re-up their pledge, first made in 2009, to collectively contribute $100 billion per year by 2020 to help poorer nations reduce emissions and fortify themselves against the growing effects of climate change. That $100 billion goal was never met. But the nations recommitted to that figure anyway, while extending the timeline for reaching it to 2025. Yet, the joint communiqué that codifies the agreements reached at the summit included no new specific commitments for how countries would reach that figure. The U.S. is billions behind in actually writing checks for pledges it has made in the past. “They restated a goal that’s been there for a decade, but they didn’t provide clarity about how that was going to be achieved,” said David Waskow, international climate director for the nonprofit World Resources Institute. Some more hopeful signs did emerge in the hours after the summit ended, with Canada announcing it would double its annual pledge to $4.4 billion in U.S. dollars by 2025, and Germany saying it would triple it during that period, to more than $7 billion. “That’s really good to see,” said Rachel Cleetus of the Union of Concerned Scientists. The United States, by contrast, “did not put any clear ambition on the table” with respect to global financing, she added. The G-7 nations did put to paper a pledge to halve their emissions by 2030 and zero them out from their economies by 2050. That marked progress since the most recent G-7 summits, but did not move the ball from what countries including the U.S. have already committed. The United Kingdom and the European Union, in fact, have already pledged to cut much more on an even faster timeline. And while the leaders vowed to “accelerate the transition away from new sales of diesel and petrol cars” to promote electric vehicles, they did not set a deadline to phase out gas-guzzling vehicles, as some countries before the summit had hoped. On coal-fired power plants, the G-7 nations did set a deadline of next year to stop financing “unabated international thermal coal power generation.” That’s significant, considering that the world’s largest emitter, China, continues to fund new coal plants overseas. Yet, the careful phrasing from the G-7 leaders leaves wiggle room to keep financing coal plants that use carbon capture technology to sequester and store carbon dioxide emitted from burning coal. Perhaps the most glaring omission from the G-7 climate agreement, environmental advocates said, was the lack of any deadline for when nations will stop burning coal at home. When the environmental ministers for the nations met virtually in May to lay the groundwork for this month’s summit, they jointly committed to achieving an “overwhelmingly decarbonized power system in the 2030s,” technical-speak for saying heavily polluting coal plants would be phased out by the end of the next decade. But when Biden and other leaders emerged from the meeting, that language was absent from their communiqué, which instead pledged merely to “further accelerate the transition away from unabated coal capacity” without specifying a date. Jason Bordoff, a White House National Security Council official in the Obama administration, said criticism of the Biden administration over that point was misplaced, given that Biden has already set a goal for U.S. electricity to be carbon-neutral by 2035. That goal broadly assumes phasing out coal anyway, along with cleaner-burning sources like natural gas. “All the growth in coal use is in emerging markets and developing economies, so the G-7 agreement not to finance new coal projects is very significant, along with the pledge of assistance to help nations move away from fossil fuels,” said Bordoff, founding director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. Still, the G-7 summit in Cornwall may have been the last, best chance for the world’s wealthiest democracies to increase their leverage over China and other major emitters by uniting behind specific, joint goals well ahead of November. That is when leaders will gather in Scotland for a much-anticipated U.N. climate conference. All of the remaining venues for high-level global diplomacy before that conference — including September’s U.N. General Assembly in New York and October’s G-20 summit in Rome — will include China.

" As a brutal heat wave rips across the country, thousands of workers who toil outdoors face risks of heat stress, with no specific federal standard that covers working in hot environments. Climate scientists and labor advocates are pressing individual states to enhance their worker protections, while federal lawmakers consider two new bills that would create measures such as paid breaks in cool spaces, access to water and limitations on time workers are exposed to heat as temperatures hike to daily record levels. “Extreme heat is a public health crisis and a lot of social and economic inequities come with it,” said Oscar Londoño, executive director of WeCount!, a Homestead, Florida-based immigrant worker advocacy organization. “We see heat disproportionately impacts low-income communities, minorities and seniors,” he said. Workers exposed to extreme heat are particularly vulnerable to illness. Between 1992 and 2017, heat stress injuries killed 815 U.S. workers and seriously injured more than 70,000, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Overall, more than 65,000 people visit the emergency room for heat-related stress a year and about 700 die from heat, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The majority of these cases are concentrated in Florida, where heat drove more than 6,800 people to the emergency room in 2019, a 35 percent increase from 2010, when heat resulted in roughly 5,000 ER visits, according to data from the CDC. In 2012, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration denied a petition submitted by a consumer advocacy group called Public Citizen calling on the agency to set a heat standard in 2012. A second petition from the group is still sitting with the agency. OSHA issued a request earlier this month for information on heat illness as it considers a possible new rule. ""This and the other activities outlined in the Spring 2021 regulatory agenda emphasize OSHA’s renewed commitment to workplace safety and health,"" the Department of Labor told NBC News in an emailed statement. While heat affects workers across a range of industries, U.S. farmworkers are 20 times more likely to die from illnesses related to heat stress than workers overall, the CDC said. As temperatures rise, this figure is estimated to grow. Farmworkers labor through about 21 unsafe working days every growing season when the heat index reaches 84 degrees, according to a March 2020 analysis by researchers with the University of Washington. But by the end of the century, the study estimates, U.S. farmworkers will work an average of 62 days in unsafe conditions. “Heat illness affects workers in our nation’s fields, warehouses and factories, and climate change is making the problem more severe every year,” said U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., who introduced a bill in March that would require OSHA to create an enforceable standard to protect workers from heat. “This legislation will require OSHA to issue a heat standard on a much faster track than the normal OSHA regulatory process. Workers deserve no less,” he said. All workers are covered by OSHA’s “general clause” protections, which require employers to keep workplaces “free from recognized hazards,” including heat. But without a specific standard, workers have no recourse to address heat exposure, said Rachel Licker, a senior climate scientist with the nonprofit organization Union of Concerned Scientists. “It’s a regulation and those aren’t necessarily welcome,” she said, referring to businesses. “But our perspective is that it shouldn’t be regarded as another regulation, because it is affording basic protections.” Allison Crittenden, director of congressional relations with the American Farm Bureau Federation, told NBC News in an emailed statement that farmers prioritize worker safety, including access to water, frequent breaks as temperatures rise and monitoring for illness. “America’s farmers adhere to local, state and federal workforce safety rules and they strive to create a safe and productive environment for all of their employees,"" she said. ""We are concerned with approaches to heat illness protection that take a one-size fits all approach and do not consider individual health needs and regional differences in weather.” The country’s agricultural industry amounts to a $136 billion market, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Largely dominated by several states, including California, Oregon, Washington and Florida, just three have passed state laws that specifically address heat-related worker protections. Florida has failed to pass two bills introduced in the state Senate over the last two years. Some employers have dragged their feet on improving farm conditions for workers voluntarily, Londoño said. Now, the organization is pushing for a countywide standard that would require employers in Miami-Dade County to provide access to water and shade during extreme heat. Jose Delgado, a 72-year-old farmworker based in Homestead, told NBC News that a rule is long overdue. A few years ago during a month of working sweet potato fields during scorching temperatures, he collapsed on his way to cash his check at the bank. He said he had been feeling sick but dragged himself to work every day with a large water bottle because he needed to work. The day he collapsed, the doctors in the emergency room told him he had kidney failure and if he had waited even five minutes longer to get medical attention, he could have died. “I still am afraid for my life because of the heat and I still need to work,” said Delgado, who is undocumented and earns between $100 and $300 a week as a contract farmworker. “I don't receive any kind of health benefits and I’ve been paying taxes since the 1990s. It becomes difficult because I do believe I deserve benefits.” He still doesn’t have access to water or shade. When he becomes too hot, he crawls under his truck for a brief break from the sun. “We are the workers that put food on the table and we suffer through the heat,” he said. “We deserve a pay that is fair and reasonable, and consciousness that we’re putting our lives at risk.” Breaking news emails Be the first to know about breaking news and other NBC News reports.

" Trees are dying. Riverbeds are empty. Lake Mead's water level dropped to its lowest point in history, and Utah's governor asked residents to pray for rain. Water is increasingly scarce in the Western U.S. — where 72 percent of the region is in ""severe"" drought, 26 percent is in exceptional drought, and populations are booming. Insufficient monsoon rains last summer and low snowpacks over the winter left states like Arizona, Utah and Nevada without the typical amount of water they need, and forecasts for the rainy summer season don't show promise. This year's aridity is happening against the backdrop of a 20-year-long drought. The past two decades have been the driest or the second driest in the last 1,200 years in the West, posing existential questions about how to secure a livable future in the region. It's time to ask, ""Is this a drought, or is it just the way the hydrology of the Colorado River is going to be?"" said John Entsminger, the general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority. Greater Las Vegas is one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the country, home to more than 2.2 million people, and it gets just over 4 inches of rain in a good year. Around 90 percent of the water comes from Lake Mead, the reservoir on the Colorado River formed by the Hoover Dam, which is currently 36 percent full. The drought has been so persistent that the Southern Nevada Water Authority and many other groups in the region have spent the last 20 years preparing for a drier future. ""It isn't sneaking up on us,"" Entsminger said. ""Since 2002, our population has increased close to 50 percent, about 750,000 people in the last 19 years or so, and over that same time our aggregated depletions from the Colorado River have gone down 23 percent."" The good news, he said, is that per capita water consumption is down by 40 percent. Indoor water is recycled in southern Nevada, where residents are paid to replace grass with drip-irrigated landscaping. That is one of the region's many ways of confronting a 21st century Colorado River with significantly less water than it had a century ago. Entsminger said the region needs to ""drastically increase our conservation and rethink how we are using almost every gallon of water in order to accommodate that kind of future development."" That includes a new law that will declare more than 30 percent of the grass illegal in southern Nevada. ""The future of the Colorado River in the 21st century is almost certainly significantly less water than we had in the 20th century,"" he said, and it will require collaboration between the U.S. and Mexico. ""The challenge before us is how seven states and two countries can all cooperate to figure out how to get by in the coming decades with significantly less water than we thought we had."" Grass bans won't save the West, especially a place that is in the middle of the desert and surging in population, like Phoenix. Phoenix is the ""bull's-eye of global warming, heating up and drying out,"" said Andrew Ross, a professor of social and cultural analysis at New York University and author of a book about Arizona's largest city called ""Bird on Fire: Lessons from the World's Least Sustainable City."" Before it was Phoenix, the Hohokam Indigenous people lived on the land for centuries. ""They had a wonderful irrigation network system, and they subsisted in the desert with their canal network for more than a 1,000 years,"" Ross said, but severe drought forced them to abandon the site. Phoenix is built atop the ruins of the Hohokam people's city, and the canal system that brings water to Phoenix was built on the path first used by the Hohokam. ""The allegory is built into the city,"" Ross said. The test is whether history repeats itself. Phoenix is a growth-obsessed city dominated by single-family-home real estate development. ""You can't look at the long-term future of those developments without concluding that the challenges will only get greater by the year and with every new subdivision of low-density tract housing that's built,"" Ross said. When he was writing his book on Phoenix 10 years ago, someone described Phoenix to Ross as a city of ""people who are building homes for the people who are building homes."" The metro area's population is almost 5 million, and it's expected to grow by around 2 million in the next 30 years. Utah is in a similar situation. Its population grew by 18.4 percent over the past decade, making it the country's fastest-growing state, according to the latest census data. Amid dangerous drought conditions, we’re inviting all Utahns — regardless of religious affiliation — to join us this weekend in collective and humble prayer for rain.

Farmers, who consume the most water in the state, are no longer flooding fields to irrigate them; instead, they're using more targeted and less wasteful irrigation methods. Utah is so dry that state officials might totally ban fireworks, fearing wildfires. ""I've already asked all Utahns to conserve water by avoiding long showers, fixing leaky faucets, and planting water-wise landscapes. But I fear those efforts alone won't be enough to protect us,"" Gov. Spencer Cox recently said in a statement. To adapt, cities must acknowledge that drought ""is not a temporary condition we can expect to go away, but rather something we have to deal with,"" said John Berggren, water policy adviser for Western Resource Advocates, based in Boulder, Colorado. What does a sustainable Colorado River system look like? ""We have a long way to go"" to answer that question, Berggren said. While it's easy to imagine that the drought spells apocalypse, experts say what prolonged drought really requires is the appropriate response and a willingness to adapt. A report this spring from Arizona State University's Kyl Center for Water Policy argues that ""the perception that Arizona is worst off among the western states is wrong."" Irrigated agriculture consumes 74 percent of the state's water supply. But as populations boom, more farmland is becoming neighborhoods, driving down water use. ""Farming in the Sun Corridor faces a genuine crisis, but that does not necessarily translate into urban shortages,"" the report said. ""Of course, the fact that the Sun Corridor's dominant city is named after a bird that periodically immolates itself clearly invites scrutiny."" It's not that Phoenix won't have water in 20 years, but rather that to ensure that it does, industry might need to rethink why Arizona, which is mostly desert, is one of the top three market-vegetable-producing states. Berggren said it's time to start strategizing, suggesting that states might need to pay farmers to plow their land without seeding it temporarily to destroy weeds and conserve moisture in the soil. ""If push comes to shove, they might need to go out and buy water rights from farmers, and those farms might go out of business,"" he said. That's not an idea to take lightly, and also not one to disregard. ""We can have thriving communities, growing communities, diverse communities in the West. We just have to do it in a different way."" Breaking news emails Be the first to know about breaking news and other NBC News reports. Ben Kesslen is a reporter for NBC News. "
" The annual peak of global heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the air has reached another dangerous milestone: 50 percent higher than when the industrial age began. And the average rate of increase is faster than ever, scientists reported Monday. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the average carbon dioxide level for May was 419.13 parts per million. That’s 1.82 parts per million higher than May 2020 and 50 percent higher than the stable pre-industrial levels of 280 parts per million, said NOAA climate scientist Pieter Tans. Carbon dioxide levels peak every May just before plant life in the Northern Hemisphere blossoms, sucking some of that carbon out of the atmosphere and into flowers, leaves, seeds and stems. The reprieve is temporary, though, because emissions of carbon dioxide from burning coal, oil and natural gas for transportation and electricity far exceed what plants can take in, pushing greenhouse gas levels to new records every year. “Reaching 50 percent higher carbon dioxide than preindustrial is really setting a new benchmark and not in a good way,” said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, who wasn’t part of the research. “If we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, we need to work much harder to cut carbon dioxide emissions and right away.” Climate change does more than increase temperatures. It makes extreme weather — storms, wildfires, floods and droughts — worse and more frequent and causes oceans to rise and get more acidic, studies show. There are also health effects, including heat deaths and increased pollen. In 2015, countries signed the Paris agreement to try to keep climate change to below what’s considered dangerous levels. The one-year jump in carbon dioxide was not a record, mainly because of a La Nina weather pattern, when parts of the Pacific temporarily cool, said Scripps Institution of Oceanography geochemist Ralph Keeling. Keeling’s father started the monitoring of carbon dioxide on top of the Hawaiian mountain Mauna Loa in 1958, and he has continued the work of charting the now famous Keeling Curve. Scripps, which calculates the numbers slightly differently based on time and averaging, said the peak in May was 418.9. Also, pandemic lockdowns slowed transportation, travel and other activity by about 7 percent, earlier studies show. But that was too small to make a significant difference. Carbon dioxide can stay in the air for 1,000 years or more, so year-to-year changes in emissions don’t register much. The 10-year average rate of increase also set a record, now up to 2.4 parts per million per year. “Carbon dioxide going up in a few decades like that is extremely unusual,” Tans said. “For example, when the Earth climbed out of the last ice age, carbon dioxide increased by about 80 parts per million and it took the Earth system, the natural system, 6,000 years. We have a much larger increase in the last few decades.” By comparison, it has taken only 42 years, from 1979 to 2021, to increase carbon dioxide by that same amount. “The world is approaching the point where exceeding the Paris targets and entering a climate danger zone becomes almost inevitable,” said Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer, who wasn’t part of the research.

" A cargo ship laden with chemicals sank Wednesday after nearly two weeks ablaze off the west coast of Sri Lanka, worsening fears of an environmental disaster. The vessel has already covered the coastline in tons of plastic pellets, and it threatens to spill oil into its rich fishing waters. The government has banned fishing, a crucial economic industry, along about 50 miles of coast in the wake of the incident. Authorities have also deployed hundreds of soldiers to clean beaches and have warned residents not to touch the debris because it could be contaminated with harmful chemicals. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics Pamunugama beach, north of the capital, Colombo, is nearly directly opposite where the Singapore-flagged X-Press Pearl has been anchored since a fire erupted onboard May 20. Since then, millions of beadlike bits of plastic have washed up from the fire-ravaged ship and turned the once-vibrant tropical shore into a scene from one of Sri Lanka's worst marine disasters. Marine biologist Asha de Vos, 41, said that when she stepped onto the beach Wednesday, the scene hit her like a brick wall. Where there were once gold sand and coconut trees, she said, there is now a sea of plastic waste. ""I have dedicated my life to protecting and taking care of the ocean around Sri Lanka,"" said de Vos, an executive director of Oceanswell, a marine conservation research and education organization in Colombo. ""We work so hard to look after and protect this,"" she said. ""It was heartbreaking to see it this way."" De Vos said one of the soldiers clearing the pellets at Pamunugama beach told her that they have been taking away as many as 3,000 bags a day. ""But I was watching the waves coming in and just bringing in more,"" she said. Sri Lanka, which is famous for its beautiful coastlines, has emerged as a budding tourism destination in recent years after its civil war ended in 2009. But tourism took a heavy hit from the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2019 Easter terrorist attacks. Fisheries Minister Kanchana Wijesekera tweeted Wednesday that emergency prevention measures were being taken to protect the lagoon and surrounding areas to contain the damage from any debris or in case of an oil leak. A navy spokesman, Capt. Indika Silva, said by phone Wednesday that an effort to tow the ship into deeper waters was not successful and had to be abandoned halfway through, as the rear part of the ship had sunk and was resting on the sea floor while the bow remained afloat. Silva said that water was in the ship and that authorities' main concern was the possibility of an oil spill, although they had not yet observed any oil slicks. ""We stand ready with all necessary equipment to respond,"" Silva said. X-Press Feeders, which owns and operates the ship, confirmed in a statement that efforts to move it to deeper waters away from the coastline had failed. Wijesekera tweeted later Wednesday that booms and skimmers would be used around the vessel in case of an oil spill. There are also contingency plans for full beach cleanups, he said. The fire-ravaged ship was transporting 1,486 containers, including 25 tons of nitric acid, along with other chemicals and cosmetics. As the fire was being extinguished, flaming containers laden with chemicals fell from the deck or broke open on it, spilling their cargo into the sea. ""It's the worst environmental disaster for Sri Lanka,"" Charitha Pattiaratchi, a professor of coastal oceanography at the University of Western Australia, said by phone from Perth, Australia. Pattiaratchi said he was most concerned about the possibility of an oil spill should the ship sink completely, leaking its fuel into the ocean ""sooner or later."" The ship was carrying nearly 300 tons of heavy fuel oil, its owner said. There was also uncertainty about the exact nature of the chemicals in the more than 1,400 containers aboard, he said. The Marine Environment Protection Authority said on its Facebook page Tuesday that six cleanups were being conducted at 14 locations. X-Press Feeders said Wednesday that it was working with local authorities to help clean up the shoreline. Pattiaratchi said that plastic pellets have been a scourge for oceans around the world, with an estimated 230,000 tons entering oceans every year, and that the estimated 3 billion spilled off Sri Lanka are likely to migrate into other parts of the ocean. Pattiaratchi said he expects them to make it as far as Indonesia and the Maldives in the next 40 to 50 days. The pellets, which are notoriously difficult to clean up, are likely to stay in the environment ""for generations,"" he said. Although they are not known to be toxic to humans, Pattiaratchi said, they can endanger marine wildlife by getting caught in the gills of fish or ingested by sea turtles. Television channels in Sri Lanka have been showing dead fish, turtles and other marine life that has washed ashore in recent days. While dealing with the plastic pellets has been challenging enough, de Vos said, an oil spill would add another layer of complexity. ""Imagine this black oil washing up on these beaches, where we now have this plastic snow, basically,"" she said. ""We are hoping we don't have to face that.""

" WASHINGTON — Before he became a climate activist during his freshman year of college, Benji Backer had spoken at the Conservative Political Action Conference, written for right-leaning sites such as TownHall and RedState, and made a name for himself as a conservative commentator on television. But like many other young people, he worried about climate change and didn’t see a place for himself in either the conservative movement, which mostly ignores or denies climate change, or the environmental movement, in which major institutes like the Sierra Club tend to align with Democrats. So in 2017, Backer founded the American Conservation Coalition, which next month is hosting what it bills as the first conservative climate rally. “We want to plant a flagpole in the sand to say, this is an issue conservatives can and should lead on,” he said. “There is absolutely zero path to a zero emissions, climate change-free future without bipartisanship — and anybody who doesn't accept that isn't taking this seriously.” The group has grown to more than 220 branches, many of which are on college campuses, with thousands of grassroots members and relationships on Capitol Hill. The June 5 rally in Miami, a city that could wind up underwater if sea levels continue to rise, will feature like-minded Republicans such as Florida's former Rep. Carlos Curbelo and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who has integrated climate adaptation into all of the city’s long-term planning. “It is no longer an issue of the environment versus the economy; the environment is the economy,” Suarez said. “We hope to serve as a model of how conservative policies can protect the environment, invest in the future, and address the challenges of climate change.” Backer and others say the partisan divide on climate is starting to narrow as people feel the effects of a warming climate and thanks to a rising generation of millennial and Gen Z voters who are far more likely than older Republicans to say human-caused climate change is real and that the government needs to do more about it. Outside the left, many who care about the environment are turned off by what they view as the hectoring rhetoric of climate activists, Backer said. “You have all these groups on the left, and then no groups on the right. That's the market gap that we fit,” he said. “We are really the first and only grassroots movement in this space.” Focusing on more optimistic messages of innovation and local solutions can bring new people into the fold, he said, pointing to billionaire Elon Musk as an example of someone being rewarded in the market while reducing carbon emissions by popularizing electric vehicles. In rural America, there’s a long history of conservation among hunters and fishermen, going back to former President Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican sportsman who founded the national park system, who now feel alienated by the culture of environmentalism and its often abstract goals. “There are so many parts of this country that could be brought in if you can just make it about their backyards, something they can have personal buy-in,"" said Backer, who spent much of last year on a cross-country road trip in a Tesla speaking with local groups. “And with climate change, that's really easy to do that because it's going to affect every community in this country.” On Capitol Hill, a cohort of mostly young Republican members of Congress are pushing the party from the inside and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, despite some uneasiness on his right, just released his own climate plan. It focuses more on government carrots than sticks, such funding for clean energy research, and emphasizes nuclear power and carbon capture technologies, which progressive environments view warily. “This shouldn't be a partisan issue and it should be something that we can find sensible common ground on,” said Rep. Peter Meijer, R-Mich., a 33-year-old who thinks Republicans can champion a free market approach to climate solutions, told NBC News. “But that requires the Democratic Party to not greenwash economic redistribution efforts and it requires the Republican Party to stop denialism.” The American Conservation Coalition has faced predictable criticisms from the left and the right, but has overlapping membership with both youth conservative groups like Turning Point USA and relationships with less politicized environmental groups, like the Nature Conservancy. The group chose Miami for its first rally because it views Florida as an example of conservative leadership on climate. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a loyalist of former President Donald Trump who is eyeing his own 2024 presidential run, just signed legislation to prepare the state for rising sea levels and more severe storms that won overwhelming support in the GOP-controlled Legislature. DeSantis notably did not talk much about climate change around the bill, nor does it address carbon emissions, but that may have helped depolarize the issue. “We can debate all day the whys and how this happens,” Florida House Speaker Chris Sprowls, a Republican, said in response to Democratic criticism that it didn’t go far enough, “but if we just do that and we just debated all day, we wouldn’t do anything.” Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories.

" THE HAGUE — A Dutch court on Wednesday ordered Royal Dutch Shell to significantly deepen its planned greenhouse gas emission cuts, in a judgement that could pave the way for legal action against energy firms around the world. The climate lawsuit, which was filed by seven groups including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth Netherlands, marks a first in which environmentalists have turned to the courts to try to force a major energy firm to change strategy. At a court room in The Hague, judge Larisa Alwin read out a ruling that ordered Shell to reduce its planet warming carbon emissions by 45 percent by 2030 from 2019 levels. Shell currently has a target to reduce the carbon intensity of its products by at least 20 percent by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050 compared with 2016. The court said that Shell's climate policy was ""not concrete and is full of conditions...that's not enough."" ""The conclusion of the court is therefore that Shell is in danger of violating its obligation to reduce. And the court will therefore issue an order,"" Alwin said. The legal case was filed in April 2019 on behalf of more than 17,000 Dutch citizens who say Shell is threatening their human rights as it continues to invest billions in the production of fossil fuels. ""This is a huge win, for us and for anyone affected by climate change"", Friends of the Earth Netherlands director Donald Pols, told Reuters. ""It is historic, it is the first time a court has decided that a major polluter has to cut its emissions,"" Pols added after the verdict, which Shell can appeal. A rapid reduction in emissions would effectively force the Anglo-Dutch firm to quickly move away from oil and gas products. Shell, which plans to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 or sooner, has said court action will not accelerate the world's transition away from fossil fuels. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics The world's top oil and gas trader, Shell has said its carbon emissions peaked in 2018, but intensity-based reduction targets allow it, in theory, to expand its oil and gas output. The plaintiffs claim that Shell's climate strategy is not in line with the U.N.-backed 2015 Paris climate agreement to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Shell says its 2050 net zero target is aligned with the Paris agreement and that it will move ""in step"" with society's progress in the energy transition. It said in a statement before the judgement that it agrees ""that action is needed now on climate change. What will accelerate the energy transition is effective policy, investment in technology and changing customer behavior. None of which will be achieved with this court action.""

" The rye and rapeseed that Rick Clifton cultivated in central Ohio were coming along nicely — until his tractor rumbled over the flat, fertile landscape, spraying it with herbicides. These crops weren’t meant to be eaten, but to occupy the ground between Clifton’s soybean harvest last fall and this spring’s planting. Yet thanks to their environmental value, he’ll still make money from them. Farmers increasingly have been growing offseason cereals and grasses to prevent erosion and improve soil. Now, they’re gaining currency as weapons against climate change. Experts believe keeping ground covered year-round rather than bare in winter is among practices that could reduce emissions of planet-warming gases while boosting the agricultural economy, if used far more widely. “For too long, we’ve failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis: jobs, jobs, jobs,” President Joe Biden said in his April address to Congress. One example, he added: “Farmers planting cover crops so they can reduce the carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it.” Clifton, 66, started growing cover crops several years ago to improve corn, soybean and wheat yields. Then he read about Indigo Agriculture, a company that helps businesses and organizations buy credits for carbon bottled up in farm fields. He signed a contract that could pay about $175,000 over five years for storing greenhouse gases across his 3,000 acres (1,214 hectares). “If you can get something green on the ground year-round, you’re feeding the microbes in the soil and it’s a lot healthier,” he said, touring a barn loaded with cultivating and harvesting equipment. “And if somebody wants to pay you to do that, it looks to me like you’re foolish not to do it.” Agriculture generates about 10 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions: methane from livestock, nitrous oxide from fertilizers, carbon dioxide from machinery. All industries are under pressure to reduce emissions, primarily by switching to renewable energy. But farming has something most others don’t: the ability to pull carbon dioxide, the most prevalent climate-warming gas, out of the atmosphere and store it. Plants use it in photosynthesis, their process of making food. Besides cover crops, promising techniques for carbon storage include reducing or eliminating tillage and letting marginal croplands revert to plains or woods, said Adam Chambers, a U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service air quality scientist. Agriculture won’t be “the sole solution, but I see it as a solid plank in an overall program to address climate change over the next few decades,” said David Montgomery, a University of Washington geologist. The National Academy of Sciences estimates agricultural soils could take in 250 million metric tons (276 million tons) of atmospheric carbon dioxide annually, which would offset 5 percent of U.S. emissions. Some caution against overselling farmland’s potential. Iowa State University ecologist Steven Hall says that at some soil depths, microbes convert carbon absorbed by cover crops into gas that returns to the atmosphere. “It may make sense to pay farmers to do this,” he said. “But I would go into it a bit more suspicious that we’ll get a maximum performance on all farms.” The federal government has spent hundreds of millions of dollars helping farmers make environmentally friendly changes. Since 2005, those actions have produced an eight-fold increase in prevention of greenhouse gas emissions, the NRCS says. The latest U.S. Census of Agriculture in 2017 found more farmers were switching from conventional soil tilling, a big source of carbon pollution, to reduced or no-till practices. It also recorded a 50 percent increase in cover cropping over five years. But the 15.4 million acres (6.2 million hectares) planted in cover crops were just 6.7 percent of the land suitable for it. Biden has ordered the Department of Agriculture to craft a plan for making such practices so common that the U.S. farm industry would become the world’s first to achieve net zero emissions. Secretary Tom Vilsack has pledged bigger payments for pulling marginal lands out of crop production to make way for carbon-absorbing grasses, trees and wetlands. He announced $330 million for local climate partnerships and $25 million for testing new ideas. Supporters say unless the actions are mandatory, which farmers resolutely oppose, more financial incentives will be needed. The agriculture department is consulting industry groups about tapping the $30 billion Commodity Credit Corp., which helps keeps farm incomes and prices stable, to establish a “carbon bank” that could pump in more funds. Republican lawmakers say financing carbon storage should be left to rapidly developing private markets. Indigo Agriculture is among recent arrivals brokering sales of credits for farmland carbon to buyers wanting smaller environmental footprints. Thousands of growers with a combined 2.7 million acres (1.09 million hectares) have signed with Indigo to receive payments for greenhouse gas storage, said Chris Harbourt, head of its carbon program. The Boston-based company’s agronomists help producers adopt the techniques. It uses farm management data, soil sampling and modeling software to calculate credits, based on volumes of gases pulled underground or prevented from being generated. IBM, J.P. Morgan Chase and Barclays are among buyers of Indigo’s credits. Farmers currently get $15 for each metric ton ($15 per 1.1 ton) of carbon with payments phased in over several years. The extra cash is nice but hardly a windfall, said Lance Unger, who recently enrolled 7,500 acres (3,035 hectares) near Carlisle, Indiana. More important is that carbon-sequestering steps also mean bigger yields and profitability from lands packed with organic nutrients, the third-generation farmer said. “I want to make our farm better for the fourth generation,” said Unger, 33, strolling through corn stubble in a field he now tills more lightly than before. He also uses cover cropping and more efficient fertilizing, which reduces nitrous oxide emissions. Still, some farmers are reluctant to change habits ingrained over generations. Others wonder whether carbon markets will work. Pending U.S. Senate and House bills would help farmers get started and provide third-party inspections to verify improvements. The chief Senate sponsor, Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, said attitudes have changed since she unsuccessfully proposed a similar program in 2009. “Farmers have been hit right in the head with one weather disaster after another. They know the climate is changing,” the Democrat said. The measures have bipartisan sponsorship and support from industry groups such as the American Farm Bureau Federation. The Environmental Defense Fund is among green organizations backing it. But an opposing coalition of other environmentalists and small-farm groups says credit markets let corporate polluters outsource carbon reduction instead of mending their own ways. The critics told Congress that farmers who adopt the newer land management practices could abandon them later. “Without adequate measurement tools or guarantees of permanence, quantifying soil carbon to use in a carbon market becomes a guessing game and does not guarantee actual reductions in greenhouse gases,” they said. Bruno Basso, a Michigan State University soil and plant scientist, said farmers are unlikely to resume old ways after seeing how the changes benefit their lands. Carbon storage methods and technology to assess their performance are improving, he added. The NRCS and Colorado State University continue refining an online system that calculates carbon stored and greenhouse gases prevented through conservation efforts. It’s based on factors such as location, soil types, tillage practices, nutrient applications and crop cultivation. Such complex data analysis lends credibility to eco-friendly agriculture, once widely associated with “offbeat farmers,” said Keith Paustian, a soil and crop scientist at Colorado State. “It seems to some degree utopian, but what is best for the planet can also be what’s best for farmers and society,” he said.

" A report by the International Energy Agency says immediate action is needed to reshape the world’s energy sector in order to meet ambitious climate goals by 2050, including ending investments in new coal mines, oil and gas wells. The Paris-based agency said in a report released Tuesday that it has determined there is a narrow but viable pathway for building a global energy sector with net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Several countries, including the United States and the European Union, have pledged to achieve net zero emissions — meaning only as much planet-warming gas is released into the atmosphere as can be absorbed — by mid-century. The IEA report sets out 400 steps needed to transform how energy is produced, transported and used. These include no investment in new fossil fuel supply projects, an end to the sale of new internal combustion engine passenger cars by 2035 and a four-fold increase in the deployment of solar and wind power by 2030 compared to last year’s record level. The IEA’s executive director, Fatih Birol, said the transformation would create millions of new jobs and boost economic growth worldwide. But he warned that while countries and companies have begun to set bold targets targets for cutting emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the coming decades, actual emissions continue to rise substantially. The IEA said last month that 2021 will see the second-largest annual increase in emissions since 2010 as the world economy bounces back from the pandemic. “There is a growing gap between the rhetoric we hear from governments and industry leaders, and what it happening in real life,” Birol said. The agency, whose 30 members are mostly in North America, Europe and East Asia, said the power sector needs to lead the way, with electricity generation achieving net zero by 2035 in advanced economies and worldwide five years later. “Beyond projects already committed as of 2021, there are no new oil and gas fields approved for development in our pathway, and no new coal mines or mine extensions are required,” it said. Dave Jones, an analyst at the energy think tank Ember, said the report’s recommendation mark a turnaround from the IEA’s past position and were “truly a knife into the fossil fuel industry.” Large developing countries such as China, India and South Africa will require help to achieve the report’s suggestion of closing down the most polluting coal-fired power plants by 2030. Laura Cozzi, one of the IEA report’s main authors, said that in addition to a huge increase in renewable power sources and electric car sales, energy efficiency must be increased significantly over the next decade. Power grids and EV charging networks should also be expanded to cope with the shift from fossil fuels to electricity, she said. Her co-author, Timur Gul, said that while the technologies exist to decarbonize the energy sector, they aren’t yet available for sectors such as aviation or heavy industry. “We need to bring them into the market,” said Gul, adding that such future technologies may need to include effective and scalable ways of capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Environmental groups have in the past criticized proposals that rely on unproven technology, arguing that making sharper cuts in actual emissions is a more effective approach. The charity ActionAid warned that the report emphasizes the use of biofuels made from crops. While such fuels are considered a form of renewable energy, they are often produced at the expense of food crops and require large areas of land to grow. But Cozzi said the models in the report don’t require converting forests into cropland. Experts say achieving net zero emissions across all parts of the economy is essential to meet the Paris climate accord’s goal of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century compared with pre-industrial times. The world has already warmed by 1.2 C since the late 19th century, scientists say. Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories."
" The Biden administration will rely on “locally led and voluntary” efforts to meet President Joe Biden’s goal of conserving 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030, the administration said in a report released Thursday. In his first days in office, Biden signed an executive order on ""tackling the climate crisis"" that established the ""30 by 30"" goal and tasked Cabinet officials with drafting a report on how to get there. Although environmental and conservation groups hailed the target as ambitious, the administration did not initially offer specifics about how it would meet that target or how conservation would be defined. The report, titled ""Conserving and Restoring America the Beautiful,"" offers the first look at how the administration believes it can meet the target. It calls on the administration to work with local and tribal governments to create more parks, expand fish and wildlife habitats, boost outdoor recreation and create incentives for fishers, farmers and forest owners to voluntarily conserve some of their land.  ""As the country works to recover and rebuild from the coronavirus pandemic and fully address the climate crisis, now is the time to develop and pursue a locally led, nationally scaled effort to conserve, connect, and restore the lands, waters, and wildlife upon which we all depend,"" says the report. Developed by the Interior, Agriculture and Commerce departments and submitted to Biden’s National Climate Task Force, the report still leaves many details unanswered about how the government will use its dollars and federal powers to promote local conservation. Instead, it lays out principles it says will guide the effort over the next decade, including using Agriculture Department programs to incentivize conservation on working lands and avoiding infringement on Tribal sovereignty or private property rights. Climate and environmental advocates say preserving 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters is critical for protecting biodiversity and endangered species, and will also help fight climate change, because healthy wildlands and oceans sequester carbon dioxide that’s released through human activity. In a memo last month, NRDC President Mitchell Bernard said the plan would “reduce nature’s decline and mitigate the impacts of climate change while ensuring all Americans have access to the natural world.” But many Republicans and some landowners have voiced resistance to conserving such a large swath of U.S. lands and waters, describing it as overreach by the federal government. During a virtual forum that Republicans on the House Committee on Natural Resources held Monday, GOP lawmakers repeatedly described it as Biden’s “radical 30 by 30 land grab initiative.” “In the West, we are all too familiar with government land grabs, and we can smell this one coming from a mile away,” Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., said in testimony that she appeared to deliver from the backseat of a vehicle. The Biden administration approach, laid out in the report, appears to address those concerns by emphasizing the local and voluntary nature of the effort. Still, the Biden administration is expected to take other steps in the coming months to expand protected lands and waters under federal control.  Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, for example, is weighing a decision on whether to vastly expand Utah’s Bears Ears National Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, restoring both to their previous size after they were slashed under former President Donald Trump.

" China’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 exceeded those of the U.S. and the developed world combined, according to a report published Thursday by research and consulting firm Rhodium Group. China’s emissions more than tripled during the past three decades, the report added. China is now responsible for more than 27 percent of total global emissions. The U.S., which is the world’s second highest emitter, accounts for 11 percent of the global total. India is responsible for 6.6 percent of global emissions, edging out the 27 nations in the E.U., which account for 6.4 percent, the report said. The findings come after a climate summit President Joe Biden hosted last month, during which Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated his pledge to make sure the nation’s emissions peak by 2030. He also repeated China’s commitment to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century and urged countries to work together to combat the climate crisis. “We must be committed to multilateralism,” Xi said during brief remarks at the summit. “China looks forward to working with the international community, including the United States, to jointly advance global environmental governance.” Xi said China would control coal-fired generation projects and limit increases in coal consumption over the next five years, with reductions taking place in the five years following that. However, Chinese officials have also emphasized that economic growth, which is still largely dependent on coal power, remains a priority. And the nation is still increasing construction of coal-fired power plants. For instance, the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China together funded $474 million worth of coal projects outside China in 2020 alone. And coal accounted for more than half of China’s domestic energy generation last year, according to Li Gao, director general of China’s ecology ministry’s department of climate change.

" BERLIN — Recent pledges by the United States and other nations could help cap global warming at 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century, but only if goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero” by 2050 succeed, scientists said Tuesday. More than 190 countries agreed in Paris six years ago to keep average temperature increases below that level — ideally no more than 1.5 C (2.7 F) — by 2100 compared to pre-industrial times. The Climate Action Tracker, compiled by a group of researchers who translate emission pledges into temperature estimates, projects that the world is currently set to overshoot the Paris accord’s target by 0.9 degrees. But if 131 countries that make up almost three-quarters of global emissions meet their pledged or discussed “net zero” goal, then the 2-degree target could be met, said Niklas Hoehne of the New Climate Institute. That’s 0.1 C cooler than the previous optimistic forecast the group made in December. Hoehne said U.S. President Joe Biden’s recent ambitious new climate goals had contributed significantly to the revised estimate, along with the European Union, China, Japan and Britain. But the pledges still fall short and have to be further revised going forward, he said. “We have to halve global emissions in the next 10 years,” he said. Asked whether the more ambitious goal of 1.5 C is still within reach, Hoehne said it was technically and politically feasible. Germany has invited about 40 countries to a virtual meeting this week to discuss further international efforts to curb global warming, ahead of a U.N. summit in Glasgow in November. Germany’s top court last week ordered the government to set clearer goals for emissions reduction after 2030. Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories."
" WASHINGTON – The Biden administration used its federal powers to limit emissions for the first time Monday, proposing a rule that would phase out the use of a common refrigerant blamed for driving global warming. Hydrofluorocarbons, known as HFCs and used frequently in air conditioners and refrigerators, are greenhouse gases that trap heat — and do so far more than other gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. The new rule from the Environmental Protection Agency will require the U.S. to ramp down production and import of HFCs by 85 percent over the next 15 years. Phasing out HFCs worldwide is expected to avert up to 0.5 degrees Celsius of global warming by the end of the century, the EPA said, a significant step toward meeting global goals of limiting climate change to 1.5 degrees Celsius. “Put simply, this action is good for our planet and our economy,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said. The move marks the first new regulation proposed by the Biden administration to curb pollutants blamed for global warming, drawing on the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, which was tucked into a massive Covid-19 relief and government spending bill that Congress passed in December and then-President Donald Trump signed into law. As the Biden administration seeks to meet its goal of cutting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions at least in half by 2035, tackling HFCs is among the rare low-hanging fruit, enjoying broad bipartisan support in Congress, as well as buy-in from industry groups.  Initially developed to replace other refrigerants like Freon, HFCs were once viewed as environmentally preferable because they have less of a depleting effect on the ozone layer. A fuller understanding of their ability to trap heat in the atmosphere has since prompted widespread global concern. The Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, a trade group that represents major refrigeration manufacturers, applauded the EPA’s move, saying it would “help create the certainty necessary for U.S. companies to maintain their natural technological advantage.” “It continues our path of industry job creation, innovation and trade, and we are pleased at the signal it sends to the states and to other countries around the world,” its president, Stephen Yurek, said in a statement. The EPA said that phasing in more energy-efficient cooling methods instead of HFCs would save “billions of dollars.” Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said the rule, combined with other climate-related investments in the December legislation, would “create hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs that will combat climate change.” David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council also lauded the move. “Replacing HFCs is a critical and totally doable first step to head off the worst of the climate crisis, and we have safer alternatives ready to go that will save industry money in the bargain,” he said. Phasing out HFCs globally is also called for in the Kigali Amendment, a 2016 update to the 1987 international treaty known as the Montreal Protocol. Shortly after taking office in January, President Joe Biden signed an executive order embracing the Kigali Amendment and starting the process for sending it to the Senate for ratification. The EPA plans to finalize the rule later this year after a 45-day public comment period and a public hearing. Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories.

" Glaciers are melting faster, losing 31 percent more snow and ice per year than they did 15 years earlier, according to three-dimensional satellite measurements of all the world’s mountain glaciers. Scientists blame human-caused climate change. Using 20 years of recently declassified satellite data, scientists calculated that the world’s 220,000 mountain glaciers are losing more than 328 billion tons (298 billion metric tons) of ice and snow per year since 2015, according to a study in Wednesday’s journal Nature. That’s enough melt flowing into the world’s rising oceans to put Switzerland under almost 24 feet (7.2 meters) of water each year. The annual melt rate from 2015 to 2019 is 78 billion more tons (71 billion metric tons) a year than it was from 2000 to 2004. Global thinning rates, different than volume of water lost, doubled in the last 20 years and “that’s enormous,” said Romain Hugonnet, a glaciologist at ETH Zurich and the University of Toulouse in France who led the study. Half the world’s glacial loss is coming from the United States and Canada. Alaska’s melt rates are “among the highest on the planet,” with the Columbia glacier retreating about 115 feet (35 meters) a year, Hugonnet said. Almost all the world’s glaciers are melting, even ones in Tibet that used to be stable, the study found. Except for a few in Iceland and Scandinavia that are fed by increased precipitation, the melt rates are accelerating around the world. The near-uniform melting “mirrors the global increase in temperature” and is from the burning of coal, oil and gas, Hugonnet said. Some smaller glaciers are disappearing entirely. Two years ago, scientists, activists and government officials in Iceland held a funeral for a small glacier. “Ten years ago, we were saying that the glaciers are the indicator of climate change, but now actually they’ve become a memorial of the climate crisis,” said World Glacier Monitoring Service Director Michael Zemp, who wasn’t part of the study. The study is the first to use this 3D satellite imagery to examine all of Earth’s glaciers not connected to ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctic. Past studies either only used a fraction of the glaciers or estimated the loss of Earth’s glaciers using gravity measurements from orbit. Those gravity readings have large margins of error and aren’t as useful, Zemp said. Ohio State University’s Lonnie Thompson said the new study painted an “alarming picture.” Shrinking glaciers are a problem for millions of people who rely on seasonal glacial melt for daily water and rapid melting can cause deadly outbursts from glacial lakes in places like India, Hugonnet said. But the largest threat is sea level rise. The world’s oceans are already rising because warm water expands and because of melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, but glaciers are responsible for 21 percent of sea level rise, more than the ice sheets, the study said. The ice sheets are larger longer term threats for sea level rise. “It’s becoming increasingly clear that sea level rise is going to be a bigger and bigger problem as we move through the 21st century,” said National Snow and Ice Data Center Director Mark Serreze.

" After President Joe Biden took office, corporate America rushed to put out statements boasting of a newly robust commitment to climate change, from going ""net zero"" to becoming ""carbon neutral"" — but with no government oversight of these terms, experts say many of these pledges could risk falling short of legitimate change. In the weeks immediately following the inauguration, Wall Street titans including Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley announced ""net zero"" greenhouse gas emissions goals by 2030 and 2050. Energy giant Royal Dutch Shell doubled down on its previous goal; and BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, said its portfolio companies would need to show how they plan to reach net zero by 2050. While these commitments represent a welcome shift toward corporate action in the face of the growing climate crisis, goals such as “net zero” and “carbon neutral” mean very little when they don’t reduce emissions released by companies in the first place, according to Joeri Rogelj, director of climate change research at the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London. “The challenge here is really that there is no one definition for these terms, particularly ‘carbon neutral’ or ‘climate neutral,'” he told NBC News. “There is no clear scientific definition of what that means. In some contexts, it can mean different things, and that’s why it's important for a company to not just throw out that label but tell people what they're going to do.” For instance, Royal Dutch Shell’s new goal to become net zero by 2050 also includes plans to increase its fossil fuel output in the near term by boosting gas production. To reach its net zero goal, the company plans to offset 120 million metric tons of carbon dioxide through “nature-based” projects. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told clients last year that it would divest from companies that generate more than 25 percent of their revenues from thermal coal production by the middle of 2020. But it still has about $85 billion indirectly invested in coal companies and funds a dozen fossil fuel expansion projects as it transitions its investments to support a low-carbon economy. ""Our conviction is that climate risk is investment risk,"" Matt Kobussen, a spokesperson for BlackRock, told NBC News in part in an emailed statement. ""Among the many initiatives to help our clients navigate this risk, we have both achieved 100 percent ESG integration in our active strategies and, where we have discretion in these strategies, we have fully exited positions in our equity and bond holdings in companies generating more than 25 percent of revenues from thermal coal production."" ""Shell aims to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy products we sell over the next decades to reach 100 percent reduction in carbon intensity by 2050 compared to its 2016 baseline,"" Anna Arata, a spokesperson for Shell, told NBC News in an emailed statement. The company did not respond to an NBC News request for comment on its increase in gas production. The Environmental Protection Agency requires greenhouse gas emissions reporting across 8,000 gas suppliers and CO2 injection sites in the United States. But it does not have a program that requires companies to report greenhouse emissions stemming from electricity consumption, Enesta Jones, a spokesperson for the agency, told NBC News in an emailed statement. Earlier this month, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said Biden plans to issue an executive order requiring financial institutions and companies to disclose climate change risks. Some multinational companies still have a long way to go to deliver on their climate change promises, according to Climate Action 100+, an investor-led initiative that advocates for climate-related resolutions and holds companies accountable for failing to address climate risk. The group recently analyzed 159 company climate goals and found only six companies explicitly tied future capital expenditures to their long-term emissions reduction targets. Only 10 percent of companies use climate-scenario planning to help limit global warming to under 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels. The lack of universal requirement for reporting emissions leaves room for variation when it comes to how companies track, calculate and report on their goals, said Robert Schuwerk, executive director of the North American office of Carbon Tracker, a nonprofit financial think tank focused on climate risk and the energy industry. “A lot of people think, 'Let's add up emissions like you add up dollars in your bank account,'” Schuwerk said. However, “If I'm a company and I'm accounting for oil that auto users combust, that's their emissions that are my emissions. I think it's more valuable to cast a wide net and make it more responsible across the supply chain.” Industry giants such as Microsoft and Ikea are frequently cited as examples of rigorous goal setting in the corporate world, according to Rogelj. Microsoft announced last year it will be carbon negative by reducing its direct and indirect emissions through investments in clean energy technologies. Similarly, Ikea uses the term “climate positive” to describe its goal to reduce more emissions than it produced by 2030. The furniture giant reported last year that it reduced emissions by 4.3 percent in fiscal year 2019 to 24.9 million tons of carbon. “From a financial perspective, how do you get buy-in?” said Jennifer Keesson, sustainability manager for Ikea U.S. “It’s really a part of our ethos and we know that this is necessary to be able to contribute and sustain ourselves.” Not all industry watchers are critical about recent corporate climate announcements. Phil Duffy, executive director of Woodwell Climate Research and a former climate science adviser under President Barack Obama, said it is “fantastic” that companies are now doubling down on efforts to combat climate change. “Big picture: I feel encouraged by the clear awakening by the private sector about the risk of climate change, and there is a real sense of motion across the private sector about being a part of the solution,” he said. “You can be cynical about it and say there is greenwashing — but I can tell you a lot is genuine.” Breaking news emails Be the first to know about breaking news and other NBC News reports.

" From Big Oil to Big Tech, companies are rushing in to a new kind of business they believe will keep their industry surviving in the new net-zero economy: carbon capture. So-called carbon capture initiatives typically involve actively drawing carbon dioxide out of the air or scrubbing the heat-trapping greenhouse gas out of the emissions from factories and power plants. While the technology has been used for decades by oil manufacturers to pump more oil, only in the last several years have other industries started to embrace the technology as a way of combating climate change. With the oil market still fragile after inventories reached historic highs early in the pandemic, carbon capture has become a major draw for fossil fuel titans as they scramble to stay afloat in a new green economy. Darren Woods, chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil, told investors in March the company expects the market for carbon capture to grow by 35 percent each year, reaching $2 trillion by 2040. The company this week proposed a $100 billion carbon capture hub in Houston that it estimates would capture and store about 50 million metric tons of carbon a year by 2030 and possibly 100 million metric tons by 2040. ExxonMobil is urging President Joe Biden to introduce tax breaks and a price on carbon that will help create a market for the company's new carbon capture business. BP plans to capture up to 10 million tons of carbon each year through its carbon capture project in North East England called Net Zero Teesside. “CCUS technology (carbon capture, utilization and storage) is ready to deploy now,” Joshua Hicks, a spokesperson for BP, told NBC News in an emailed statement. “We will continue to work with governments and corporations to create the business models essential for scaling up carbon capture deployment.” Microsoft is exploring carbon capture through a negative emission project at a biomass plant in Denmark, the company announced last month. Tide, owned by Procter & Gamble, is studying carbon capture technology as part of its commitment to halve greenhouse gases at its plants by 2030. LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton director Antoine Arnault told investors last week that it will reduce its carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2026 through using 100 percent renewable energy and helping to “improve the soil's ability to capture carbon.” “This is an ambitious project, but we need to have a holistic approach,” Arnault said. The demand for carbon capture technology has boomed since 2018, when the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a report that said the world would need to take “unprecedented” steps to avert the most catastrophic effects of climate change. The report warned that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100 will require “large-scale deployment of carbon dioxide removal measures.” It may be necessary to remove up to 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year by 2050 to keep warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Climate models have suggested that even after transitioning to renewable energy and adopting other mitigation measures, it may be necessary to remove up to 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year by 2050 to keep warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. That stark realization has fueled something of a paradigm shift, said Peter Kelemen, a professor of Earth and environmental sciences at Columbia University. “People’s thinking has evolved in terms of assessing the value of mitigation,” he said. “It comes from a clear-eyed assessment of what it takes to get global warming below 2 degrees C. There’s the thought that we should spend whatever it takes to keep warming below that level.” But some scientists and industry watchers say that without carbon pricing, capturing carbon can become too costly and difficult to scale up. By one measure, an estimated 2,000-plus large-scale carbon capture facilities must be deployed by 2050, requiring hundreds of billions of dollars in investment and a hundredfold increase in the number of carbon capture and storage facilities in operation, according to Guloren Turan, general manager of advocacy with the Global CCS Institute, a climate change think tank. To capture carbon from flue gas, a liquid solvent is used to absorb the carbon dioxide. Then the mixture is heated to remove the carbon dioxide for storage, which requires staggering levels of energy, said Joan Brennecke, a professor of chemical engineering at The University of Texas at Austin. “We need to have cap-and-trade or a carbon tax,” she said. “There needs to be incentives for companies to invest money in this.” At the federal level, Biden aims to cut the country’s greenhouse gas emissions in half, compared to 2005 levels, by 2030. To reach that goal, the administration announced a new international climate finance plan on Thursday that would spur the private sector to contribute to climate solutions across the country and developing nations. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Thursday the agency has requested $1.2 billion from the administration for the green climate fund to spur private investment and $485 million to fund multilateral climate initiatives. ""We need to ensure that the financing will be there, both public and private, to meet the moment on climate change, and to help us seize the opportunity for good jobs, strong economies and a more secure world,"" Biden said Thursday. Whether more clean energy policy at the state and federal levels will be enough to decarbonize the grid by 2035 remains to be seen, said Adam Wilson, U.S. renewable energy analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence. “Current market forces will take the industry a long way on the path of a clean energy sector,” he said. “But it will likely take breakthroughs in emerging technologies to get to the finish line.” Breaking news emails Be the first to know about breaking news and other NBC News reports.

" When the San Francisco Bay Area experienced a record 30 consecutive days of worrisome air quality alerts in August and September, Mary Prunicki began taking blood samples from firefighters. The sky had turned orange from nearby wildfires. Thousands of firefighters would spend months battling the blazes, which would eventually scorch more than 4 million acres and kill 31 people. And the damage isn't likely to have stopped there. Prunicki, director of air pollution and health research at Stanford University's Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research, is studying the blood samples to understand what wildfire smoke does to human health. It's part of a growing body of work that illustrates how wildfire seasons made worse by climate change threaten not just immediate destruction but also long-term health. She and other scientists are particularly concerned about a type of particulate matter in wildfire smoke known as PM2.5. These tiny airborne particles, about one-twentieth the width of a human hair, are especially dangerous because they can be breathed deeply into the lungs. ""The size of that particulate can, when you inhale it, go all the way to the base of your lungs and then cross over into your bloodstream,"" Prunicki said. “Once it's in the bloodstream, it can go to various organs and do all kinds of damage."" Experts have said that in a warming world, devastating wildfires like the ones that tore across California, Oregon and Washington last year will be more common. Around the world, wildfire seasons have been starting earlier and lasting longer, becoming in some regions an almost year-round threat. In addition to being more frequent, studies have shown that climate change is making the blazes more intense and destructive. The results of Prunicki's study are forthcoming, but a clearer picture is emerging of just how damaging wildfire smoke can be to humans, and scientists are sounding the alarm over a problem they say is only going to get worse with climate change. ""In the climate science community, we've been predicting these types of impacts for decades now,"" said Tom Corringham, an environmental economist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. Corringham co-authored a study published last month in the journal Nature Communications that found that airborne particles in wildfire smoke can be several times more harmful to human respiratory health than other forms of air pollution, including car exhaust. It's not yet well understood why wildfire smoke is more harmful than other forms of ambient air pollution, although it is likely to have something to do with the chemical composition of what's being burned, Prunicki said. Wildfires that engulf homes and other buildings, for instance, can be particularly dangerous because the chemicals in furniture, clothing and other everyday items are released. In some cases, the materials in firefighters' protective gear can also release harmful particulate matter. Tony Stefani, a retired San Francisco fire captain, knows the risks well. Stefani, who in 2006 founded the San Francisco Firefighters Cancer Prevention Foundation, was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer. He recalled wondering whether his illness was somehow linked to his line of work. ""I knew there was definitely something wrong,"" Stefani said. ""And I thought there was a direct correlation between what I had and my exposures on the job."" Many of his colleagues, Stefani said, accept that developing cancer is not a matter of if but when. Studies by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have shown that firefighters are at higher risk of cancer and cancer-related deaths compared to the general population, but researchers want to know why — and how best to protect them. Through his foundation, Stefani works to spread the word about early detection and prevention, but he's also involved with scientific efforts such as Prunicki's research to better understand how exactly wildfire smoke affects immune functioning and human health. While firefighters are among the most vulnerable when it comes to smoke exposure, it's not just those on the front lines battling blazes who are feeling the impacts of more frequent and intense wildfires. Studies have observed increases in hospitalizations, particularly for respiratory conditions, during wildfire events. In their study, Corringham and his colleagues combed through 14 years of hospital admissions records in Southern California, analyzing them together with satellite data on wildfire smoke and wind. The researchers discovered that an increase of PM2.5 pollution from wildfire smoke caused respiratory-related hospital admissions to increase by 1.3 percent to 10 percent. An increase in PM2.5 from other sources of air pollution, on the other hand, contributed to only a 1 percent rise in hospital admissions. Their findings suggest air quality standards may need to take into account differences in toxicity between different forms of air pollution, said a co-author of the study, Rosana Aguilera, a postdoctoral researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. ""If there are different impacts of PM2.5 on health, depending on where this PM2.5 is coming from, then we should study that further and reflect that in standards and policies for air pollution,"" she said. A study published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Dermatology also found that wildfire smoke can exacerbate more than just respiratory conditions. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco observed a rise in the number of patients visiting health clinics for eczema and other general skin concerns in November 2018, when the catastrophic Camp Fire raged in Northern California. The scientists found that even short-term exposure to hazardous particulate matter in wildfire smoke can have consequences for skin health. The studies of the health effects of wildfire smoke paint a concerning picture of a future in which climate change is expected to supercharge wildfire seasons. That realization, Stefani said, makes his foundation's collaboration with scientists all the more important, because science can help advocates push for safer working conditions and better public health measures. ""They're the impetus for change,"" Stefani said of the studies. ""That is the reason that we know there's a problem. When we have the scientific proof that something's wrong and we have the numbers to show it, change can occur. And that's really, really important.""

" SAN JOSE, Calif. — Miguel Alarcon made a habit of wiping down his white Ford pickup truck parked in the driveway of his East San Jose home in California. Like clockwork, a layer of grey film appeared on his car every few days, which he believed was an accumulation of exhaust from leaded-fuel planes flying overhead in and out of Reid-Hillview Airport. “My car was always dirty from the pollution,” said Alarcon, 42, who lived across the street from the airport from 2014 to 2017. While he lived there, Alarcon said, he also struggled with respiratory issues. His doctor prescribed antibiotics to treat his breathing problems. But when his sneezing didn’t stop, his doctor recommended he move far from the airport in East San Jose, an area where 2.5 percent of children under 6 years old who were tested had detectable levels of lead in their blood, according to the California Department of Public Health's most recent figures, from 2012. He moved out for a price; his rent jumped from $800 to $1,700 a month. “The problem is sadly it's very expensive here [in San Jose],” said Alarcon, who earns $5,000 a month after taxes as a roofing contractor. “In the airport area, in each house, there are two to three families because it’s so expensive.” With rent costing more than $3,200 on average for a three-bedroom home in San Jose, many working-class people like Alarcon have been forced into making a wrenching decision: pay more affordable rent but endure poorer air quality. That’s because Reid-Hillview is one of 13,000 so-called general aviation airports, from which leaded-fuel piston-engine aircraft fly. While leaded gasoline was fully phased out in 1996 with the passage of the Clean Air Act, it still fuels a fleet of 170,000 piston-engine airplanes and helicopters. Leaded aviation fuel, or avgas, now makes up “the largest remaining aggregate source of lead emissions to air in the U.S.,” according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The presence of this fuel means the areas near these airports are often inundated with tiny lead particles, according to a 2020 report from the EPA. Lead has been proven to have a detrimental impact on children’s brains and nervous systems. After 15 years of research, the EPA said it would issue a ruling, known as an “endangerment finding,” in 2018 that would unlock a legal mandate to start driving down leaded aviation fuel. But it has yet to do so. “EPA will follow the science and law in developing any future decisions regarding lead emissions from piston-engine aircraft,” said Enesta Jones, an EPA spokesperson. For now, leaded aviation gas appears to be caught in a bureaucratic limbo: stuck between not meeting the environmental demands of the EPA and the commercial realities of the aviation community. It is the primary viable option for this type of aircraft, as the general aviation community argues it remains critical given the needs of the current fleet. “Fuel and emissions are governed by the federal government,” said Eric Peterson, county airports director with the County of Santa Clara, which owns Reid-Hillview. “So until they come up with an alternative fuel, there is a limited amount the county can do to address that.” Meanwhile residents continue to live with the air quality that comes with living near an airport where small planes burning leaded fuel fly in and out, said Alarcon, who is also a volunteer organizer with the nonprofit tenant advocacy group Vecinos Activos. It’s also unclear to air quality experts and residents what is arguably safe. “There is no bright line that says 'Above this concentration lead is safe and below this concentration' that it is not. You’d have to make a policy decision,” said Jay Turner, an engineering education professor at Washington University in St. Louis and member of the EPA’s Science Advisory Board. “We’re really careful to come back to this point that just because public areas might meet the EPA standard [for lead] doesn't mean zero risk or zero concern.” Piston-engine airplanes have been a mainstay in aviation since they were first introduced in the early 20th century, according to Walter Desrosier, vice president of engineering and maintenance with the aviation industry group General Aviation Manufacturers Association. Since World War II, piston engines have been widely used by pilot hobbyists, aviation students and government agencies because of their high-performing engines and reliability to stay aloft amid rapid changes in temperature, pressure and altitude. They also cost less at $400,000 to $500,000. “The type of mission or purpose of using a piston engine might not be served well with a jet,” Desrosier said. When the EPA first tackled removing lead emissions from engines, it focused on the biggest polluters: cars. At the time, the automotive industry made up the vast majority of airborne lead, with piston-engine airplanes responsible for only about 5 percent of emissions. Technological advances in auto engines, such as cooling liquid, also made way for a new market for unleaded fuel. But there were no alternatives for piston engines, so they were largely left out of federal regulation. Piston-engine aircraft are now the largest single remaining source of airborne lead, according to a 2016 EPA study. Approximately one-quarter of the piston-engine fleet are estimated to “consume more than half of all avgas,” according to a January report by the National Academy of Sciences. While scientists, community members and aviation industry advocates agree that lead emissions from these planes are harmful to human health, their users note they play a big role in search-and-rescue efforts, training pilots who go on to fly large commercial jets and filling a recreational market for flying. Public safety agencies, however, which account for one-quarter of piston-engine planes registered with the Federal Aviation Administration, are “likely to consume more than half of all the avgas used by the fleet,” according to the January National Academy of Sciences report. These agencies often include law enforcement and firefighting aircraft that need to reliably stay aloft through rapid changes in temperature, pressure and altitude. Personal and recreational flyers make up the remaining three-quarters of planes and consume the other half of leaded gas. For instance, Colorado State Patrol owns five piston aircraft that it uses for flying doctors and state personnel and to carry out law enforcement operations, according to Sgt. Blake White, an agency spokesperson. But the state patrol’s planes are based out of Colorado’s Centennial Airport, where federal workplace enforcement inspectors found “elevated” blood levels of lead in workers and a child who spent time in the repair shop. The agency declined to comment on the findings. While flight schools, agricultural companies and individual pilot hobbyists also regularly use these aircraft, their owners often agree they wish they could use an alternative to leaded fuel. Jason Jeffery, owner of Pacific Air Flight aviation school, said his school owns seven Cessna 172 piston-engine airplanes to train pilots out of Long Beach Airport. That airport emitted more than 1,500 pounds of lead in 2017, according to data from the EPA. Jeffery said he would switch the school’s fleet to an unleaded fuel alternative if it were reasonably priced and did not require buying new engines. “There is no option and [lead fuel] is all you can use,” Jeffrey said. “I feel very guilty that we’re burning lead.” But there are also many white-collar professionals, doctors, lawyers and software engineers who have registered piston-engine planes with the FAA. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, a general aviation professional organization that declined to comment for this article, reports on its website that its members are generally well-off, with an average net worth of $1.6 million and nearly half owning more than two homes. These users of piston engines say their planes are also put to good use. John McGowan, a board member of the nonprofit Community and Airport Partnership for Safe Operation, is a retired vice president of Agilent Technologies and an advocate for keeping Reid-Hillview Airport open. He said about 60 percent of his flight time in his Piper Comanche 180 is purely recreational. The other 40 percent of his flight hours are what he calls “public benefit,” such as volunteer flying with organizations that transport rescue animals and fly children for free to encourage them to consider aviation careers. “It’s not about a privilege any more than a fire station or police station or car garage,” he said. “It provides a gateway in and out of the community. It provides a gateway to careers in aviation and a learning gap to students.” But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds that lead exposure remains incredibly dangerous and that “no safe blood lead level in children has been identified.” The EPA and FAA began making headway in 2013 with a research and development program to find an alternative unleaded fuel for piston aircraft, given the dangers of lead. But the Trump administration slowed down research into leaded fuel, said Desrosier, of the General Aviation Manufacturers Association. A study published in 2011 conducted by three researchers from Duke University found that “children living within 500 meters of an airport at which planes use leaded avgas have higher blood lead levels than other children,” with this effect observable out to a full kilometer away from the airport. Bruce Lanphear, a professor of health sciences at Simon Fraser University in Canada who is also an expert in lead poisoning, said these health effects compound existing disparities between hobby pilots and low-income residents who often live near these airports, since hobby pilots use nearly half of total leaded fuel. In the case of San Jose’s Reid-Hillview Airport, there are numerous locations nearby where children live and spend time, like a nearby city park, a Boys & Girls Club, a preschool and several schools. “You have this luxury item that benefits the upper class and is potentially or is harming the minority lower-income populations,” Lanphear said. Over the last 15 years, the EPA, which is responsible for phasing out leaded gas, has made little substantial progress even when faced with public pressure, according to Marcie Keever, an attorney with an environmental advocacy organization Friends of the Earth. In 2006, her organization fileda formal “petition for rulemaking” to the EPA asking the agency to determine that “lead emissions from general aviation aircraft endanger public health and welfare.” If such a rule had been enacted, that would have kicked off a process to forcefully reduce airborne lead across the United States, Keever said. While the private sector has made some efforts to introduce newer unleaded fuels for piston-engine planes, lead avgas remains the dominant fuel. That’s because it’s complicated to find a safe alternative to lead in aviation gasoline, and the market is slim for oil manufacturers to offer this type of fuel, said Dick Knapinski, a spokesperson for the aviation enthusiast group Experimental Aircraft Association. To compare, 209 million gallons of leaded aviation gas was sold in 2017, while more than 1.5 billion gallons of jet fuel was sold that same year, according to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. “It’s such a small market for aviation fuel that it has to be something that the fuel company won’t lose money on,” Knapinski said. “Everybody wants the same thing. We want to find a solution to get unleaded fuel, but it is somewhat complex.” Still, one notable sign that the EPA may take a more forceful approach is President Joe Biden’s recent nomination of a top environmental advocate to the EPA. Marianne Engelman Lado, an environmental lawyer who worked for Earthjustice from 2010 to 2016 and spearheaded Earthjustice’s lobbying efforts and litigation on the avgas issue, has been serving since February as a deputy general counsel at the EPA. (However, Lado was hired to work in the agency’s Office of General Counsel and not for the Office of Air and Radiation, the portion of the EPA that deals with airborne lead.) In November, the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors approved plans to close Reid-Hillview Airport when federal funds expire in 2031. But local recreational pilots and emergency response units that use the airport have raised concerns that its closure will hurt vital parts of rescue and wildfire operations and clog surrounding airports with traffic, according to a local group called Save Reid-Hillview Airport. McGowan, with Community and Airport Partnership for Safe Operation, said airborne lead rarely exceeds the EPA’s lead emission standards outside of the airport boundaries. He added that the organization doesn’t believe the airport “is a health hazard or safety hazard for the surrounding community.” “On a safety level, there is no argument to be made that it's a safety hazard for the community,” he said. “It’s been proven it is the safest possible use of the lot.” Maricela Lechuga, newly appointed commissioner on the Santa Clara County Airports Commission and an attorney with the Law Foundation of Silicon Valley, said proponents who want to keep the airport open are putting their self-interests above the health of local Latino children. “I understand why they are so passionate about keeping it, but I don’t think it’s worth the expense,” said Lechuga, who advises the Board of Supervisors. “We are in a housing crisis, and maybe that land could be better used.” Alarcon’s breathing has eased since he moved about 10 miles from the airport four years ago. But he wishes he did not have to move to heal. “It’s not fair,” Alarcon said. “It's because of them it's so expensive here, and Latino families have to live with the problems with the airport.” CORRECTION: (April 23, 2021, 09:20 a.m. ET): A photo in an earlier version of this article misidentified the city in an aerial view.

" The U.S. aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 as part of its new commitment to the Paris climate agreement, President Joe Biden announced Thursday. Biden made the pledge, called the ""nationally determined contribution,"" while speaking at a two-day virtual climate summit attended by dozens of world leaders Thursday morning. Biden rejoined the 2015 climate pact in February, reversing a decision by President Donald Trump to withdraw the U.S. from the global coalition to curb carbon emissions. ""These steps will set America on a path of net zero emissions economy by no later than 2050,"" Biden said in remarks from the White House. ""But the truth is, America represents less than 50 percent of the world's emissions. No nation can solve this crisis on our own, as I know you all fully understand."" The president emphasized that scientists say the current decade will be decisive for addressing the climate crisis. ""This is the decade we must make decisions that will avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis,"" Biden said, adding, ""We can't resign ourselves to that future. We have to take action on this, and this summit is our first step on the road we'll travel together."" U.S. emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases plunged last year, but that was an anomaly owing to the coronavirus pandemic, which put the brakes on large segments of the economy. As the country rebounds, emissions are expected to rise once again, and the Biden administration is racing to find ways to put the U.S. on track to meet even more ambitious targets that scientists say are needed to avert the worst effects of global warming. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Thursday that Biden's agenda for the virtual climate summit “reportedly is to encourage them to expand their country's Paris climate agreement commitments to meet even more ambitious emissions goals.” “The problem, of course, which our colleagues no doubt remember is the hollowed commitments the countries made back in 2015 carry no serious means for enforcement,” he continued in remarks on the Senate floor. “But many of the signatories within the supposed deal have largely ignored their stated commitments and continue to emit with reckless abandon. As the Biden administration climate envoy John Kerry once lamented, quote, most countries are not getting the job done and living up to Paris, end quote. China, for example, has just kept emitting more and done it shamelessly.” The Biden administration has been under immense pressure from environmental groups and climate scientists to commit to an emissions cut of at least 50 percent, compared to 2005 levels. Cutting emissions in half globally by 2030 is seen as necessary if the world is to meet U.N. goals to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The most ambitious emissions-cutting goal the U.S. has set to date, Biden's expected pledge of a cut of 50 percent to 52 percent, is still likely to face criticism from environmental groups that say it falls short of restoring the U.S. to a position of leadership. The European Union, for example, has pledged at least a 55 percent cut by 2030, while the U.K. has promised 68 percent by 2030 and a whopping 78 percent by 2035. The U.S. is pressing the world's largest emitters, all of whom were invited to the summit, to make equally ambitious cuts. But after Trump abandoned the Paris Agreement, other countries are closely scrutinizing U.S. actions to see whether Washington will back up its tough talk with action and whether that action will be politically durable. China's President Xi Jinping, the first world leader to speak at the summit, reaffirmed that his country aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 and would, he said, ""strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030."" The commitments are not a new pledge, but are seen as ambitious for China, which is the world's biggest carbon emitter. Still, China's targets fall behind those of other developed nations. Several heads of state urged countries to accelerate their ambitions to reduce emissions. “We need to move more quickly to implement commitments for 2030,"" France's President Emmanuel Macron said. ""Basically, 2030 is the new 2050."" Without making any concrete commitments in his speech at the summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he set the goal of significantly limiting the volume of net emissions in Russia by 2050 in his state-of-the-nation address on Wednesday. “The fate of our entire planet, the development prospects of each country, the well-being and quality of life of people largely depend on the success of these efforts,” Putin said of international efforts to tackle climate change. He said that compared to 1990, Russia has reduced greenhouse gas emissions to a greater extent than many other countries, going from 3.1 billion tons of CO2 to 1.6 billion tons. Putin said it’s not enough just to talk about new emission volumes, but nations must deal with the absorption of carbon dioxide accumulated in the atmosphere, adding that Russia makes, “a colossal contribution” to the absorption of global emissions, both its own and those of others, due to the absorbing capacity of its ecosystems. He also called for the reduction of methane emissions, saying each ton creates a greenhouse effect 25–28 times greater than a ton of CO2. Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, who has been heavily criticized for his management of the Amazon rainforest, committed to eliminating illegal deforestation in the country by 2030 and pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Bolsonaro's statements Thursday mark a departure from his previous stance on climate change. While campaigning for the presidency in 2018, Bolsonaro said that, like Trump, he would withdraw from the Paris Agreement and he often criticized what he considered excessive policing of the country's forests. Many leaders praised the U.S. for rejoining the Paris Agreement, noting the difference between Biden's actions on climate change compared to his predecessor. Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi called it, ""a complete change."" ""I'm delighted to see that the United States is back to work together with us in climate politics, because there can be no doubt about the world needing your contribution,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said, adding that Biden's commitments are sending an ""important message to the international community."" During the virtual summit, Biden also announced a new international climate finance plan that he said would offer a coordinated way to fund the global response. He argued the initiative will spur the private sector to contribute to climate solutions both in developing nations and in the U.S. ""Good ideas and good intentions are not good enough,"" Biden said. ""We need to ensure that the financing will be there, both public and private, to meet the moment on climate change, and to help us seize the opportunity for good jobs, strong economies and a more secure world."" U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen highlighted the administration's $1.2 billion request for the green climate fund and $485 million to fund multilateral climate initiatives. She added that her department is focused on ways to mobilize private investments to create a greener global economy. Biden administration officials told reporters in a briefing before the announcement that the U.S. will also consider a ""carbon border adjustment,"" better known as a carbon tariff, in which the U.S. would tax imports from countries that don't have similar emissions controls. Although the U.S. trade representative's office under Biden has floated the idea before, others in the administration, including climate envoy John Kerry, have warned against it. The previous U.S. pledge for the Paris Agreement, set by President Barack Obama before Trump withdrew the U.S. from the deal, was a cut of 26 percent to 28 percent by 2025. As part of the Paris accord, which is not legally binding, countries are supposed to regularly update their pledges, with 2030 goals due ahead of a U.N. climate summit in November in Scotland. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics Biden, meanwhile, has set an overarching goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Yet his own administration has chided other countries for setting impressive-sounding goals for decades in the future while doing little in the short term to actually change any behavior. Under pressure to spell out how it will achieve the intended cuts, the White House argued that it can achieve a 50 percent cut by the end of the decade by targeting the biggest-emitting sectors, including zeroing out emissions from power plants by 2035, boosting energy efficiency for homes and businesses, cutting tailpipe emissions through regulations and incentives for electric vehicles, and expanding ""carbon sinks,"" like forests and agriculture. ""We see multiple paths to reaching this goal,"" an administration official said. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris opened the climate summit Thursday, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Kerry also participating.

" They started as unexpected silver linings — clearer skies and cleaner air in cities from Los Angeles to New Delhi and a much-celebrated return of fish and crystal-clear waters to the oft-murky canals of Venice, Italy. By the end of last year, these local anecdotes were real and measurable markers of the pandemic's unintended climate benefits. Yet, while heartening, the environmental reprieve isn't expected to last. There are already signs that as countries try to return to a new normal, economic activity — and all the emissions and pollution that go along with it — will creep up again. And if the pandemic revealed what could be considered low-hanging fruit in the climate fight, it also highlighted the sheer scope of the problem. ""If you think about the scale of action that we need — if we want to limit warming as is proposed in the Paris Agreement — we would need to reduce carbon emissions by 1 or 2 billion tons every year,"" said Corinne Le Quéré, a professor of climate change science at the University of East Anglia in the U.K. ""That's less than what we did during the pandemic, but it's still a big number."" The 2020 declines were staggering. A study published last month in the journal Nature Climate Change found that global carbon dioxide emissions last year fell by 7 percent compared to 2019. And about a year ago, a paper published in the same journal estimated that in April 2020, at the height of pandemic-related lockdowns in Asia, Europe and North America, daily global carbon dioxide emissions plummeted by 17 percent compared to 2019. ""Seven percent is actually a big drop in emissions for one year,"" said Le Quéré, the lead author of both studies. ""In absolute numbers, that's 2.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide. That's never been seen before."" But there are already indications that global emissions could rebound significantly. A new report from the International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental agency based in France, projected that increasing global energy demands this year could drive emissions above pre-pandemic levels. Scientists aren't suggesting that the solutions to climate change lie in slowing down economies, paralyzing entire industries and enforcing extreme measures that disrupt people's lives. But experts say that after a year marked by profound behavioral changes, one that exposed how debilitating a global crisis can be, the pandemic offers important lessons for tackling climate change. For one, it demonstrated that countries can mobilize to tackle big problems, Le Quéré said. ""It showed that coordinated government action can deliver results rapidly,"" she said. ""The important thing now is that measures need to be good for the people, good for health, good for employment and good for the economy."" In their recent study, Le Quéré and her colleagues found that the biggest decrease in emissions last year was in the transportation sector. By the end of the year, emissions from surface transportation — which includes cars and trucks — were down by 10 percent compared to 2019 levels, and aviation was down 40 percent. As countries reopen and life returns more to normal, emissions are expected to bounce back. Yet, it's possible that at least some lifestyle changes will stick around, said Zeke Hausfather, director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute in Oakland, California. ""We're not going to stop traveling any time soon, but I think we've learned that a lot of travel is not essential,"" he said. ""Instead of flying across the country to attend a conference for one day, we can join virtually. Telepresence, remote working and a number of other things from the past year aren't just going to go away."" The adjustments could have a significant effect. Transportation accounts for nearly one-quarter of global carbon dioxide emissions, according to the International Energy Agency. In the U.S. in 2019, transportation accounted for the largest share of the country's greenhouse gas emissions, at 29 percent. Globally, air travel makes up only about 2.4 percent of carbon dioxide emissions, but before the pandemic, emissions from commercial air travel were rising. From 2013 to 2018, for instance, emissions from commercial air operations increased by 32 percent. Changing how people get around may not solve climate change on its own, but it can certainly help chip away at the emissions equation, Hausfather said. ""We're slowly moving in the right direction and making some of the worst-case outcomes less likely,"" he said. It's possible, however, to view the pandemic's climate benefits through a more pessimistic lens. While a 7 percent decline in emissions in one year is substantial in absolute terms, it only dialed back to the planet's 2011 emissions levels, Hausfather said. And the long-term effects of climate change aren't driven by year-to-year fluctuations, he said. ""The problem of global warming is one of cumulative emissions, not annual emissions,"" Hausfather said. ""It's not the 2020 emissions that determine what global temperatures are this year or last year, but all of our emissions since the Industrial Revolution."" John Reilly, co-director emeritus of the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, said the pandemic also demonstrated how challenging it can be to rely on behavioral changes as a solution. ""It was very hard to get people to mask up and socially distance,"" Reilly said. ""People don't really want to change their lifestyle or have their lives disturbed. If we have to do this with behavior changes, it'll be very difficult."" But Reilly is hopeful that the Covid-19 crisis has lent urgency to the climate fight. ""I think some people saw the pandemic and said: 'Well, this wasn't caused by climate change, but this is the sort of global disaster that may befall us with climate change, so maybe we ought to do something about it,'"" he said. There are some indications that governments are connecting the same dots, too. President Joe Biden is hosting a virtual climate summit this week with other world leaders in a bid to establish America's commitment to address climate change, days after the U.S. and China pledged to cooperate in the fight against climate change. The countries released a joint statement Sunday agreeing ""to tackle the climate crisis, which must be addressed with the seriousness and urgency that it demands."" Other countries have also signaled that they intend to take aggressive action to combat global warming. Lawmakers in the European Union are finalizing an accord that would include the goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. They are the kind of pledges experts will pay attention to this year, particularly as countries prepare to meet in November to put forth more ambitious emissions targets as part of the Paris Agreement. Biden rejoined the landmark climate accord on the first day of his presidency, and all eyes will be on the U.S. to show its commitment on the world stage. ""We definitely have a lot of lost ground to make up for, particularly in terms of our credibility,"" Hausfather said. Le Quéré said it's hard to overstate the importance of climate action as countries recover from the pandemic and rebuild their economies. And perhaps the most difficult lesson from the past year has been how interconnected the world is and thus how devastating a global crisis can be, spilling over borders and across all parts of society, often deepening existing inequalities. ""These are all systemic threats to global society,"" Le Quéré said. ""There are a lot of parallels that are very real. Governments should get the signal now that you can't ignore climate change. And if you ignore it, it's at your own peril."" Get the Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories.

" After farming for over six years, Carolina Mueller has learned how to adapt to the fickle and sometimes unpredictable weather patterns she has experienced over the last several seasons. Even this winter, when harsher frosts were expected, Mueller, 30, who works at a farm owned and run by her partner in Bastrop, Texas, about 30 miles from Austin, prepared with the rest of the farm's staff by throwing row fabric covers to protect crops from the frost, putting out extra feed for animals and stocking up on propane tanks for the greenhouse. But a deep freeze — the first in decades — caused a massive shutdown of the state's electrical grid in February, rendering propane heating and water pumps useless as Mueller and her partner were stuck in Austin for a full week because of dangerous road conditions. The couple finally returned to rows of dead crops, as well as other damage totaling over $30,000, including loss of future income. ""It was a really eye-opening experience for a lot of us who realized just how little we were prepared for these kinds of extreme weather events,"" said Mueller, who is a staff member of the National Young Farmers Coalition, a national advocacy organization, and leader of the Central Texas chapter. ""We know about heat and can sort of anticipate how to handle heat, but the freeze is a whole different thing. And considering that the last time was so long ago, a lot of young farmers had no idea what to expect."" Weather patterns are crucial in farming, as they dictate every step of the crop process. As erratic climate changes have become more the norm than the exception, young farmers across the country are feeling their effects and trying to adapt, but some say they fear the future could bring more difficulties. The Texas deep freeze has also been linked to global climate fluctuations. The U.S. Geological Survey, a science agency of the Interior Department, says ""climate change refers to the increasing changes in the measures of climate over a long period of time — including precipitation, temperature, and wind patterns."" Some of the signs are globally rising temperatures due to greenhouse gases' trapping more heat in the atmosphere and longer and more extreme droughts, the agency says. While the effects are far-reaching, farmers feel them firsthand, because agriculture and climate change are so intricately intertwined. ""Crop yield, biodiversity, and water use, as well as soil health are directly affected by a changing climate. … Continued changes in the frequency and intensity of precipitation, heat waves, and other extreme events are likely, all which will impact agricultural production,"" the Soil Science Society of America says. Forrest Watson, 30, is a fourth-generation farmer who works on his family's 2,800-acre dairy farm in Avon, New York, about 25 miles south of Rochester. Watson said he has noticed very drastic weather changes, including prolonged periods of rain and drought, which have adjusted how he farms. ""It's a daily thing that is affecting us, because obviously, we're working with the weather on a daily basis. Certainly, there were different weather events before that, but the frequency of them has increased quite dramatically in the last eight years,"" he said. ""I suspect that throughout my lifetime, it will probably become more and more difficult to rely on weather patterns and rely on a certain crop yield that we have come to expect."" Watson said that to mitigate the instability of the weather, his farm uses several practices, including cover cropping and eliminating tilling. Such measures work more naturally with the land to sequester carbon in the soil, which not only counteracts climate change but also helps improve soil health, said Watson, whose farm, Mulligan Farm, is a member of the Genesee River Demonstration Farms Network, a partnership led by American Farmland Trust, an agricultural conservation organization. Cover crops, unlike cash crops that are ultimately harvested, are planted when the ground would otherwise be bare between cash crop seasons. The crops slow erosion, improve soil health, enhance water availability and control weeds, among other benefits. While it has been around for a long time, cover cropping isn't commonly used despite its benefits, Watson said. Frank Rademacher, 26, said his family farm converted to the practice several years ago in part to counter unpredictable weather. Rademacher is a third-generation farmer in central Illinois who works on a 570-acre farm that produces non-genetically modified corn and soybeans. Rademacher said that in addition to cover cropping, he has cut fertilizer use in half, stopped using insecticide and diversified his crops for more responsible and sustainable farming, which he said will ultimately help counter climate change. But for newer farmers with less land, challenges are even more complex. Barriers to attaining farmland already exist when it comes to accessing the liquid and social capital necessary to acquire land, but with the volatility of weather, keeping a farm afloat even after getting it becomes a tense balancing act. Bari Zeiger, 25, recently bought 11½ acres of farmland under threat of residential development in Wyoming County, New York, just outside Buffalo, after six years in farming. Even as she is still starting her farm, which Zeiger said was difficult to buy, she is worried how she will handle highly unpredictable weather patterns. ""Farming is already pretty economically tenuous, and it becomes even more so with the volatility in frost dates and crop loss,"" said Zeiger, a member of the National Young Farmers Coalition. ""Because a lot of young farmers and new entry farmers, first-generation farmers, don't have access to the same acreage farmland that farmers did in the past, as farmland becomes priced out of value, you really think, 'How do I maximize or optimize my productivity on this small piece of land?'"" she said. "" So without consistent frost dates, you are unable to properly plan, which has cascading effects, because if you consider your greenhouse operation, the overhead in your greenhouse, the heat in the structure, the water in the structure, all these costs add up."" Zeiger and many other young farmers say solutions have many factors, including giving direct payments or subsidies to farmers for ecosystem services, including soil health; investing in cover cropping and other practices that promote land resiliency; and help in diversifying crops for farms. It will take a combination of incentives and regulation, Zeiger said. She said there also needs to be an emphasis on lifting up the next generation of young farmers and more diverse farmers so they can start their operations in a sustainable way. Last month, top oil and gas industry lobbying groups endorsed putting a federal price on carbon dioxide emissions, a significant shift to demonstrate seriousness in addressing climate change. President Joe Biden promised to push for a multitrillion-dollar infrastructure package with massive investments in clean energy and efficiency, but even if it is passed, the package alone might not be enough to bring greenhouse gas emissions into check. Carolina Mueller, who has begun rebuilding after the deep freeze, said that without real acknowledgment of climate change by policymakers and tangible action, farming will continue to get more difficult. Despite some movement on the issue, climate change remains highly politicized among legislators around the country. During the Trump administration, the Environmental Protection Agency actually removed climate change data from its website. ""We might be able to handle it now or in the short term, but we're barreling into a disaster, and people still have their ears plugged because they don't want to think about it,"" she said. ""I'm terrified that if we don't take action quickly and take big action on multiple levels that it will be impossible to be a farmer.""

" LONDON — Britain’s Prince William is urging the world to unite to tackle the climate crisis and channel the same “spirit of invention” that has helped in the fight against Covid-19. The Duke of Cambridge penned an open letter on Thursday alongside British broadcaster Sir David Attenborough, Queen Rania of Jordan, singer Shakira, Chinese basketball star Yao Ming, actress Cate Blanchett and a number of other high-profile figures. The letter, from William's Earthshot Prize climate initiative, says global efforts to fight Covid-19 are evidence of what is possible when the world pulls together in the face of a common threat. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics 40 world leaders were gathering virtually for a climate summit hosted by President Joe Biden on Thursday, where he will pledge that the U.S. will aim to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The summit coincides with Earth Day and the five-year anniversary of the signing of the Paris climate accord, a landmark international agreement on reducing climate-harming emissions. Despite the hardships of the pandemic, the world has learned “what it means to pull together in the face of a truly global crisis,” the letter said. “These lessons apply not just to pandemics but to the most pressing challenge in human history: stopping the climate emergency,” it added. The letter continued: ""As people around the world queue up for their vaccinations, now is the time to harness that same spirit of invention and give the Earth a shot too."" Prince William has pursued an active environmental agenda as part of his royal duties. His father, Prince Charles, has done decades of environmental work, as did his grandfather Prince Philip, who passed away earlier this month. Last year William, the second in line to the British throne, announced the £50-million ($64.54 million) Earthshot prize, a global environmental award to find solutions to the world’s biggest environmental problems over the next ten years. It’s a prize inspired by the “Moonshot speech” of President John F. Kennedy about the goal of putting a man on the moon. The first recipients of the Earthshot prize will be announced this fall. His appeal for collective climate action came as European scientists issued a stark reminder of the impacts of a warmer world, saying the continent experienced its hottest year on record. The Copernicus Climate Change Service said that the Arctic suffered a year of extremely high temperatures and lower-than-average snow cover. Arctic sea ice reached its second-lowest minimum extent since 1979, behind the record minimum of 2012, in September. The European body also said that 2020 was one of the world's three hottest years on record globally, confirming findings released this week by the World Meteorological Organization. As things stand, the combined pledges of the world’s countries fall far short of the emissions cuts scientists say are needed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels set out by the Paris accord. But experts hope Biden's summit will advance global climate progress, which has slowed down considerably after former President Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris agreement in 2017. Biden has pledged to bring the U.S. back into the international effort on climate and rejoined the Paris accord on the first day of his presidency. However, relations between the United States and China, the world's two biggest greenhouse gas emitters, remain tense over a number of non-climate issues, including trade, Hong Kong, the treatment of the Uyghur community and the future of Taiwan. In a rare sign of cooperation this weekend, the two nations committed to joining forces against climate change. Europe has also made new pledges ahead of this week's climate summit. The European Union reached a tentative climate deal to put the 27-nation bloc on a path to being “climate neutral” by 2050, with member states and parliament agreeing on binding targets for carbon emissions on Wednesday.

" This story was published in partnership with Covering Climate Now, a global journalism collaboration strengthening coverage of the climate story. The author is Covering Climate Now’s deputy director. CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — Terri Domer knows well what a brewing storm looks like.  Domer, 62, an Iowa native, has spent her life watching thunderstorms gather and tornadoes dash across rolling hills. Last August, when the midday sky darkened over the riverside homeless encampment where Domer and four other people spent most nights — built on a sandy bank near downtown, under tall trees — she quickly set about covering up their supplies.  A campmate said Domer was overreacting and left for a walk. ""Suit yourself,"" she told him. Domer was busy weighing down a tent when she heard a shout: ""I was wrong!"" She turned to spot her companion racing back to camp. The sky behind him was ""black,"" Domer said — darker than it had been just moments earlier, darker than she'd ever seen it. The derecho hit with a fury, winds whipping up sand and snapping limbs overhead. Domer rushed for cover, pulling a tent canopy over her head. Tornadoes typically come and go in minutes. But the derecho, a straight-line windstorm, was relentless. All around Domer, branches and whole trees crashed to the ground. ""I kept thinking, 'When is it going to stop?'"" Domer said. She said a prayer that she would live. It's an immutable truth of the climate crisis that the most vulnerable are hit first and hardest. At a time of rising homelessness in the U.S. and as climate-related disasters become common — wildfires in California, monster hurricanes that thrash the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico, an arctic blast in Texas — the rule holds. ""We're definitely seeing more homelessness, more housing disruption, as a result of these disasters,"" said Steve Berg, programs and policy director at the Washington-based National Alliance to End Homelessness. Climate change didn't directly cause the Midwest derecho last year or any of those other disasters. Scientists are clear, however, that a warmer planet makes extreme weather more likely and more ferocious. For people experiencing homelessness, like Domer, the storms make matters only more difficult. Others are made homeless. In both cases, government agencies and nonprofits provide support, but increasingly the needs exceed their capacity. Together, these experiences constitute a grim warning that the climate emergency is here already, draining resources and devastating lives. There are an estimated 580,000 people experiencing homelessness in America, based on a single-night count in January 2020 — the fourth straight year homelessness had increased, according to a study released last month by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It was the first year since HUD began collecting data that the number of homeless people with children had gone up. And, as usual, people of color remained starkly overrepresented compared with the U.S. population overall. Crucially, that's all pre-pandemic data, and the reality is likely to be worse than we know. Millions lost work because of Covid-19, and even as the economy recovers, there remain 8.4 million fewer jobs than before the pandemic hit. Eviction moratoriums have helped, advocates say, but as some of those expire soon, the situation could grow more dire still. The homeless population in Cedar Rapids numbers in the hundreds. It's a far cry from the tens of thousands in larger cities, like Los Angeles, but the derecho's lingering impact here is a microcosm of the various crises that can befall homeless groups in the aftermath of extreme weather. When the windstorm finally did let up, about 45 minutes after it had begun, Domer's campsite was in tatters: tents ruined, stoves and lanterns simply gone and just about everything else soiled with wet grime.  What struck Domer most, however, was the quiet. Gone were the normal afternoon sounds of the city. Even the nearby corn processing plant, a reliable source of ambient churning, was silent. ""I realized the whole town had been hit, and I thought, 'Oh, my God,'"" Domer said. The derecho swept across multiple states that day, leaving widespread and often severe damage in its wake. The Cedar Rapids area fared worst, with winds reaching 140 mph, the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane. Two-thirds of the city's famously lush tree canopy was gone, much of it displaced onto streets and homes. And the power was out. In some parts of town, it would be weeks before it returned. For the homeless, natural disasters prove torturous for more than the obvious fact that it's worse to be outside than inside during a storm. Only one-quarter of the homeless population is considered ""chronically homeless,"" meaning homeless for more than a year or experiencing repeat bouts of homelessness. At any given time, then, the vast majority of homeless people, including some who are chronically homeless, are scraping their way back toward stability. After disasters, backslide is all but inevitable. Encampments are destroyed. Resources, often hard-won, are lost. If infrastructure is damaged, a job might become more difficult or impossible to get to. Furthermore, many people who are homeless wrestle with untreated medical or mental health conditions that disasters might worsen. Domer, who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, said the derecho triggered substantial anxiety and depression, which she's still coping with. Christian Murphy, who was also on the riverbank during the storm, said he worries that Cedar Rapids' devastated tree stock will lead to lower air quality, complicating trouble he has already with breathing. After the derecho, a short distance from Domer's and Murphy's encampment, Kari Fisher surveyed the damage to the duplex where she lived with her husband and six children, ages 1 to 10.  When the storm hit, Fisher had been home-schooling, a new responsibility due to the pandemic but one she enjoyed. Structural damage to the home was clear; in the unit opposite Fisher's, a tree had smashed into the kitchen. City officials declared the home unfit for habitation, but with nowhere else to go, Fisher's family stayed. Power was shot for good, so for months they got by using plastic coolers and a propane camping stove. (Thanks to the downed trees, Fisher jokes, they also had plenty of wood.) In November, police cited the family for unlawful habitation. (Fisher is fighting the citation; she faces possible jail time, even though the family had continued to pay rent.) They were directed to Willis Dady, a homeless services nonprofit, which moved the family into a Hampton Inn & Suites north of town, using federal emergency funds made available to the city. Fisher expected they'd be there for a couple weeks. Six months later, fully eight months on from the derecho, they're stuck. In two hotel rooms, it's Fisher, her husband, an ex-husband who has a disability, seven children — Fisher gave birth to a boy in February — and two dogs. In the same Hampton Inn & Suites, there are dozens more like Fisher, and it's not the only hotel in town still housing people made homeless by the storm. ""It feels like sardines,"" Fisher said. ""It's not sustainable."" While her husband works, Fisher spends days searching Zillow, Zumper, Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace for available homes. On rental application fees alone, the family has spent $4,500 — dipping ever further into diminished savings — but nothing comes through. With so many people looking, prices are high. By the time most units are listed, they're already gone. ""We're in a hole,"" Fisher said. ""No matter how much I do, no matter how many phone calls I make, we're still here."" Her ""worst nightmare"" is that the money supporting their hotel stay will run out before the family finds new shelter. ""I'm waiting for it,"" she said. ""And when that happens, it's 'OK, what are we going to do now?' A tent at a campground? I can't raise children in a minivan."" As of mid-April, the family hoped to move into a trailer. Fisher's situation, advocates said, is characteristic. Since Hurricane Katrina in 2005 — the first major storm in the U.S. that scientists linked to climate change — disasters have been routine drivers of new homelessness. In Houston, for example, homeless rates fell year over year starting in 2012. In 2018, the year after Hurricane Harvey, they ticked back up. Last year, 11 percent of the city's unsheltered homeless population said they had become homeless because of the hurricane or another natural disaster, according to a survey by Houston's Coalition for the Homeless. The problem isn't just that homes are destroyed. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, America is short nearly 7 million affordable housing units. During an extreme weather event, affordable housing — more likely to have been built in disaster-prone areas in the first place — is especially vulnerable and often hit the hardest, shrinking the already limited inventory. Pricier homes aren't immune to destruction, of course, so families who are financially better off might also find themselves in need of short-term, lower-cost options. Demand peaks at the same time that options are depleted the most. ""Disasters of this magnitude really trickle out,"" said Ana Rausch, program operations director at the Coalition for the Homeless. After Harvey, she said, ""our regular housing of the homeless pretty much came to a halt, because we were trying to house people in the disaster shelters. And not all of those individuals were homeless."" The pattern goes like this: Disasters push people who had been housing secure toward insecurity. People who were already insecure or severely burdened by housing costs are pushed to the edge of homelessness. And, finally, people who were already homeless are pushed further back in the long wait for limited resources. The web of government agencies and nonprofits designed to help, meanwhile, is stretched to the max. In Cedar Rapids, Willis Dady typically serves 500 people in a year, including those who are actively homeless and those who are at risk of becoming homeless. Now, given the combined effects of Covid-19 and the derecho, 500 people need assistance every day, said Alicia Faust, the organization's executive director. The staff has risen to the occasion, working overtime, extending shelter hours and taking on more clients than ever, but still it's hard to keep up. To fully meet the demand, Faust said, she would need 16 full-time homelessness prevention case managers, working 30 to 35 cases apiece. Willis Dady has three. Bandwidth issues like that are a nationwide problem, said Berg, of the National Alliance to End Homelessness. And that's in part because the government responses to homelessness and disasters have both tended to treat symptoms of problems and not their root causes. ""There's always a response to the emergency,"" Berg said. ""But there isn't an overall response to people becoming homeless or the [already homeless people] impacted by this weather."" When it comes to homelessness, that is, the response is overwhelmingly oriented toward people already in crisis — not the broad economic currents that underlie homelessness, including soaring rent costs, stagnant wages and the dearth of affordable housing. As for disasters, the government mobilizes in their aftermath, but it hasn't yet taken robust, transformational action to curb climate change and foster resilience. Several recent and proposed policies could be cause for hope, however. And in some cases, solutions to homelessness and the climate crisis might be one and the same. Between coronavirus relief measures passed during the Trump administration and the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that President Joe Biden signed last month, nearly $80 billion was allocated to HUD, the Treasury Department and various federal grant recipients to fight homelessness and housing instability, a HUD spokesperson said in an email. Moreover, the White House's newly announced $3 trillion-plus infrastructure plan includes funding to build and retrofit 1 million affordable and energy-efficient housing units. ""The Administration's plan will extend affordable housing rental opportunities to underserved communities nationwide, including in rural and tribal areas,"" the HUD spokesperson said. The plan would also ""flexibly support communities in creating housing for people experiencing homelessness and the housing insecure."" Another promise of Biden's infrastructure proposal and Climate Action Plan: millions of jobs, as the administration seeks to build out America's clean energy infrastructure. Advocates for the homeless expressed cautious optimism. New affordable housing is a clear win, while the benefits of upgrading and retrofitting existing units are twofold: Just as energy efficiency is good for the planet, it lowers utility costs for renters. As for jobs, many people who experience homelessness find work in construction already. If enough training is packaged with the green jobs in Biden's plan, as the administration says it will be, those jobs could be an apt fit and a much-needed path to stability. Indeed, after the derecho, several members of the Cedar Rapids homeless community found work helping with the cleanup effort. Some continue to work in construction-related jobs as part of a Willis Dady employment initiative. Domer, as it happens, has a background in road and home construction, with a former specialty in woodwork. She is in her 60s, and both shoulders give her trouble, so those days are probably behind her — she hopes to find work soon driving a cab. But plenty of people she knows, Domer said, would jump at the opportunity. At a time when many are still struggling with the storm's repercussions, it could be a way to finally move on. ""Anything would help,"" Domer said. ""The pandemic was already tough, and then a derecho. We're still trying to figure out what normal looks like.""

" LORDSTOWN, Ohio – In the shadow of a shuttered assembly plant that once stood as a beacon of U.S. automaking, a sprint is on to finish a megafactory: this one about half a mile long, designed to build nothing but batteries for electric cars and trucks starting next year. Set to employ 1,100 workers in a space that could fit 30 football fields, the sprawling plant illustrates both hopes and challenges as the U.S. struggles to catch up in a new global race. Once the world's automotive trend-setter, the U.S. is lagging in its embrace of electric vehicles, with high costs to a lack of charging stations leading most car buyers to stick with gas guzzlers. President Joe Biden says the shift to electric is inevitable, and a rising share of automakers agree. General Motors, which shut down its iconic Lordstown assembly plant in 2019, is a joint partner in the battery megafactory being built just steps away. Even before it's complete, GM announced this month that Ultium Cells, its joint venture with LG Energy Solutions, will break ground on a second, 2.8 million-square-foot battery plant in Tennessee. ""We are entering into the generation where this huge transformation is happening. So we have no concerns about demand in the market at all,"" Kee Eun, Ultium Cells' president, said as he explained the decision to spend $2.3 billion each on the two factories. ""The key element here is economies of scale.""  Right now, electric vehicles are a paltry fraction of the cars and trucks on America's roads. Last year, the 1.8 percent of registered vehicles that were fully electric marked a record, according to data from the analytics firm IHS Markit.  Moving the needle will require a top-to-bottom rethinking of how Americans build, buy and use their vehicles, from meeting surging demand for rare earth minerals used in batteries to building out an accessible network of charging stations across the country. The challenges for transforming the U.S. into a global leader in electric vehicles are coming into focus as the Biden administration seeks to galvanize action on climate change this week during a White House global summit aimed at extracting ambitious commitments from other countries. In the U.S., the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions is tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks. Biden's infrastructure plan budgets $174 billion for electric vehicles, including tax rebates for buyers and programs to achieve his goal of installing half a million charging stations by decade's end. The money will need to address a series of challenges. As of now, it's essentially impossible to buy an electric vehicle made in the U.S. with American parts. Much of the supply chain, from the lithium-ion batteries to the brushless motors, is outside the U.S., in places like China, Japan and even Congo. ""America is in a race against economic competitors like China to own the EV market — and the supply chains for critical materials like lithium and cobalt will determine whether we win or lose,"" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said recently. American consumers regularly point to high costs for EVs, fewer options for models they like and the challenge of recharging vehicles conveniently as reasons they still prefer gas-burning combustion engines. It's the high cost of EV batteries, which can be about a third of the price of an electric vehicle, that pushes their price tags above those of traditional cars and trucks. But automakers say technological innovations, along with scaled-up production, can drive those costs down to the point where consumers soon won't have to choose between tailpipe emissions and their wallets. Automakers and political leaders are betting that those obstacles will soon crumble. ""We can't forget that the playbook has already been played,"" said Karen Felton, who oversees power and utilities consulting for Ernst & Young. ""We can look to China, we can look to the European countries and see what works and what's needed."" Biden's emphasis on building American-made cars with union labor presents another uphill battle, particularly when it comes to his goal of using the federal government's buying power – through its own fleet of hundreds of thousands of vehicles – to boost the nascent EV industry. All electric vehicles made in the U.S. are made either with nonunion labor, like Teslas, or with mostly imported parts, failing Biden's ""all-American"" test. This week the United Auto Workers implored GM to pay full union wages to workers at its joint ventures, like Ultium Cells' building EV components, calling it ""a moral obligation."" By the time the parts make it into autos available to buy at the dealership, the challenge for consumers is to find a way to recharge them that fits into their lifestyles. Auto industry analysts say the typical prospective EV purchaser has ""range anxiety"" – the fear that a vehicle will run out of battery power before there's a convenient way to recharge it. And then there's the need for public infrastructure in the form of changing stations. Orlando, Florida, has worked to install hundreds of charging stations in part to boost the use of electric vehicles in the tourism destination's massive rental car industry. Mayor Buddy Dyer says the city is also developing land use codes that will require future parking facilities to either have charging stations or be wired up with power conduits to facilitate easy installation in the future. ""It's always been one of those chicken-and-egg things: Do you have the electric vehicles, or do you have the charging infrastructure?"" Dyer said. ""I think it's pretty clear that to have an increase in electric vehicles, the government and other entities need to invest."" As older cars and trucks are phased out and increasingly replaced by electric vehicles, demands on power utilities will increase – especially as they are under pressure to generate more of that power from renewable sources like wind and solar.  That means a careful and constant rebalancing of the country's electric grid, which requires that supply and demand of electricity are kept roughly even. Vehicles charging at home draw power overnight when demand on the electricity grid is lower or even sell electricity back to the grid at times of high demand. ""This is a 20-year phenomenon. It's not like we need to do this overnight,"" said Pasquale Romano, CEO of the EV charging network ChargePoint. ""You're breaking a big problem into bite-sized pieces every year.""

" LONDON — The decline in carbon emissions that marked a slight silver lining at the start of the pandemic is set to disappear. Global carbon emissions in 2021 are projected to bounce back significantly, marking what could be the second-largest annual increase recorded, a major report said Tuesday. Emerging economies in particular are predicted to see a surge in fossil fuel usage, according to a report from the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based multinational nongovernmental organization that monitors global energy usage, raising fears that critical carbon reduction targets could be missed. The Covid-19 pandemic led to historically low carbon emissions compared to 2019 figures, as planes were grounded and cars left idle on driveways. But as the United States and Europe tentatively end pandemic restrictions, the IEA predicts an increase in global energy demand of 4.6 percent this year, 0.5 percent higher than in 2019. Such an increase would be beaten only by the surge seen after the 2008-09 financial crisis, when carbon emissions halved before rebounding strongly. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics ""This economic recovery is anything but sustainable for our climate,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Twitter. ""If governments don't act now to speed the shift from fossil fuels to clean energy, things will get worse in 2022."" Coal demand is set to rise by 60 percent or more globally, the report said, with 80 percent of this demand predicted to occur in Asia and half of it in China, although the reports notes increased demand in the U.S. Emerging economies will account for 70 percent of the year's energy demand increase, the IEA said. Global CO2 emissions are set to jump by 1.5 gigatonnes in 2021 – led by a rebound in coal demand mainly from the power sector.

It would be the 2nd largest rise in emissions ever. This economic recovery is anything but sustainable for our climate.

A return to pre-crisis levels of oil demand would push carbon emissions up a further 1.5 percent, the report said. The IAE also reported that renewable energy continues to rise, with a 3 percent increase in demand in 2020. More than half the increase in electricity supply this year will be provided by renewables, the report said, with green sources set to make up almost 30 percent of the total. While it blamed China for increases in fossil fuel usage, the IAE said the country would account for almost half the increase in renewable energy use. ""Wind and solar constitute already a notable share of global electricity production, but they are also growing more rapidly than other forms of generation, due to the decline in their costs and thus improved competitiveness,"" said Professor Tommi Ekholm of the Finnish Meteorological Institute, commenting on the report. ""The growth is primarily from China, but also from U.S., E.U. and India. However, coal use is also growing,"" he added. President Joe Biden is to hold a virtual climate summit this week at which he's expected to discuss a binding carbon emission reduction target for the U.S., which some experts have predicted could be 50 percent of current levels by 2030. The United Nations estimates that a global drop in carbon emissions of at least 45 percent from 2020 to 2030 is needed to stop global temperatures rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). The United Nations has said that restricting temperature growth to this level would prevent 420 million people being exposed to severe heat waves, as well as boost the survival of some tropical coral reefs and other wildlife.

" When the Biden administration announced in late March a $128 million initiative to improve the costs of solar power, a significant chunk of the money went to research into materials named after an obscure 19th century Russian geologist and nobleman: Lev Perovski. Among the projects listed: $40 million for research and development into so-called perovskite materials that scientists are using to push the limits of just how efficient and adaptable solar cells can be.  And while perovskites aren't anything new — they were first found in Russia’s Ural Mountains in 1839, and they are relatively common — their more recent applications in solar power technology has sparked hope that humans will use them to better harness the thousands of megawatts of energy from the sun that falls on Earth every hour. “Perovskites, I would argue, are one of the most exciting opportunities for solar cells in the immediate future,” said David Mitzi, a professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science at Duke University, who has studied the materials since the 1990s.  Any new solar power technology had to compete with silicon solar cells, an entrenched technology used for more than 50 years, Mitzi said. But perovskites had the potential to both enhance the efficiencies of silicon cells, and perhaps to compete with them directly: “I think there definitely are opportunities.” Efficiency is just one of the features. Perovskite cells can be easily manufactured into a variety of electricity-generating materials, and at much lower temperatures — and therefore potentially lower costs — than silicon cells. But the stability and durability of perovskite cells will have to be addressed before they can entirely replace silicon. Scientists have now discovered a whole class of perovskite materials that share a specific structure, incorporating three different chemicals within a cubic crystal shape. They recognized years ago that some perovskites were semiconductors, like the silicon used in electronics. But it was only in 2009 that researchers found perovskites could also be used to build solar cells, which turn sunlight into usable electricity. The first perovskite cells had very low efficiencies, so most of the sunlight that fell on them wasn’t used. But they’ve rapidly improved.  “The efficiency with which solar cells that have these perovskite materials convert sunlight to electrons has increased at a really incredible rate, to the extent that now the efficiencies are close to those of silicon solar cells in the lab,” said Lynn Loo, a professor of chemical engineering at Princeton University and the director of the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment. “That's why we are so excited about this class of materials."" Perovskite solar cells can also be made relatively easily – unlike silicon cells, which need to be refined at very high temperatures and so need a lot of energy to make. Perovskites can be made as thin sheets at low temperatures, or as inks that can effectively be “printed” onto substrates of other materials, such as flexible rolls of plastic.  That could lead to their use on surfaces where silicon solar cells wouldn’t be practical, such as the exteriors of cars or trucks; or they might even be printed onto cloth to power wearable electronics. Another possibility is to apply thin films of perovskites to the glass of windows, where they’d let through most of the light while using a part of it to generate electricity. But one of the most promising uses of perovskite cells is to combine them with silicon cells so that they use more of the sun’s energy than silicon alone. The best silicon cells are approaching their theoretical maximum efficiency of about 29 percent. But perovskite cells can be tuned to generate electricity from wavelengths of light that silicon cells don’t use – and so covering silicon solar cells with semi-transparent films of perovskite cells could overcome that fundamental limit. Physicist Henry Snaith at the University of Oxford, a leading researcher in perovskite solar cells, sees this as a way to combine the industrial dominance of silicon with the technological advantages of perovskites. He thinks “tandem” silicon and perovskite cells with efficiencies above 40 percent efficiency could be commercially widespread within 10 years, and that they could soon be followed by multilayered cells with efficiencies of over 50 percent. The potential of perovskite solar panels has also caught government attention, both here and overseas. As well as creating new commercial opportunities for U.S. companies, perovskites could become a relatively inexpensive way for solar power to challenge fossil fuels for generating electricity. “I think a lot of us have aspirations for the technology to really begin to address some of the climate change issues that need to be handled by 2050,” said physicist Joe Berry, who leads research into solar perovskites at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado. Perovskite solar cells still face problems, however, and key among these is the issue of stability. In part because they’re easy to make, perovskite cells also degrade quickly from humidity and heat. Some experimental perovskite cells have stayed stable for tens of thousands of hours, but they still have a long way to go to meet the 25 or 30 years of use of silicon cells, Snaith said. Some of the most promising perovskite materials for solar power also incorporate lead, which can be released into the environment when the perovskite cells degrade. Researchers are studying alternatives to lead-based perovskites, such as tin-based perovskites, and similar crystal structures that incorporate other, safer substances.  “I think there are some challenges ahead,” Loo said. “Whether [perovskites] are going to play a significant role depends on whether we can overcome these challenges.""

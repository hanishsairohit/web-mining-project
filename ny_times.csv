" WASHINGTON — The new infrastructure law signed by President Biden includes almost $50 billion to protect communities against climate change, the largest such investment in United States history and a recognition that the effects of warming are outpacing America’s ability to cope. Mr. Biden has insisted that at least 40 percent of the benefits of federal climate spending will reach underserved places, which tend to be low income, rural, communities of color, or some combination of the three. But historically, it is wealthier, white communities — with both high property values and the resources to apply to competitive programs — that receive the bulk of federal grants. And policy experts say it’s unclear whether, and how quickly, federal bureaucracy can level the playing field. “These tensions have to be squarely faced,” said Xavier de Souza Briggs, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who volunteered on Mr. Biden’s transition team. The White House “is trying to transform some of these deep structures of government that have needed attention for a long, long time,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT Some local governments have tried to distribute money for climate resilience in a more equitable manner. But the political backlash can be fierce. After Hurricane Harvey devastated Houston in 2017, voters approved a $2.5 billion bond to fund more than 500 flood-control projects around the county. Officials decided to prioritize those projects based in part on the “social vulnerability” of the communities they protected — an index that includes the percentage of residents who are minorities. Residents in wealthier neighborhoods, along with their elected representatives, complained the policy would push their communities to the back of the line. The new climate provisions in the infrastructure bill inject billions of dollars into competitive grant programs. These are pots of money that towns, cities and counties can access only by submitting applications, which federal agencies then rank, with funds going to applicants with the highest scores. That system is designed to ensure that funding goes to the most worthwhile projects. But it also hinges on something outside the control of the federal government: The ability of local officials to use sophisticated tools and resources to write successful applications. The result is a process that has widened the gap between rich communities and their less affluent counterparts, experts say. ADVERTISEMENT The disparity begins even before the application process begins. That’s because local governments must be aware of the grant programs in the first place, which means having dedicated staff to track those programs. Then they need to design proposals that will score highly, and correctly complete the reams of required paperwork. Even if they are awarded a grant, communities are required to pay a share of the project — often 25 percent, which is unaffordable for many struggling towns and counties. Governments that can clear those obstacles face a final hurdle: Demonstrating that the value of the property that would be protected is greater than the cost of the project. That rule often excludes communities of color and rural areas, where property values are usually lower than in white communities. “We have counties and municipalities that do not have the institutional capacity to participate in this alphabet list of programs that the federal government has created for hazard mitigation and climate adaptation,” said Jesse Keenan, a professor at Tulane University who focuses on how governments try to cope with global warming. During a virtual meeting in October, advocates challenged senior White House officials to explain how they would fulfill their promises of racial equity, given the history of federal grant programs. “It’s one thing to have an idea of how to build back better,” said Beverly Wright, founder and executive director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice. “But if the people who need it the most can’t afford it, what good is it?” ADVERTISEMENT Yoca Arditi-Rocha is executive director of the CLEO Institute, a nonprofit group in Florida that promotes climate change education, advocacy and resilience, especially for low-income communities. “The price tag to adapt to the significant climate risk our communities are facing is truly enormous,” she said. “To build back better, the federal government cannot leave behind communities like my own.” Officials conceded the challenge, and said they were looking for ways to address it, without giving specifics. “We’re very aware that this is an issue that needs work,” said Candace Vahlsing, associate director for climate at the White House Office of Management and Budget. The consequences of the current approach were on display this past summer, when the Federal Emergency Management Agency named the first round of likely winners under a new climate-resilience grant program, funding projects to address future risks from flooding, wildfires and other hazards. The Biden administration has touted the program, called Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, as a model that should be expanded. The infrastructure bill provides billions more to the program. But most of the first round winners were wealthy, predominantly white areas in a handful of coastal states, federal data show. ADVERTISEMENT More than half the money went to California, New Jersey and Washington State. The largest single recipient was a $68 million flood-control project in Menlo Park, Calif., where the median household income is more than $160,000, the typical home costs more than $2 million and only one in five residents are Black or Hispanic. The project is in line to get $50 million from FEMA. By contrast, FEMA rejected applications from places like Smithland, Ky., a town of just 240 people where the Cumberland and Ohio Rivers meet, halfway between St. Louis and Nashville. The town sought $1.4 million to build a levee along the riverbank, which has crested at flood levels three times in the past 10 years. “That’s a lot of money for us,” said Garrett Gruber, the top elected official in Livingston County, which includes Smithland. But he said the cost for the barrier, though large compared with the value of the houses it would protect, would be less expensive than erecting temporary barriers every time the river crests. “If this grant doesn’t qualify, then I’m not sure what would,” Mr. Gruber added. “It’s almost as if you would rather me just evacuate the city.” The rules that governed the first round of BRIC awards were set under the Trump administration. A senior official in the Biden administration, who spoke on condition that he not be identified by name, noted that the rules for the next round of awards have been changed, giving extra points for applications that cite benefits for disadvantaged communities. That’s part of the Biden administration’s “Justice 40” initiative, which calls for disadvantaged communities to receive the “overall benefits” of 40 percent of climate dollars, as defined and calculated by each federal agency. The initiative does not require a specific portion of climate funding be spent in underserved communities. ADVERTISEMENT Republican lawmakers who oversee federal disaster funding declined to discuss the Biden administration’s new approach. Representative Sam Graves of Missouri, the top Republican on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, declined to comment through a spokesman. A spokeswoman for Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, the top Republican on the Senate subcommittee responsible for infrastructure, didn’t respond to a request for comment. The new rules for the FEMA program define disadvantaged communities broadly, to reflect one or more of 15 suggested criteria. They include persistent poverty; racial segregation; high costs for housing, transportation, energy or water; “linguistic isolation”; job losses related to the transition away from fossil fuels; “disproportionate impacts from climate”; or even limited access to health care. And to be successful, communities must still demonstrate that their infrastructure projects would save more money than they would cost, the same criteria that makes it hard for climate resilience projects in low-income communities to get approved. One way to help small or low-income communities would be to draw from history, according to Ellory Monks, who runs a website called The Atlas, where local officials can share information. Ms. Monks has called for the federal government to recreate a version of circuit riding, in which judges traveled between small towns during the 1800s. Federal agencies would assign staff to work and live in towns or counties for a period, to help local leaders devise resilience projects and then apply for funding. “You just can’t do that from D.C.,” Ms. Monks said. If the government really wants to help disadvantaged communities become more resilient to climate change, it should move away from competitive grant programs altogether and instead decide which communities need help, then provide it directly, according to Carlos Martín, a fellow at Brookings. ADVERTISEMENT “Places that we know have high exposure to climate-related effects, and that have low wealth,” Mr. Martín said. “These are easy criteria we could set up.” Whatever approach it uses, the Biden administration must rethink who gets climate resilience money, said Ms. Arditi-Rocha of the CLEO Institute. “What is most important?” she said. “Protecting property values, or protecting the lives of people?”"
" WADING RIVER, N.Y. — If Bill Jacobs were a petty man, or a less religious one, he might look through the thicket of flowers, bushes and brambles that encircle his home and see enemies all around. For to the North, and to the South, and to the West and East and all points in between, stretch acres and acres of lawns. Lawns that are mowed and edges trimmed with military precision. Lawns where leaves are banished with roaring machines and that are oftentimes doused with pesticides. Lawns that are fastidiously manicured by landscapers like Justin Camp, Mr. Jacobs’s neighbor next door, who maintains his own pristine blanket of green. “It takes a special kind of person to do something like that,” Mr. Camp said, nodding to wooded wilds of his neighbor’s yard. “I mow lawns for a living, so it’s not my thing.” Mr. Jacobs and his wife, Lynn Jacobs, don’t have a lawn to speak of, not counting the patch of grass out back over which Mr. Jacobs runs his old manual mower every now and then. ADVERTISEMENT Their house is barely visible, obscured by a riot of flora that burst with colors — periwinkles, buttery yellows, whites, deep oranges, scarlets — from early spring through late fall. They grow assorted milkweeds, asters, elderberry, mountain mint, joe-pye weed, goldenrods, white snakeroot and ironweed. Most are native to the region, and virtually all serve the higher purpose of providing habitats and food to migrating birds and butterflies, moths, beetles, flies and bees. Mr. Jacobs is an ecologist and a Catholic who believes that humans can fight climate change and help repair the world right where they live. While a number of urban dwellers and suburbanites also sow native plants to that end, Mr. Jacobs says people need something more: To reconnect with nature and experience the sort of spiritual transcendence he feels in a forest, or on a mountain, or amid the bounty of his own yard. It’s a feeling that, for him, is akin to feeling close to God. “We need something greater than people,” said Mr. Jacobs, who worked at the Nature Conservancy for nine years before joining a nonprofit that tackles invasive species — plants, animals and pathogens that squeeze out native varieties. “We need a calling outside of ourselves, to some sort of higher power, to something higher than ourselves to preserve life on earth.” ADVERTISEMENT Which is why, for years now, Mr. Jacobs has looked beyond the lawns of Wading River, a woodsy hamlet on Long Island’s North Shore, to spread that ethos around the world. About 20 years ago, he began compiling quotes from the Bible, saints and popes that expound on the sanctity of Earth and its creatures, and posting them online. He considered naming the project after St. Francis of Assisi, the go-to saint for animals and the environment. But, not wanting to impose another European saint on American land, he instead named it after Kateri Tekakwitha, a 17th Century Algonquin-Mohawk woman who converted to Catholicism as a teenager and, in 2012, became the first Native American to be canonized. “Kateri would’ve known every plant, would’ve collected food, and would’ve been very connected with the land,” Mr. Jacobs said. Three years ago, Mr. Jacobs took a step further, teaming up with a fellow Catholic ecologist, Kathleen Hoenke, to launch the St. Kateri Habitats initiative, which encourages the creation of wildlife-friendly gardens that feature native plants and offer a place to reflect and meditate (they also teamed up to write a book, “Our Homes on Earth: A Catholic Faith and Ecology Field Guide for Children,” due out in 2023). They enlisted other ecology-minded Catholics, and have since added an Indigenous peoples program and two Indigenous women to their board. The site is apolitical, runs on donations, and proposes ways people can help mitigate the climate crisis and biodiversity collapse. “People have to love the Earth before they save it,” Mr. Jacobs said. “So love is the key. We don’t do doomsday stuff.” ADVERTISEMENT There are now about 190 St. Kateri Habitats on five continents, including an eco-village on the isle of Mauritius, a tree nursery in Cameroon, an atrium in Kailua Kona, Hawaii and a suburban backyard in Washington, D.C. The Jacobses’ yard was the first, and includes non-native plants that birds and insects love like fuchsia, a magnet for hummingbirds, and Ms. Jacobs’s steadily expanding patch of Mexican sunflowers, where, amid the petals, bumblebees often doze off in the late afternoon. Out back, autumn leaves are left in place for overwintering insects, and a years-old pile of fallen branches has become home to generations of chipmunks. Yet as the number of St. Kateri habitats grew worldwide, and their one-third acre grew more hospitable to wildlife, many of the Jacobses’ neighbors seemed to take the exact opposite tack. In nearby yards, old trees were felled by the dozens, thinning the neighborhood’s overhead canopy. Noisy machinery replaced rakes, fallen leaves became anathema, and outsourced landscaping, once the purview of the rich, became common. As concerns about tick-borne diseases grew, the popularity of pesticides soared. The Jacobses began carefully moving monarch butterfly eggs and caterpillars to special nests inside their home, to protect them from parasites and drifting chemicals. For the Jacobses, so-called all-natural or organic pesticides are suspect, too; if a substance is designed to kill one type of insect, they figure it’s bound to hurt others. Hadn’t people heard about the insect apocalypse? ADVERTISEMENT “If you’re a type of being that really has a hard time seeing things die, it’s very troubling,” Ms. Jacobs said during a chat in her garden one recent fall day, raising her voice over the din of a gasoline-powered blower that was shooing leaves from a neighbor’s lawn. Mr. Jacobs, for his part, looks around at all the pristine lawns (“the lawn is an obsession, like a cult,” he says) and sees ecological deserts that feed neither wildlife nor the human soul. “This is a poverty that most of us are not even aware of,” he said. Among the lawn-owning Wading River set, sentiments about the Jacobses’ thriving habitat ranges from admiring to indifferent to mixed. A few neighbors have whispered complaints that sometimes rats join the critter parade to the Jacobses’ yard. Mr. Jacobs said they’re drawn to birdseed — and to other neighbors’ yards too — and also that he just invested in new rodent-proof compost bins. Mr. Camp, the landscaper, maintains a friendly politesse with the Jacobses, and said that as bountiful as their garden was, lawns like his involve far less work. The other landscaper whose property abuts their yard did not respond to requests for comment. Linda Covello, who lives down the road, and who has also kept a dead tree in place because woodpeckers regularly nest there, described Ms. Jacobs as “some sort of Galadriel from Lord of the Rings.” “You’ve got your landscaping people out here,” Ms. Covello said, “But she’s the lady of the woods, the goddess of the woods.” ADVERTISEMENT Overall, though, the Jacobses had to concede that locally, their approach to nature wasn’t exactly catching on. Then a magazine marketing executive named William McCaffrey bought the house across from them in 2020, and moved in with Maxwell, his miniature pinscher. From the start, Mr. McCaffrey was entranced by the Jacobses’ garden, and took photos as he and Maxwell walked by. He and Ms. Jacobs got to chatting, and he told her that he wanted to gussy up his place, too, and grow wisteria. Ms. Jacobs gently relayed that as beautiful as wisteria was, it was invasive, smothering native plants and starving them of light. “She told me she could show me alternatives,” Mr. McCaffrey said. “I never really thought about it. She educated me.” She gave him seeds from her flowers and he planted them along with other native species. This past summer, hummingbirds, monarch butterflies and pairs of goldfinches zipped between the Jacobses’ garden and his. Now Mr. McCaffrey is planning to vastly expand his flower beds, which, per Ms. Jacobs’s counsel, he enriches using leaves from his lawn, to include 30 other kinds of native plants. He has two cars, and thinks about what else he could do in his yard to offset their carbon dioxide emissions. ADVERTISEMENT “I’m a convert,” Mr. McCaffrey said, “It really made me think about how and what I pick for my garden works into the whole cycle.” He is also noticing the land around him in new ways. One of his favorite trees on his property is a twisty, soaring locust. Gazing at it one day, Mr. McCaffrey realized he could see the shape of a woman in its graceful branches, and now he spots her every time he looks. “Can you see her?” he said, pointing up to the tree one recent day. “A ballerina.”"
" CARNAÚBA DOS DANTAS, Brazil — The land has sustained the Dantas family for more than 150 years, bearing fields of cotton, beanstalks up to a grown man’s hip and, when it rained enough, a river that led to a waterfall. But on a recent day, with temperatures approaching 100 degrees, the river had run dry, the crops would not grow and the family’s 30 remaining cattle were quickly consuming the last pool of water. “Fifty years from now, there won’t be a soul living here,” said Inácio Batista Dantas, 80, balanced in a frayed hammock. “I tell my grandchildren that things are going to get very difficult.” His granddaughter, Hellena, 16, listened in — and pushed back. She grew up here. “I plan to work this land,” she said. ADVERTISEMENT Scientists agree with her grandfather. Much of Brazil’s vast northeast is, in effect, turning into a desert — a process called desertification that is worsening across the planet. Climate change is one culprit. But local residents, faced with harsh economic realities, have also made short-term decisions to get by — like clearing trees for livestock and extracting clay for the region’s tile industry — that have carried long-term consequences. Desertification is a natural disaster playing out in slow motion in areas that are home to half a billion people, from northern China and North Africa to remote Russia and the American Southwest. The process does not generally lead to rolling sand dunes that evoke the Sahara. Instead, higher temperatures and less rain combine with deforestation and overfarming to leave the soil parched, lifeless and nearly devoid of nutrients, unable to support crops or even grass to feed livestock. ADVERTISEMENT That has made it one of the major threats to civilization’s ability to feed itself. “There is a huge body of evidence that desertification already affects food production and lowers crop yields,” said Alisher Mirzabaev, an agricultural economist at the University of Bonn in Germany, who helped write a 2019 United Nations report on the topic. “And with climate change, it’s going to get even worse.” Brazil’s northeast, the world’s most densely populated drylands, with roughly 53 million people, is among the most at risk. The region is known for droughts and poverty, inspiring novels about destitute field workers forced to abandon the land, as well as a genre of music, Baião, in which accordion-backed lyrics tell of the difficult life here. But things are becoming worse. The region had its longest drought on record from 2012 through 2017, and this year, another drought desiccated much of Brazil. In August, the United Nations’ latest major report on climate change said Brazil’s northeast faces rising temperatures, a sharp decline in groundwater, and more frequent and intense droughts. Satellite images and field tests show that 13 percent of the land has already lost its fertility, while nearly the rest of the region is at risk. “It’s reaching a tipping point,” said Humberto Barbosa, a top expert on desertification who has studied the Brazilian northeast for years. “A point of no return.” ADVERTISEMENT President Jair Bolsonaro has taken no significant measures to reverse the process. Instead, he has pulled back environmental regulations, while empowering miners and ranchers, and overseen a sharp rise in deforestation in the country. That helps feed the cycles of extreme weather. Government data released last month showed Amazon deforestation is at its worst in 15 years. Increasing deforestation in Brazil has alarmed officials around the world because it threatens the Amazon rain forest’s ability to pull carbon from the atmosphere. But it is also a primary cause of desertification, robbing the air of moisture and the soil of shade. In the Seridó region, a collection of dusty towns, family farms and industrial factories, the residents’ own impact on the land is most clearly illustrated by the rise of the ceramics industry. Atlantic Ocean Amazon R. NORTHEAST REGION Detail area, below PERU BRAZIL BOLIVIA PARAGUAY CHILE Rio de Janeiro ARGENTINA 500 MILES BRAZIL SERIDÓ Carnaúba dos Dantas Parelhas 50 MILES By The New York Times In the early 1980s, local businessmen saw an opportunity in the frequent droughts. When reservoirs and rivers evaporated, they exposed the nutrient-rich clay at the bottom, perfect for manufacturing the red roof tiles popular in much of the country. Those entrepreneurs began paying landowners for their mud, and in a few years, dozens of ceramics plants employed hundreds of people. Parelhas, population 21,000, built a metal arch over the main road into town, announcing it as the “Tile Capital.” Adelson Olivera da Costa was a pioneer of the industry, starting as a manager of one of Parelhas’s first factories in 1980 and buying it a decade later. At his small plant recently, a few dozen laborers laid out thousands of tiles to dry in the midday sun. ADVERTISEMENT “For us, the drought is good news,” Mr. da Costa said in his cramped office. He said he had 30 employees, and neighboring plants run by a son and a daughter employed dozens more. For an area long dependent on crops and livestock, ceramics were an economic jump start. But in time, the consequences became clear. Factories make the tiles by mixing water with clay, and then firing the result in a wood-burning oven. All those ingredients — water, wood and clay — are in short supply here. Mr. da Costa’s factory, one of the smaller operations in the area, uses more than 2,500 gallons of water a week, pulled from a nearby well. “People aren’t sure,” he said of the water, “but we think it will never run out.” Recent studies estimate, though, that the region’s groundwater is dwindling. The factory’s oven runs all night, Monday to Friday. Just before 5 a.m. one weekday, two men pulled branches and trunks from large piles and stuffed them into six fireplaces that heated an oven the size of a house. The operation consumes 60 to 75 cubic meters of wood a week, or enough to fill five large dump trucks. ADVERTISEMENT Then there is the tiles’ main ingredient, clay. Years ago, Mr. da Costa said he bought clay from the dried-up lake beds within a few miles of his operation. With those now depleted, he is hauling in mud from hours away. Aldrin Perez, a Brazilian government scientist who tracks desertification, said it takes 300 years to deposit one centimeter of soil, while ceramics companies take three to five feet of soil each time they extract clay. “In seconds, they destroy meters of depth that were formed over millions of years,” he said. That can have a devastating effect. The soil and clay they extract is crucial for retaining a proper balance of nutrients and moisture in the surrounding land. “It kills the area,” said Damião Santos Ferreira, the manager of Mr. da Costa’s factory, explaining why some people were hesitant to sell their clay. “It’s never the same.” The factory pays landowners about $10 for 30 tons of clay, he said. By now, most landowners know the consequences. Yet plenty still get desperate enough to sell. One of them was Mr. Dantas. In 2010, during another difficult dry season, Mr. Dantas said his family almost ran out of money. To feed themselves and their cattle, they decided to cash in on their mud. ADVERTISEMENT “Everyone agreed,” Mr. Dantas said. “It was necessary,” his son, Paulo, said. The clay came from a reservoir Mr. Dantas’s great-grandfather built in the 19th century to supply water for their 506-acre land. When it evaporated each dry season, the family had planted beans, corn and cotton in the fertile bed left behind. It was one of their most productive plots of land. But in 2010, instead of planting, the family watched four men with shovels excavate and haul away the soil. It took them three months. They paid about $3,500 for the clay. The money helped the family survive through the yearslong drought that followed. But the land around the reservoir was left nearly barren. Paulo Dantas planted corn, beans and watermelon several years later, but the produce was so pitiful, they fed it to the cattle. Then, last year, it rained much more than usual. The reservoir filled to about six feet. Hellena, Mr. Dantas’s granddaughter, swam in it. When it dried up, the family planted seeds. Grass for the cattle grew, but the beans and corn wilted. “I really regret it,” Mr. Dantas said of selling the clay. “I saw it wasn’t good. But the children needed it.” Standing on the reservoir’s embankment, he looked over the parched land as the sun set. “I had no choice,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT"
" Royal Dutch Shell said Thursday that it had decided not to invest in a British oil development off the coast of Scotland that has become a test of the government’s environmental credentials. The field, known as Cambo, is in deep water northwest of the Shetland Islands. It is seen as a bellwether for the future of Britain’s declining but still large North Sea oil industry. The British government is considering whether to approve the project, which environmental groups and some politicians have said should be rejected because it would produce carbon dioxide emissions responsible for climate change. Shell, which owns 30 percent of Cambo, said it had “concluded the economic case for investment in this project is not strong enough at this time.” ADVERTISEMENT The company also said there was “potential for delays,” apparently referring to the possibility that the drilling would draw protests from environmental groups and possibly legal actions trying to stop it. Shell said recently that it planned to move its headquarters from the Netherlands to Britain. Shell’s decision to decline to invest in developing Cambo is a serious blow to the project. Siccar Point Energy, a private equity-backed firm that is Cambo’s main owner and developer, said that while “disappointed” by Shell’s decision, it remained “confident about the qualities” of the project, saying it would create 1,000 jobs. Siccar Point has said that it plans to invest $2.6 billion in Cambo and that it has already spent $190 million in the four years since it acquired the rights to the field, which was discovered in 2002. The oil industry argues that as long as Britain consumes more oil and natural gas than it produces, it is preferable for those fuels to come from the North Sea, where emissions regulations can be set, instead of from places with potentially fewer controls. The environmental group Greenpeace UK said letting Cambo go ahead “would be a disaster for our climate and would leave the U.K. consumer vulnerable to volatile fossil fuel markets.”"
" Brynn Kimber, a research scientist at the University of Washington who works in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Marine Mammal Laboratory, has spent a lot of time analyzing audio data recorded in the icy waters north of Alaska, Canada and Russia. Typically, Ms. Kimber hears the chatter of bowhead whales, belugas, narwhals and other cetaceans native to that part of the Arctic. A few years ago, they started hearing a distinctive cry acousticians describe as similar to that of a disgruntled house cat: The piercing call of a killer whale. Ms. Kimber wondered at first if their ears were deceiving them. “When I started the job my mentor told me, ‘You won’t see killer whales this far north,’” Ms. Kimber said. But as years of data accumulated, along with more orca calls in areas where they’d never been recorded, it appeared that was no longer true. “Where I would see absolutely none in previous years, in later years I was seeing more and more,” Ms. Kimber said. “That was pretty unusual.” ADVERTISEMENT The orca calls are further evidence of a rapidly changing Arctic. As sea ice has receded, killer whales — which are actually dolphins — are now venturing to parts of the sea that were once inaccessible, and spending more time in places they were once seen only sporadically, according to data Ms. Kimber presented Thursday at the annual meeting of the Acoustical Society of America in Seattle. As a result, some of nature’s most effective predators have vastly broadened the scope of their hunt. The change has potentially significant consequences for animals up and down the food chain — including humans. Arctic sea ice has declined significantly in the four decades since satellite monitoring began. Roughly 75 percent of ice volume disappeared in the last 15 years alone, and the remaining ice is thinner and of poorer quality, said Amy Willoughby, a marine mammal biologist with NOAA’s Alaska Fisheries Science Center. The loss of ice coupled with warming waters and atmospheric temperatures has affected every level of the Arctic ecosystem. Large mammals like polar bears have struggled to navigate shrinking habitats, while the marine algae at the base of the Arctic food chain blooms sooner and more abundantly than ever before. ADVERTISEMENT In recent years, scientists have noticed similar upheaval in the behavior of the region’s marine mammals. Orca are feasting more often on bowhead whales. Scientists and Indigenous Arctic communities have noted a growing number of bowhead whale carcasses in the northeastern Chukchi and western Beaufort seas with signs of orca attack. Even if the orca don’t take a single bite, the predators’ mere presence can have far-reaching consequences. Bowhead whales typically retreat into protective patches of dense ice when threatened by orcas, which lack the giant-skulled bowheads’ ability to break through frozen waters for air. An Inuit word, “aarlirijuk,” describes this bowhead fear response evolved specifically to evade killer whales. But as the ice recedes, these defense mechanisms can prove a liability. Bowheads must spend more time than ever before hiding in thick ice where feeding opportunities are scarce. Calves that aren’t yet strong enough to crack through the ice can suffocate. Any decline in bowhead numbers could have consequences up the food chain too: The baleen whales are a significant food source for subsistence hunters in Indigenous Arctic communities, Ms. Kimber said. “Killer whales are really intelligent,” said Cory Matthews, a research scientist with the Arctic region of Fisheries and Oceans Canada. “They consume really fast. If a new area opens up, they can get in there maybe within the next year and exploit a prey population that could be perhaps really slow to respond to those changes.” It could take years, he added, before scientists fully understand the long-term consequences of how these extremely lethal and newly emboldened hunters are expanding their reach in the Arctic."
" This personal reflection is part of a series called Turning Points, in which writers explore what critical moments from this year might mean for the year ahead. You can read more by visiting the Turning Points series page. Turning Point: The United Nations called a report on climate change released in August “code red for humanity.” The climate crisis has been building for decades, but only since the mid-2000s has it truly come to the attention of the richer countries that comprise the Global North. Wildfires from California to Greece and flash floods from New York City to Germany have opened people’s eyes to the fact that this global crisis is real — and it is in danger of spinning out of our control if something isn’t done to stop it. This past summer, the world’s climate scientists published the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, highlighting, once again, the need to act now. But rather than finding conviction in the many public reactions to these dire warnings, I instead sense a feeling of helplessness. Many in the Global North seem unable — or unwilling — to connect our growth-based, consumption-driven economy with the intensifying natural disasters around us. ADVERTISEMENT We live in countries that burned through their share of the world’s CO2 budget long ago — if we account for the historic emissions released since 1850. But the effects of that overspending have mostly ravaged the faraway countries that we don’t see, whose citizens face far greater risks to their personal safety when they speak out against this injustice. I believe that those of us who can act have a responsibility to do so. Embracing activism to combat polluters — who hurt the whole world — is a way to begin to repay our debt. Indeed, that ability to organize and protest safely is, to me, one of the most powerful symptoms of our privilege. And in my experience, exercising that privilege is the most effective way to help move the entire world toward a safer, more just future for all life on this planet. My first encounter with the frustration and helplessness many of us face came a decade ago. I had graduated from maritime college and received my commercial navigation license, and in August 2011, I brought the German research icebreaker RV Polarstern to the North Pole. Our scientists cheered and toasted the journey on the frozen deck. But within a few minutes, everyone was back to work, and I saw concerned faces. We couldn’t carry out the ice measurements we had come to take directly at the North Pole, because there was simply not enough old ice. In the end, we had to search for a sizable old ice floe using a helicopter. Frustration reigned among the older scientists, whose decades of reports and warnings about the climate crisis had mostly been ignored. Today, most people call me an activist. I no longer work as a maritime professional, although people know me publicly as the captain of a refugee rescue vessel who was arrested (and immediately released) after docking in Italy without permission after a 17-day standoff. It was an act of civil disobedience, using my white middle-class privilege (my ability to study for free at university and my confidence in a lower likelihood of being prosecuted for smuggling, in contrast to many migrants in Greece or Italy) to support people violently pushed to the margins by European society. ADVERTISEMENT In August 2021, I returned to Germany, to the remains of a village called Lützerath, just 200 meters away from the vast open lignite mine called Garzweiler that powers the energy company RWE’s coal power station Neurath — one of the 10 biggest polluters in Europe. A single farm is all that’s left. The farmer doesn’t want to sell his land to RWE and may soon be evicted. I am among the nearly 300 people he invited to oppose the action by occupying the land with a permanent camp. In places like Lützerath, I see another chance to protest and use direct action and land occupations to prevent further coal mining, which will ultimately contribute to rising fossil fuel emissions and, if left unchecked, a global climate catastrophe. Polluting industries won’t abandon their destructive business models without public confrontation. Unlike the people who live thousands of miles away — and whose lives have been disproportionately affected by climate change for far longer than those of us in the Global North — I and many others have been born, or now live, in places where some of the world’s biggest polluters, including Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Chevron and Total, are headquartered. This privilege of location, combined with our responsibility for our historic carbon debt, means a variety of tactics, including acts of civil disobedience, can be used on the home turfs of corporations that pollute, to hold them accountable for their crimes. That privilege also provides direct access to the power structures of those corporations: their finances, their lobby power and their social license to operate. This won’t be easy. After all, many people, past and present, have struggled for their rights and freedoms in far more difficult circumstances. Abdul Aziz Muhamat, a friend from Sudan, spent years in Australia’s offshore immigration detention centers on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. During that time, the detainees tirelessly organized and confronted the Australian government over its policy of holding asylum seekers there. Eventually, most of them were released. A friend from Kenya, Phyllis Omido, and her community in a slum of Mombasa took up the fight against lead poisoning by a local factory. She was attacked, arrested and even had to hide after her lawsuit against the government brought more threats against her. In the end, she and her community prevailed, and several toxic waste smelters were shut down. Speaking out for one’s rights can be a death sentence in many countries. Traditionally democratic nations appear to be heading down a similar path by criminalizing items and activities associated with protesting and civil disobedience. Following the 2016 protests over the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, many U.S. states passed laws to criminalize trespassing around oil and gas pipelines. In response to protests against coal mining, Australia passed a law in 2020 criminalizing the lock-on devices activists use to attach themselves to each other, rail tracks or other objects. And over the past summer, police officers in Germany arrested other activists in Lützerath under changes in 2018 to a security law known as “Lex Hambi” in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The law, which allows the police to detain people for up to seven days in order to verify their identity, was made in part as a response to climate activists who had obscured their fingerprints to avoid identification. This may be the first time that some people are feeling such a lack of control over their personal, and our collective, future. Many, particularly those of us in the white middle class, are not used to fighting uphill battles against unequal power structures. Many of us have not been taught how to build community and collective power in a situation where the odds are stacked against us. In other words, our privilege is being tested. Luckily, that privilege can also give us the means and determination to rise to that challenge. I am not looking forward to confronting the police and RWE’s security in Lützerath. In truth, I would prefer to go back to my old life and sail around Antarctica in a science support role. But I know that my privilege gives me responsibilities not only to communities struggling for their survival, but also to the global community of all living beings. The fight for global climate safety is now at our doorstep. To succeed, it will need a culture of resistance and a clear vision of justice and solidarity.

The day after the storm swallowed her neighborhood, Nancy Ortiz woke before dawn to buy ice. It was 2012, and Hurricane Sandy had reclaimed Lower Manhattan for Mother Nature. Making landfall near Atlantic City, it swept north, ravaging the New Jersey coast, destroying thousands of homes and inundating New York City with waves as high as 14 feet. Sandy shuttered Wall Street, rattling global markets, and for a moment the storm restored Manhattan’s early 17th-century coastline. A brackish murk of waist-high water submerged all the landfill that humans had dredged, salvaged and shipped to widen the island, and that now supported the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive. It also swamped a large cluster of public housing developments and a beloved but bedraggled ribbon of greenery built by Robert Moses during the 1930s called East River Park. In the dark, Ms. Ortiz tiptoed through a shambles of overturned cars and shattered glass to her Acura TSX. The storm had knocked out electricity to 250,000 people in the area, including those in Vladeck Houses, the oldest public housing project on the Lower East Side. As president of the Vladeck tenants’ association, Ms. Ortiz knew there were many diabetic residents who would need to keep their insulin cold. She figured help wasn’t likely to come quickly; for public housing residents, it rarely did. So she got into her car and headed north, some 15 miles, all the way into the Bronx, before finding a store selling 10-pound bags of ice. Into the night she navigated Vladeck’s dark stairwells, knocking on doors. ADVERTISEMENT Though Ms. Ortiz’s neighborhood was one of the worst hit by Sandy, the storm caused tens of billions of dollars in damage all across the region and killed more than 100 people. It was a sign of things to come and begged for a federal response. After surveying the wreckage, President Barack Obama turned to Shaun Donovan, his secretary of housing and urban development, who came up with a novel federal competition called Rebuild by Design. Teams of architects and engineers were invited to conceive creative flood-protection proposals in collaboration with members of the affected communities. Several dozen proposals surfaced, and in 2014, seven winners were selected. By far the largest grant went to a segment of a wider Lower Manhattan resiliency plan called the BIG U. It aimed to protect residents in the public housing developments, including Vladeck. Officials named the segment the East Side Coastal Resiliency project. ADVERTISEMENT Borrowing ideas from the waterlogged Dutch, the plan imagined a redesigned East River Park that could withstand flooding from future Sandy-level events. A grassy, reinforced hill, or berm, on the western edge of the park abutting the F.D.R. Drive would be built to act as a barrier, holding back floodwaters and protecting the housing developments. The plan went through years of public workshops, town hall meetings and open houses attended by more than 1,000 community members. Its estimated price tag was $760 million. New York City taxpayers would pay for what the federal government’s grant didn’t cover. I had followed Rebuild from the start. As an architecture critic focused on public space, housing and the environment, I saw the effort as a genuine breakthrough. The political stars looked as if they might align — federal, state and city governments, as well as neighborhood groups all pulling in unison to tackle climate change on a meaningful scale in ways that prioritized design and the needs of vulnerable populations. Rebuild, in spirit at least, harked back to the creative, can-do days of the New Deal and the space program. I visited sites with Mr. Donovan, sat in on meetings and invited the plan’s architects to graduate classes I taught on climate change and global cities at Columbia University. The architects told the students about the slow, incremental process of earning neighborhood support. They came with glossy renderings of photoshopped joggers and parents pushing strollers in the reimagined park where floods came and went. But then, in 2018, under Mayor Bill de Blasio, the mood changed. Behind closed doors, city agencies did a “constructability review” — that is, they calculated the proposal’s costs and timeline — and concluded that it was simply not feasible. The city’s parks department said it didn’t have the money, workers or expertise to maintain infrastructure in a park built to flood. The department of transportation, prioritizing cars and trucks, decided the berm’s construction would be too disruptive to traffic on the F.D.R. Drive. Con Edison said that the proposal would interfere with its underground power lines and that engineering the necessary tunnels to encase the lines could add years, risks and untold costs to the project. City Hall unveiled what it called an alternative design. It would cost New Yorkers $1.45 billion. It required razing not a portion of the park, like the earlier plan, but the entire park, and then covering nearly all its 50-odd acres with eight to 10 feet of landfill while keeping Con Ed’s power lines accessible. A new East River Park much like the one envisioned by the architects and community groups would be built on top of the landfill, with new areas for passive recreation. Gone was the idea of periodic, acceptable flooding. The new raised park, braced by a 1.2-mile flood wall and millions of tons of layered earth barged in by water, would act as a levee to hold back the surging sea. Daniel Arnold for The New York Times When the mayor announced the plan, I started to hear new voices. A group led by professors, artists and other Lower Manhattan residents, a number of whom didn’t live next to the park but used it, started organizing protests. They argued that the city’s new plan did not go far enough to address the effects of climate change and that demolishing the park with the shade of a thousand mature trees would leave the neighborhood without precious green space for years. They contested the city’s experts who said the park couldn’t be maintained as a gigantic sponge. I saw pictures of them chaining themselves to trees and noticed they enlisted a lawyer who had opposed other city initiatives, including rapid bus lanes on 14th Street. Ms. Ortiz and some of her neighbors in the subsidized housing projects were no less appalled by the mayor’s sudden change of plans. “We felt betrayed, like we didn’t exist,” was how Ms. Ortiz put it to me. But they also wanted something, anything, built as soon as possible, to protect them from the flooding of future Sandys. They started to accept the merits of the city’s plan. As they did so, they began to see its opponents as interlopers — more than a few of them wealthier, white people living in apartments that were not on the front lines. A project devised to build community trust and overcome political gridlock seemed to be fracturing the community instead. ADVERTISEMENT Now, nearly a decade after Sandy, the Lower East Side is still vulnerable. Across the country, there are similar daunting challenges that demand big, robust and swift responses. There’s climate change, of course, which brings extreme weather and rising seas, but also a dearth of affordable housing, an electric grid in disrepair, a lack of broadband access, failing public transit systems — the list goes on and on. The recent passage of a $1.2 trillion federal infrastructure bill is a big step toward tackling some of those problems, but as East River Park shows, even when money is at hand, our convoluted systems often make it difficult or impossible to find consensus and work at the speed and scale required. A process of participatory planning, rightly evolved to represent interests other than government technocrats and wealthy developers, has also created, in some places, a culture of Nimby-ism that thwarts even modest proposals. Our conversations seem increasingly cramped, mean and small. Is our society just too frayed to come together around basic material needs? In the debate over what is officially called John V. Lindsay East River Park, I sensed there might be some useful lessons about how we got here and how we might try to think differently. The park saga is not a conflict between bad versus good actors, but a confluence of different interests, different areas of expertise, different notions of community. It is a parable of progress. Construction on enormous flood walls north of the park has begun. The city had planned to start reconstruction in the park itself by late November, until a judge granted opponents a temporary stay. The stay has just been lifted, and park construction is supposed to take five years. Daniel Arnold for The New York Times If completed, the new park certainly won’t be the best thing that we could achieve, far from it, and it may need to be rebuilt to cope with even more extreme weather in the future. But nor is it a certain calamity. It’s a hefty public investment to benefit thousands of underserved New Yorkers that should provide some protection from flooding for a time — an incremental step, in other words. Incrementalism is how we think about progress today. The question is: Are there other ways to think about it? In 1939, George Gallup’s American Institute of Public Opinion conducted a national poll. With the country coming out of the Depression, pollsters asked Americans to name both the Roosevelt administration’s greatest accomplishment and lowest point. The New Deal had by then established Social Security and federal bank deposit insurance, but what became known as the Work Projects Administration was arguably its most ambitious program. A vast menu of public works, coordinated with local and state authorities, the W.P.A. employed millions of Americans. Across the nation, it produced new schools, hospitals, sewers and hydroelectric power plants, as well as murals, sculptures, libraries, LaGuardia Airport in Queens and some 650,000 miles of roads and 8,000 parks. It transformed America. As the historian Jason Scott Smith tells it, in the Gallup survey the W.P.A. was ranked as both the best and worst thing the administration had done. Change, big change especially, always profits some and troubles others. ADVERTISEMENT Among the roads funded by the W.P.A. was a section of the F.D.R. Drive, then called East River Drive. To city leaders nearly a century ago, New York’s economic future hinged on suburban commuters and automobiles. Car dependence now seems spectacularly wrongheaded to urban planners, ecologists and transit advocates, with all we know about sprawl, carbon emissions and the way highways divided and segregated city neighborhoods. But what is regarded as progress at one moment often comes to be seen as the problem later. As Eric Klinenberg, a sociology professor at New York University, puts it, “Science is based on the premise that we will inevitably be wrong and find better ways to make sense of things.” Social reformers in the 1930s seized on the highway’s construction to lobby for the creation of new forms of public housing next to the new East River Drive. Vladeck Houses, the first of these developments, opened in 1940: a complex of 20 six-story brick apartment blocks featuring modern conveniences like “self-operating elevators,” as one news report noted. In contrast to the cramped, airless tenements that made the turn-of-the-century Lower East Side notorious for overcrowding and outbreaks of cholera and other diseases, Vladeck’s boxy buildings in wide open spaces represented progressive ideals about humane living and public health. More than 19,000 New Yorkers applied for 1,771 subsidized apartments before officials had to put a halt to applications. Robert Moses, then New York’s parks commissioner, saw another opportunity in the highway’s construction. The East River, down to the Battery, had once formed the heart of one of the mightiest and most prosperous ports in the world. By the 1930s, however, maritime traffic had shifted across town, to the deeper channels of the Hudson River. In 1937, Moses persuaded city officials to add acres of landfill along the East River waterfront, expanding Manhattan’s shoreline and creating a slender, gracious park with wading pools, baseball fields, shuffleboard courts, an open-air dance floor and an amphitheater, where among other things, Shakespeare in the Park would make its debut. Shaded by London planes and pin oak trees, the park was sandwiched between the new highway and a riverside promenade. One of Moses’s less-heralded triumphs, East River Park opened in 1939. Three years later, Nancy Ortiz’s recently widowed grandmother left Puerto Rico and settled into a tenement on Delancey Street in the heart of the Lower East Side with her seven children. The youngest, Nancy’s future father, was 12-year-old Diego, who was called Willie, though no one can recall why. East River Park, a couple of blocks away, became Willie’s backyard. Years later, after returning from the Korean War, Willie moved a little closer to the park into a development called Lavanburg Homes. Nancy grew up there. As a little girl, Ms. Ortiz recalls, she would accompany her father to the park on summer weekends. Willie and other men from the neighborhood would play softball in guayaberas and dress shoes while she played tag with her friends. Kids who skipped school, she remembers, would hide from truant officers behind the amphitheater. For Moses, the 1940s and ’50s were years of peak authority as the city’s planning czar. Among other things, he oversaw the addition of more public housing developments along the East River. But the 1960s brought new thinking. Rachel Carson, the marine biologist and author, challenged the authority of pesticide-making chemical companies and inspired the environmental movement. Jane Jacobs took on the urban planning establishment. The highways Moses built had demolished and physically split neighborhoods, displacing or isolating thousands of Black and brown residents and fouling the air with car exhaust. Jacobs argued that ordinary residents who saw the city from the sidewalk level — not planners like Moses looking down on maps like demigods, or developers, focused on profits — knew best what ought to be saved or built in their own neighborhoods. Community members were the true experts. Moses’s power waned. ADVERTISEMENT By the early 1970s, when Ms. Ortiz and her parents moved from Lavanburg into one of the newer Moses developments on Delancey Street, an idea called Westway started to take shape across town. The West Side piers, which had replaced those on the East River, had by then become obsolete, too, and Westway was a plan to reimagine that waterfront. A new interstate would be tunneled below the Hudson River, removing cars and trucks from city streets. Disused warehouses and docks would make way for apartments and commercial development. As with East River Park, acres of landfill would be added to create a vast green esplanade. Over the next decade and a half, Westway secured endorsements from New York’s governors and mayors. And President Ronald Reagan’s administration agreed to pay to move the highway. But it wasn’t to be. The culture had shifted. As more Black and Hispanic tenants moved into public housing, federal and local authorities lost interest in its upkeep. Developments like Vladeck, once advertised as bucolic and equitable alternatives to dense city living, came to represent urban decline. With Westway, newly energized urban activists seized on the proposal as an outmoded emblem of Moses-style, top-down arrogance (though it wasn’t Moses’s idea). They said it prioritized drivers, not public transit users; developers, not blue-collar New Yorkers. Environmentalists focused on its potential to disrupt the mating patterns of striped bass in the Hudson River. A coalition of wildlife advocates, architectural preservationists and subway riders, capitalizing on new, Nixon-era ecological regulations, challenged government experts in court. And they won. Whether, in retrospect, Westway’s defeat was a victory for the city or not—in effect, environmentalists derailed what would have been a greenway roughly twice the size of East River Park—it was definitely a triumph for grass-roots organizers, signaling a new era in participatory democracy. The Powers That Be had begun to yield, however reluctantly and performatively, to People Power. When Rebuild for Design endorsed the East Side Coastal Resiliency project, the big idea was that it would be radically inclusive. The flood-proofing of East River Park would do more than protect the neighborhood from storm surges, its organizers said. It would marry elite architecture and urban planning with meaningful public engagement. People power would join up with expertise. In 2013, Lower East Siders began to meet with representatives from One Architecture & Urbanism and the Bjarke Ingels Group, better known as BIG, the high-profile Danish architecture firm. This group had come up with the multipart plan, called the BIG U, for protecting all of Lower Manhattan. Jeremy Siegel, one of BIG’s architects, remembers lugging models and maps to community centers and public schools to show residents what the park could look like. He enjoyed the back and forth, he told me, and described the rounds of meetings as “a slow, iterative process.” Matthijs Bouw, the Dutch founder of One Architecture and a co-leader of the BIG Team, recalls that community members at first expressed fear about displacement, along with a good dose of distrust. For him, a key moment was when a local organizer who had been skeptical of the plan stood up and said that “this was the first time residents were treated like partners.” ADVERTISEMENT Ms. Ortiz, who became a co-chair of a community board task force, recalls seniors lobbying for benches and tables where they could play cards and families petitioning for outdoor movie screenings. “People from the neighborhood wanted to see themselves in the process,” she told me. “Over time, we felt we were being heard.” That is the goal of participatory decision-making, after all. To borrow a phrase from Malcolm Araos, a graduate student at New York University who is writing his dissertation about the park, public trust requires participants to “continuously recognize their inputs reflected in the evolution” of a project. So when Mayor de Blasio’s administration, which had not raised insuperable objections during nearly five years of community consultation, suddenly swapped the plan for what officials decided was a more technically sound one, the switch did more than infuriate residents. It caused a legitimacy crisis. Residents felt bamboozled. The whole consulting process suddenly seemed like a sham. And if that were the case, opponents asked, why should anyone believe city officials who said the engineering, construction and maintenance costs made the earlier plan impossible? Expertise itself was now up for debate. “We understand the frustration,” said Jamie Torres-Springer, who was first deputy commissioner of the city’s Department of Design and Construction when the new plan was announced. In retrospect, he told me, it would have been better to explain more clearly the city’s perspective to residents in community meetings before announcing it as a done deal. But “we were facing a deadline to spend the federal funds and wanted to get the project built as quickly as possible to get the flood protection in place,” he added. “We really didn’t consider the new design to be a radical change from the original one.” Except, of course, that a central goal of the whole process, to build trust, had been undermined. I met recently with a half-dozen members of East River Park Action, the most vociferous of the opposition groups that arose in response to the new plan. Months earlier, the group’s alerts started dropping in my inbox, announcing a court hearing or inviting people to join a protest march. We gathered around a table at Cafe Mogador, an old Middle Eastern standby in the East Village. The group included Pat Arnow, a photographer; Billie Cohen, a landscape designer; and Eileen Myles, a poet and the author of “Chelsea Girls.” Their distrust of the Mayor’s plan has been exacerbated by the city’s refusal to turn over documents about its constructability study. “We had to do a Freedom of Information Law request and the city finally released a heavily redacted version of the study,” Ms. Arnow said. “Why should we believe anything the city says if it keeps hiding the truth?” Ms. Arnow’s group supported the original berm idea that had been developed with the community, and imagined the East River waterfront gradually transforming into wetlands. As sea levels rise, Ms. Arnow foresaw East River Park evolving into eco-friendly marshes managed by the parks department. The group suggested that a truly enlightened response to climate change would be to build a green roof over the F.D.R. Drive — an idea the BIG Team had floated at the very start, before city officials asked that it be withdrawn because, as Amy Chester, the managing director of Rebuild recalls, City Hall didn’t want to “overpromise.” A roof, according to the East River Park Action group, would create a protective barrier for the housing developments while also muffling traffic noise and providing additional parkland. In essence, they said, bury the highway, not the park. “It’s not a comprehensive plan,” is how Ms. Cohen summed up criticism of the city’s proposal. It made no sense, the group argued, to cut down mature trees that provide shade, hold carbon and act as a stopover for migratory birds, and replace them with saplings. Instead, they urged, focus on increasing the city’s sewer capacity, upgrading public housing campuses and reducing car emissions. ADVERTISEMENT Daniel Arnold for The New York Times I found it hard to argue in principle with their desires. I also love the existing park, a shambolic retreat and slice of midcentury New York, which had some recent, costly upgrades, like a riverfront esplanade, that will now need to be undone. It’s painful to imagine demolishing all those flower gardens, W.P.A.-era buildings and playing fields. New York’s drainage and sewer systems are indeed rickety and ancient, a fact driven home in September when a downpour from Tropical Storm Ida flooded city streets and killed dozens of people in the region. But constructing thousands of miles of new sewers — not to mention rerouting highways and other herculean, long-term measures — was never Rebuild’s remit. And at a certain point, making such lofty goals a prerequisite for urgently needed flood protection only ensures that nothing will get done. After meeting with Ms. Arnow and the other East River Park Action representatives, I visited Ms. Ortiz. She has become a frequently cited supporter of the city’s plan. In January, after stepping down as Vladeck’s tenant president, she started working as a special assistant at the New York City Housing Authority, or NYCHA. We arranged a post-work late lunch at El Castillo de Jagua 2, a Dominican restaurant near Vladeck Houses, where she kissed the waitress and waved to customers. Frank Avila-Goldman, a leader of the residents’ committee at Gouverneur Gardens, a development next to Vladeck, joined us. Unlike Vladeck, which sits on higher ground, Gouverneur Gardens was badly flooded during Sandy. When she first heard on the TV news that the city had discarded the original plan, Ms. Ortiz said, she was every bit as angry as Ms. Arnow and the other East River Park Action members. The city scrambled to make up for its botched rollout by holding meetings with NYCHA. Carlina Rivera, a City Council member representing the district, helped organize some of these meetings and noticed a gradual thaw among public housing residents. “They were upset by how the new plan had been announced,” Ms. Rivera said, “but at the end of the day they wanted protection and wanted to know there would be a park for their grandchildren.” The obstacle to that aim, some of those NYCHA tenants came to believe, were now the members of East River Park Action and other such groups. Over the last several years, among the hundreds of thousands of residents in the area, a few thousand people signed petitions against the city’s plan. What percentage of the roughly 30,000 public housing residents objected to it isn’t clear. But people like Ms. Ortiz and Mr. Avila-Goldman began to zero in on how many of the most outspoken opponents seemed to them to be white people not living in subsidized housing. “For tenants in my building and the people I know in NYCHA who were slammed by Sandy, we need flood protection yesterday,” Mr. Avila-Goldman told me. “The opponents who came late to the party talk about saving trees and squirrels. I have been to so many meetings where I felt talked down to, as if only white people are the ones who care about the environment. If I had a magic wand, I would also deck over the F.D.R. Drive because when I open my windows I find soot on my walls from all the traffic. I’m on the front line. But covering the highway is a pipe dream these people are using to derail a plan that is about saving our lives and our park.” As Ms. Ortiz put it: “The new plan didn’t blow up the community. It revealed that there isn’t a community. People like to throw around that word.” ADVERTISEMENT It’s not coincidental that the rise of community activism and the use of the word “expertise” occurred around the same time. “Expertise started to be commonly used only during the 1960s and ’70s precisely because there were suddenly conflicts over who should call themselves experts,” says Gil Eyal, author of “The Crisis of Expertise.” “Nuclear energy was a big issue at the time. Nuclear physicists were the experts on nuclear energy. But opponents of nuclear power began to argue that nuclear physicists weren’t expert when it came to public health or the consequences of a potential meltdown, or when it came to environmental issues and environmental racism.” Government organizations started to include experts of different stripes to contend with big problems. “Of course the more expertise you have, the more entangled you probably are, meaning your neutrality is questionable,” Mr. Eyal said. “So the answer to that problem was to add yet more stakeholders — advocates, members of the public — which made consensus even harder to achieve.” In essence, Mr. Eyal argues, a participatory system designed to build public trust causes people to lose faith in the system. The remedy, he says, is time. Researchers have a term, “inclusion friction,” he told me, for how bringing more voices into a process inevitably slows it down. Conflicts arise among different stakeholders, and public discussions require explanations and careful conversations. “To do inclusion right you have to take your time,” Mr. Eyal says. “You can’t present people with a fait accompli because they’ll understand the inclusion to have been a sham.” The problem is that some crises don’t afford the luxury of time. A deadly virus racing around the world, for example. Operation Warp Speed, the federal Covid-19 vaccine development program, saved countless lives but it also “moved faster than public consensus,” as Mr. Eyal points out, exacerbating skepticism. Some environmentalists argue that climate change is a crisis simply too big and fast moving for the snail’s pace of participatory democracy. ADVERTISEMENT The Dutch have resolved this conflict on the side of expertise. With fully a third of their country below sea level, the Dutch have lived in a state of existential crisis for as long as they have occupied what is essentially the gutter of Europe, where major rivers drain into the sea. When he was tasked by President Obama with Sandy recovery, Mr. Donovan, the Housing and Urban Development secretary, hopped a plane for the Netherlands and got a crash course in Dutch water management. During the 12th century, medieval Netherlanders established water boards: regional councils in charge of overseeing canals, rivers and everything else water-related. Today, Dutch water boards, in tandem with ecologists and engineers, still help determine national flood protection policies, including where people can or can’t live, and what needs to be built, or unbuilt, to safeguard against flooding. Elected politicians come and go; water boards are there to listen to science and take the long view. This doesn’t mean Dutch experts always get things right. Scientific understanding evolves. In 1953, a huge winter storm in the North Sea breached dikes and flooded much of western Netherlands. Nearly 2,000 people were killed. The Dutch still call it The Disaster. In response, officials undertook the Delta Works, a massive nationwide system of levees, sluices, dikes, dams and sea gates. But even while the Delta Works were under construction, ecologists began to realize that some of those barriers were killing flora and fauna and disrupting tidal flows. So, simultaneously, Dutch water managers attempted a new approach. Rather than just try to subjugate nature, they would also cede targeted areas to the rivers and sea. At huge cost, the Dutch deconstructed some major dams. They built water parks that doubled as reservoirs and designed plazas with sunken gardens and basketball courts that collected runoff when nearby canals overflowed. They ordered farmers to move from properties that, based on engineers’ calculations, would be needed as retention pools to prevent bigger cities downstream from flooding. Farmers weren’t happy. But the lesson of the Delta Works was that progress is not an endpoint. It’s a process. In the Netherlands, citizens give up a measure of autonomy in return for safety. Prevention is the priority there. In the United States, a different ethos reigns. Private-property owners whose homes flood or burn down receive federal emergency-relief funds to rebuild, and only recently have insurance companies begun to refuse — or to charge exponentially higher premiums — to insure some especially flood-prone and fire-prone homes. A nation steeped in individual liberty and Manifest Destiny is not accustomed to thinking about prevention or retreating from places too unsafe to occupy or too costly to save. “This is New York, not New Amsterdam,” as Mr. Eyal puts it. You can’t impose a method here, he says, that is the result of “collective learning handed down in big and small ways, over centuries. What we can learn from the Dutch,” he suggests, “is that some of our truisms are not as stable as we think — participation and transparency are not an absolute good — and then we have to figure out our own way.” Daniel Arnold for The New York Times In the meantime... we remain mired in processes that can take much too long to resolve urgent challenges, with neighbors battling neighbors, experts battling experts, and no one with a mandate to take the long view. ADVERTISEMENT Van C. Tran, a sociologist at the City University of New York’s Graduate Center who specializes in community relations, has also been following the East River Park story. Mr. Tran distinguishes between technical planning — the architecture, engineering, cost calculations — and social planning. Technical planning is the realm of experts. “Social planning — in this case how the park should be used — is where the community should have the most input,” he says. But in reality, there are many communities. He believes much of the opposition “comes from more-educated, organized factions in the neighborhood, which raises the larger question of voice and equality — whose voice is most essential and should be heard in the community process,” Mr. Tran says. “My first priority always goes to the voiceless.” Mr. Araos, the New York University graduate student, told me he believes finding common ground has to start long before a crisis arises. “The solution can’t just be more meetings or more ‘community voice’ — this doesn’t work by itself,” he said. The answer involves strengthening investments in public institutions so that neighborhoods are better prepared to deal collectively with existential threats like climate change or a pandemic. “At the time of planning a huge public work like in East River Park,” he continued, “the relationships we build through institutions like local schools or libraries can be the building blocks of civic trust, cohesion and respect.” Back in September, I met Mr. Bouw, the Dutch architect who helped design the BIG U, at the 34th Street ferry landing on the East River for a walk along the riverfront, so he could explain the mayor’s plan. We passed an elevated section of the F.D.R. Drive, not far from Bellevue Hospital, where floodgates as thick as bank-vault doors will be installed. Across a decrepit pedestrian bridge over the highway, we reached the park, passing an old playground with concrete chess tables where Ms. Ortiz told me she used to take her children to ride the seesaws. The new East River Park is expected to take at least five years to build and it is conceived to keep Lower East Siders dry during Sandy-like storms until 2050. By then, continued sea level rise could mean an upgrade will already be required. I asked Carrie Grassi, from the Mayor’s Office of Climate Resiliency, whether a neighborhood park, whose renovation will cost taxpayers more than $1 billion, should offer residents longer protection than that. Ms. Grassi said the new park will be engineered to support an additional two feet of landfill, should more extreme weather make that necessary. “You have to start somewhere,” she offered. Mr. Bouw basically agreed. “The park is an incremental step,” he said. “From an engineering and landscape design perspective the new plan is an improvement. Is it perfect? No. Did the city handle this well? No. Is it everything that ought to happen? No. But we don’t have time to wait for the perfect.” Or as Mr. Tran phrased it, “The process worked in the imperfect ways local government works.” ADVERTISEMENT I left Mr. Bouw and headed back north to watch workers installing the first riverfront fortifications. Around 23rd Street, a crew in yellow vests and hard hats removed old sewer pipes and assembled new drains. A different crew maneuvered concrete molds on either side of a new 10-foot-high flood wall along the riverfront. That’s where I found Ahmed Ibrahim, senior construction manager for the fortifications north of 15th Street. “This is a special project,” he told me. “I live in Staten Island and saw how desperate people there were during Sandy. Their houses flooded. Some of them lost everything and moved away. This project is special because nothing like it has been done here. But it’s also special because it shows we can build flood walls and new parks.” Maybe. When the federal government chose to subsidize the BIG U, the park was projected to be fortified by now. When the mayor announced the new design, the completion date was set for 2023. Then community members objected to closing the whole park at once, so a phasing plan was adopted for construction that pushed the completion date to 2025. Then came Covid and various lawsuits. Now the city says, barring further legal or other delays, East River Park should be done in 2026. Whenever it is finished, Ms. Ortiz told me, she plans to sit with her daughter by the river, in the shade of a new amphitheater, and watch the boats sail by.

" Hindsight is a series from the Headway team looking back at predictions and promises from the past. As the 2009 global climate summit in Copenhagen approached, the European Union raced to announce an ambitious target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The bloc’s leaders worked to smooth over the competing interests of more than two dozen members, settling on a three-part plan that it promised to meet by 2020, nicknamed the 20-20-20 Pledge: The bloc would reduce its emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels, increase renewable energy to 20 percent of electricity use, and increase energy efficiency by 20 percent. By the 2020 deadline, the European Union had achieved two of its three goals — an example of a major emitter achieving a climate pledge. Overall emissions were 24 percent lower than in 1990, by the bloc’s accounting, and renewable energy was about 20 percent of its electricity use. But many climate scientists and others involved in the process question the European Union’s accounting. There were stumbling blocks in the European Union’s plan to lower its carbon output. When it began in 2005, the bloc’s emissions trading system was the world’s most ambitious effort to put a price on polluting with carbon. But early on, that price was low enough that some considered the system worse than useless. By 2013, concerns about the system’s viability were so dire that the European Parliament stepped in to lift the price of carbon. Britain went even further, fixing the minimum price of carbon for power producers. These changes helped to bring about a shift: By 2017, coal had fallen to 7 percent of Britain’s electricity generation from 40 percent in 2013. As coal use declined across Europe, the power sector shifted to renewable sources. But that created its own controversy. ADVERTISEMENT “A fundamental mistake was made at the beginning, and we’re still suffering,” said Bas Eickhout, a Dutch politician and member of the European Parliament. Back in 2009, Eickhout was a scientist whose research pointed to the importance of rigorous standards for sustainability. He was dismayed when the European Union chose to count biomass energy as a renewable, carbon-neutral source, akin to wind and solar. Most biomass is wood that comes from cutting down forests and making the material into pellets. Because pellets can be burned in existing coal-fired power plants, they provide an easy, comparatively cheap way for countries to reduce their emissions — at least on paper. The European Union and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change — the main scientific body on climate change — count carbon emissions from biomass where the trees are cut down, not where the material is burned. That means the bloc’s accounting doesn’t factor in the carbon footprint of processing trees into wood pellets, shipping them across the ocean or burning them for fuel. ADVERTISEMENT Trees can regrow, which is why the European Union considers biomass renewable. But critics argue its true emissions impact has been underestimated. Seth Ginther, the executive director of the U.S. Industrial Pellet Association, a trade group, said that the southeastern United States, where much of the world’s biomass is currently harvested, had actually increased its forest stock in the past 50 years. But trees planted for timber aren’t as effective as native forests at storing carbon, and it can take many years — a century, by some estimates — for newly planted forests to accumulate as much carbon as mature ones. And burning wood can be even less efficient than burning coal; it releases more carbon into the atmosphere per megawatt produced. Europe’s renewable energy production has doubled since 2004. While solar power has grown the fastest, by 2016, biomass accounted for almost 60 percent of the bloc’s total renewable energy. Thanks in part to E.U. subsidies, the American wood pellet industry ballooned to around nine million tons in 2018 from 0.3 million tons in 2009. Because of the high cost of energy in Europe this past winter, 2021 is the first year that burning biomass has been profitable without government subsidies. The European Union’s most significant chance to address these criticisms came after the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015. There, the bloc committed to cut emissions by 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2030; that target was increased to 55 percent in 2021. To meet these promises, the European Union revised its renewable energy policies in 2018 and is in the process of doing so again. The revisions limit the use of woody biomass for energy and restrict its sourcing from highly biodiverse forests, but some environmental groups say the proposed standards still aren’t enough. Europe is still moving faster on more ambitious climate goals than other countries, including the United States. A United Nations report released in October found that even if every country in the world met its current targets, the world would still see 2.7 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century, which “would lead to catastrophic changes in the Earth’s climate.” In that light, was the European Union’s 2020 target ambitious enough? “Depends on your definition of ambition,” said Yvo de Boer, the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change from 2006 to 2010. “It was probably recognized as not being ambitious enough from the perspective of avoiding dangerous climate change. But I think from the perspective of politics, it was seen as sufficiently ambitious and a critical step in the right direction.” ADVERTISEMENT This Headway story and the others in this series are the first entries in an ongoing conversation about progress — how we define it and how we make it.

" Hindsight is a series from the Headway team looking back at predictions and promises from the past. When a shopper in New York, say, plucks a Milky Way bar from a grocery store shelf, that shopper becomes the final link in a long chain that might have started on a patch of land in Ghana, where a tropical forest recently stood. About 80 percent of the trees razed each year in the tropics are cleared to make space for growing cocoa, soybeans, palm oil and cattle that are the raw materials for chocolate, cereal, leather seats and thousands of other products. Ten years ago, some of the world’s largest companies, including Coca-Cola, Kellogg’s, Walmart and Mars, pledged to change their practices to help end deforestation by 2020. Some, like Nestle and Carrefour, went even further, saying they would eliminate deforestation from their supply chains altogether. The 2020 deadline arrived, and some companies reported advances toward their goal. No company, however, could say it had eliminated forest destruction from its supply chain. Many others did not even try, said Didier Bergeret, sustainability director for the Consumer Goods Forum, an industry group of more than 400 retailers and manufacturers that organized the pledge. And annual deforestation in the tropics, where trees store the most carbon and harbor the most biodiversity, has lately been on the rise. Many companies that committed to achieving “net zero” deforestation at first assumed the goal could be accomplished by buying from certified sustainable sellers, said Justin Adams, director of the Tropical Forest Alliance, an organization that helps companies meet their commitments. Looking back, Adams said, that was a naïve approach to a complex problem. ADVERTISEMENT For one thing, companies have to figure out exactly where their commodities come from. Mars, for example, is one of the world’s largest users of cocoa, which it buys from suppliers like Cargill. But those suppliers buy their cocoa, too, and at the beginning of the chain are the growers, some of whom are small farmers in Ivory Coast, Ghana and elsewhere. By the end of 2020, Mars said that it was able to trace about 43 percent of its cocoa to specific farms. The company has had better luck mapping its palm-oil supply chain. When it did, it discovered that its oil came from 1,500 palm-oil mills, a number the company described as “far too complex to manage.” It has since reduced that number to 87. Along with a nonprofit organization called the Earth Equalizer Foundation, it uses satellite imagery to monitor land use on the plantations it sources from to ensure they aren’t cutting down forest. Nestle reported in 2020 that its suppliers of palm oil, pulp, soy, sugar and meat were 90 percent deforestation-free. The company did some on-the-ground and satellite monitoring, but the determination largely drew on the fact that the commodities came from “low-risk regions” like Europe or the United States, where there is unlikely to be deforestation for products like soy. The company did not include cocoa or coffee in its original goal but said those crops would be part of its next effort to reach zero deforestation in 2025. If companies can’t track a commodity’s origin, they can’t be certain that it was grown without eliminating trees. As The New York Times recently documented, ranchers in Brazil operating on illegally deforested land sold at least 17,700 cattle over three and a half years to intermediaries, who then sold them to giant meatpackers. The original illegal farm did not appear in the supply chain documents. All of these factors make it difficult to rate the success of companies’ efforts. ADVERTISEMENT The companies that have voluntarily made progress on this front are in the minority, but some are pushing for these standards to be more widely adopted, and for governments to enact legislation that would force change across the entire industry. Laws and public pressure have already made a difference. Brazil is backsliding now — a result of President Jair Bolsonaro’s aggressive development policies in the Amazon — but just a few years ago, it was being hailed as a conservation success story. Between 2004 and 2012, deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon fell by 84 percent. Brazil brought more of the forest under legal protection and stepped up enforcement of illegal logging laws. In 2006, following an uproar from groups like Greenpeace, the Brazilian government also brokered a voluntary moratorium with major soy buyers like Cargill, which significantly reduced deforestation for soy. “What Brazil did to reduce deforestation could happen in other countries, and has happened to some extent in Indonesia,” said David Gibbs, research associate at the World Resources Institute. “But those reductions in deforestation are always potentially temporary and can be reversed.” “So in that way,” he added, “Brazil is both a hopeful tale and a cautionary tale.” In Indonesia, tropical forests and peatlands fell to the palm oil industry, which exploded in response to biodiesel incentives in the U.S. and Europe. The catastrophic environmental damage that followed galvanized new efforts to limit the clearing and burning of forest. Indonesia’s annual deforestation rate is now the lowest it has been in nearly 20 years, according to Global Forest Watch. This striking reversal shows what can happen with enough motivation. But recovering from damage is not nearly as easy as inflicting it. New trees can be planted, but it takes decades for trees to develop the “photosynthetic machinery” needed to sequester carbon at high rates, said Mark Harmon, a forest ecologist at Oregon State University. ADVERTISEMENT “It is not an instantaneously renewable resource,” he said. There is cause for hope, said Nadia Bishai of CDP, a nonprofit group that tracks and ranks companies that have the greatest influence on tropical deforestation. In the past, biodiversity was the main argument for preserving tropical forests. But “forests have become central to the climate discussion,” she said. And trees’ carbon sequestering powers motivated European Union rules aimed at curbing deforestation as well as the recent pledge by leaders of more than 100 countries, including Brazil, China and the United States, to end deforestation by 2030. The signatory countries are home to about 85 percent of the world’s forests, making it the most sweeping agreement yet on forest conservation. “I think we’re a bit more hopeful this time around,” Bishai said. “This collective action is the key for the future.” As companies’ 2010 pledges make clear, a vow is not an outcome. But it can at least point the way. This Headway story and the others in this series are the first entries in an ongoing conversation about progress — how we define it and how we make it.

" Advocates descended on the streets of Glasgow last month, pressing banks and other financial institutions at 26th United Nations climate summit to be more responsible stewards of the climate. But a bank based just 50 miles east of the Scottish city is already showing what that might look like. NatWest, formerly the Royal Bank of Scotland, has made the unlikely transformation from substantial financier of the oil and gas industry to a leader in green finance, whittling down its fossil fuel exposure and pledging to funnel 100 billion pounds, or $133 billion, into sustainable-energy projects in the next four years. The bank, with headquarters in Edinburgh, could serve as an example of the huge shift necessary for Britain’s banking and investment sector to become, in the government’s words, “the world’s first net-zero-aligned financial center.” Since Brexit, Britain’s financial industry has lost some of its luster, as London can no longer be used as a hub for European business. The Treasury, determined to maintain the nation’s eminence, is exploring other ways to attract investors, including loosening the rules for listing companies to attract founder-led tech start-ups and backing financial technology companies. But green finance could also be an answer. ADVERTISEMENT NatWest’s climate-friendly transformation has even earned the cautious praise of some of its protesters. Johan Frijns, a co-founder of BankTrack, a Dutch organization that pressures banks to give up financing fossil fuel projects, said NatWest could set a new benchmark for how to transform a large bank for a low-carbon economy. “We almost desperately want to see NatWest as a beacon of hope, as a bank that shows it can change,” Mr. Frijns said. “And it comes from very far. It was proud to be the oil and gas bank.” The transition at NatWest has been helped along by its diminished global stature. For a short period before the 2008 financial crisis, it was the largest bank in the world, by assets. But then, facing huge losses as the global credit squeeze hit hard, it was bailed out by the British government and reined in its ambitions. Now, reflecting its smaller, domestic focus, nearly half of its loan book is made up of mortgages. ADVERTISEMENT But over the past decade, NatWest has — first slowly, and then quickly — become more zealous in its climate-related goals. In 2012, it set aside £200 million for businesses to undertake energy-efficiency projects. Over the next few years, it helped finance more renewable-energy projects, including wind farms. In 2017, it reported that it didn’t directly finance any new coal mining or coal power projects. The year after that, NatWest said it would channel £10 billion into sustainable and climate financing over the next two years. But the biggest changes have come under the leadership of Alison Rose, who took over as chief executive in late 2019. Besides changing the bank’s name and distancing it from its crisis-stained past, Ms. Rose has said she wants to run a “purpose-led bank,” with a focus on “helping to address the climate challenge.” In October, the bank announced that it would channel £100 billion into financing for green and sustainable initiatives by the end of 2025. It said it would stop lending and underwriting major oil and gas producers if they hadn’t set out, by the end of this year, a transition plan aligned with restricting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels (the U.N. Paris agreement goal). The bank has also committed to a “complete phaseout” of investments touching on coal by the start of 2030, the same year it intends to have halved the carbon emissions from all its financing before getting to net zero in 2050. The bank’s transformation isn’t complete: At the end of September, NatWest’s exposure to major oil and gas companies, mostly from loans, was £1 billion, and £600 million to companies in which more than 15 percent of the activity relates to coal. But its priorities follow the path laid by the government, which has set a legally binding target for the country to cut carbon emissions by more than three-quarters by 2035 compared with 1990 levels, and reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Lawmakers are working out how to meet these objectives. Rishi Sunak, who as chancellor of the Exchequer is Britain’s highest financial officer, has presented a plan that initially asks, and eventually requires, financial institutions, including asset managers and pension funds, and publicly listed companies to publish how they will adapt their activities and investments to help the country meet its net zero targets. These transition plans would come on top of existing requirements to publish financial information about climate risks to their business operations and investments. “It’s a really positive indicator that the U.K. recognizes that it needs to take into account the emissions associated with its financial sector,” said Alison Kirsch of Rainforest Action Network, the lead author of its annual report on banks’ financing of fossil fuels. “It’s something that hasn’t happened in the U.S.” ADVERTISEMENT But, she added, the transition plans aren’t mandatory yet, and the British government has said it would let the market decide if the plans were adequate or credible. “We haven’t seen the market be a good judge on many things on climate,” she said. There are other ways Britain might struggle to meet its goals. Before the transition plans become mandatory, the government is setting up a task force to determine what a good plan looks like. It isn’t expected to report back for another year, even though some international groups have already provided guidance on transition plans, delaying mandatory reporting. And the government has explicitly stated that these transition plans are not designed to ban investments in carbon-intensive activities. “The rules are all about disclosure — and disclosure is very helpful — but it’s not in and of itself going to solve anything,” said Chris Stark, the chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change, a watchdog funded by the British government to advise lawmakers on environmental policies. “But I think it is an important first step to then have more action,” added Mr. Stark, whose group recommended that Britain commit to being a net-zero-aligned financial center. Britain is one of several countries trying to reach climate goals using financial regulations. But advocates say that to be a leader of this group, which also includes France, more needs to be done. “If you’re really serious about being a net-zero-aligned financial center, then you’ve got to move to mandatory reporting really quickly,” said Bethan Livesey of ShareAction, a British charity. “And you’ve got to have an accountability mechanism in there.” ADVERTISEMENT The transition plans also need to show investments in sustainable-energy and green projects, said Chris Dodwell of Impax Asset Management, a former climate negotiator for the British government. Meeting Britain’s climate goals will require a fivefold increase by 2030 in investments into, for example, electric vehicles and alternatives to gas boilers in houses, according to the Committee on Climate Change. As the finance industry tries to rewire itself to meet these goals, NatWest’s reputation as a leader faces an imminent test. It is a month away from the deadline it gave big oil and gas companies to provide a credible transition plan — or lose the bank’s lending and underwriting services. Advocates want to know the threat of walking away is real. The bank has already told some companies that it can’t finance them in the future, based on the information they have provided, said James Close, a former director of climate change at the World Bank who joined NatWest this year to help lead its climate change strategy. He said these companies were coming back to the bank to check that the information was right. “It’s a conversation — it’s not a kind of one-off decision,” Mr. Close said. “And then we’ll have to evaluate.” While NatWest’s business with oil and gas companies is smaller than some other large British banks, Mr. Frijns of BankTrack doesn’t intend on lifting the pressure. “I promise that if at the end of this year we basically see business as usual for NatWest, then they will be the target of campaigning next year just like any other bank,” he said."
" GENEVA — When the United Nations made its last appeal for humanitarian aid funding before the pandemic, it asked donors for about $29 billion. But in the past year alone, there has been a huge jump in the number of people needing help. And so the United Nations is asking for more aid — $41 billion. As the pandemic enters a third year, and the toll of conflicts and climate change rise, the United Nations said on Thursday that it needed to help 183 million people in 63 countries who are suffering the consequences. That compared with 100 million people at the time of the last appeal, in 2019. More than 1 percent of the world’s population are now displaced by conflicts and disasters, Martin Griffiths, the United Nations emergency relief coordinator, told reporters in Geneva in announcing the organization’s 2022 funding drive. About 45 million people now face famine, some as a result of climate change. The pandemic has already forced 20 million people into extreme poverty, he said, citing World Bank estimates, and the new Omicron variant would further ratchet up the economic damage. “With Covid continuing to threaten us and continuing to mutate, we will continue to see increased humanitarian needs,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT The funding needed for humanitarian aid has doubled in four years and nine country programs now required aid of more than a billion dollars each, according to the United Nations. At the top of the list are Afghanistan and Syria, which each need more than $4 billion. They are followed by Yemen, which needs $3.9 billion. International aid in 2021 averted the threat of famine in South Sudan and Yemen where U.N. agencies provided food for 10 million people. But many aid programs are severely underfunded, forcing aid agencies to cut back food rations. “Without immediate and sustained action to prevent famine, humanitarian needs will far exceed those in the last decade,” the United Nations said in its appeal. Mr. Griffiths expressed particular alarm over the conflict in Ethiopia, where the United Nations is trying to distribute aid to nine million people in the war-torn north and an additional 21 million people in the rest of the country. He also highlighted political challenges to providing assistance to Afghanistan, where the effects of severe drought and economic collapse have left 24 million people confronting acute hunger. But international aversion to aiding the Taliban has led to a freeze on international reserves and banking transactions. ADVERTISEMENT Donor governments needed assurances that funding did not empower the Taliban, Mr. Griffiths said, but to enable payment of employee salaries, “the world has to understand that there is a need for putting money through state structures.”"
" Back-to-back years of little precipitation in the Indian Ocean nation of Madagascar have ruined harvests and caused hundreds of thousands of people to face uncertainty about their next meals. Aid groups say the situation there is nearing a humanitarian catastrophe. But human-induced climate change does not appear to be the driving cause, a team of climate scientists said on Wednesday. Rainfall in the hard-hit south of Madagascar naturally fluctuates quite a lot, the researchers said, and they did not find that a warming climate was making prolonged droughts significantly more likely. Even so, they emphasized the island should still aim to bolster its ability to cope with dry spells. Scientists convened by the United Nations have determined that droughts in Madagascar as a whole will likely increase if global average temperatures rise by more than 2 degrees Celsius — a higher level of warming than the 1.2 degrees that was considered in the new analysis. ADVERTISEMENT Average global temperatures have already increased by 1.1 degrees Celsius compared with preindustrial levels. Scientists have said that nations need to try to prevent temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, which is the threshold beyond which they say the likelihood of catastrophic fires, floods, drought, heat waves and other disasters significantly increases. Current policies put the planet on pace for roughly 3 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100. “What it shows is that the current climate variability is already resulting in severe humanitarian suffering,” said Maarten van Aalst, director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center and one of the 20 scientists involved in the Madagascar study. “In these sorts of places, anything that climate change would make worse would become a really big additional problem really quickly.” Madagascar, a large island off Africa’s eastern coast, is known for its sandy beaches, emerald waters and ring-tailed lemurs. But low rainfall since 2019 in the nation’s southwestern end — which is known as Le Grand Sud, or the Deep South — has left that part of the island in a dire state. More than 1.3 million people, or nearly half the Grand Sud’s population, are experiencing high levels of food insecurity, according to the United Nations. Half a million children under the age of 5 are at risk of severe malnutrition. ADVERTISEMENT The climate researchers estimated that such a long dryspell had a one-in-135 chance of occurring in any given year in that part of Madagascar. Environmental degradation has exacerbated the drought’s effects. Sandstorms fueled by deforestation have ruined cropland and pastures. An outbreak of locusts threatens further destruction. Residents of the Grand Sud have been forced to eat grass, leaves and even clay to survive, the United Nations World Food Program has found. Children have quit school to help their families forage for food. Amnesty International has collected testimonies suggesting that some people have died of hunger. The analysis of the drought was conducted by an international scientific collaboration called the World Weather Attribution initiative, which specializes in pinpointing the links between climate change and individual weather events. The group performs such analyses with a speed that is unusual in the scientific publishing world: It aims to present sound science to the public while events are still fresh in people’s minds. The team’s Madagascar study has not been peer reviewed, though it relies on peer-reviewed methods. Essentially, the approach is to use computer simulations to compare the existing world, in which humans have pumped greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, to a hypothetical one without that activity. It may seem counterintuitive that global warming does not contribute to a clear increase in the likelihood of drought. Scientists have found, however, that the relationship is not so simple. Climate change generally causes more intense rain events, but it also shifts rainfall patterns. ADVERTISEMENT “Drought has so many dimensions,” Dr. van Aalst said. “It’s not as straightforward as just, how much average annual rainfall do you get? The question is also, do you get it nicely distributed, or do you just get it in massive amounts at once? Do you get it in the right seasons?” “We have to be a bit careful,” he added, “drawing too straight a line from purely our precipitation observations or projections to what people in the end suffer from.” World Weather Attribution has linked other extreme weather events to human-caused climate change in recent years. The group found that this summer’s extraordinary heat wave in the Pacific Northwest almost certainly would not have occurred without it. For climate scientists, “droughts are a combination of factors that’s much more difficult to deal with” than, say, heat waves, said Piotr Wolski of the Climate System Analysis Group at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. “We have this predominant narrative these days that droughts are driven largely by anthropogenic climate change,” said Dr. Wolski, who also worked on the Madagascar study. “It’s not a bad narrative, because they are — it’s just not everywhere and not in every single case.” In Madagascar, livelihoods are easily destabilized by wild swings in precipitation, said Daniel Osgood, a research scientist at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University who was not involved in the study. Dr. Osgood is working on a project to provide affordable drought insurance to growers in Madagascar. The goal is to help them become more resilient to the economic shocks that weather can bring about. “It’s not how much you eat on average,” he said. “It’s how much you eat every night that really makes a difference.”"
" We’re also covering a political struggle that could shape the future of clean energy, a U.S. government report on oil drilling that barely mentions climate change, and albatross divorces. By Christopher Flavelle The largest museum complex in the world is struggling to protect itself against the effects of climate change — a warning about the difficulty of adapting to warming, even for organizations with top experts and deep pockets. In a document issued this fall, the Smithsonian Institution warned that increased flooding on the National Mall, the two-mile-long park in the heart of Washington that houses most of its museums, threatened to outpace the Smithsonian’s ability to defend those museums and their priceless contents. Smithsonian managers agreed to give me and a New York Times photographer, Erin Schaff, a tour beneath its most flood-exposed building, the National Museum of American History. We saw a storage room filled with centuries’ worth of porcelain, where a tarp-and-trash-can contraption had been set up in the corner to catch water coming from the ceiling. Storm water also comes through first-floor windows, air ducts and even gurgles up through the ground. Museum workers have been experimenting with a series of defenses, including flood barriers outside of windows and beneath doors, electronic water alarms throughout the building and buckets full of an absorbent cat litter that can be rushed to the site of a flood. Longer-term solutions, including flood gates around the building and moving items to a new storage facility in suburban Maryland, are years away. You can read my article here. ADVERTISEMENT Quotable: “We follow rain like you wouldn’t believe,” said Nancy Bechtol, head of facilities for the Smithsonian. “We’re constantly watching those weather forecasts to know whether we’ve got one coming.” By Dionne Searcey Business is booming at mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The country produces about two-thirds of the world’s cobalt, and cobalt is vital for the batteries in electric vehicles. But Congo also has a problem: A reputation for tolerating dangerous, makeshift mining operations where unskilled and poorly equipped workers, including children, get exploited, injured and killed. ADVERTISEMENT Some leaders in Congo want to clean up the industry. But the man who has put himself in charge of the effort, Albert Yuma Mulimbi, chairman of the state mining enterprise, is a problem, according to Congolese and American officials. They accuse him of abusing his position to enrich friends, family members and political allies. Mr. Yuma denies any wrongdoing and has carried out elaborate lobbying campaigns to clear his name in Washington and in Congo’s capital, Kinshasa. Will Mr. Yuma help the country ride the global green wave into an era of new prosperity, or will he help condemn it to more strife and turmoil? You can read our investigation into Mr. Yuma’s dealings, the third in a series of articles I wrote with my Times colleague Eric Lipton. And, please check out the first two installments: Part 1 looks at how Congo’s vast reserves of cobalt gave the country a central role in the electric vehicle revolution. Part 2 examines how, despite decades of U.S. diplomatic efforts, China came to dominate cobalt mining in Congo. By Coral Davenport An Interior Department report has recommended that the federal government raise the fees that oil and gas companies pay to drill on public lands. But the report was nearly silent about the climate effects from drilling on public land. The United States Geological Survey estimates that drilling on public land and in federal waters is responsible for almost a quarter of the greenhouse gases generated by the United States that are warming the planet. ADVERTISEMENT As I reported with my NYT climate team colleague Lisa Friedman, the silence angered some environmentalists, who want the federal government to consider the climate effects of drilling when it weighs applications for new leases. That would be a step toward ending new oil and gas drilling on public lands, something President Biden promised during his campaign. Back story: If royalty rates for drilling do go up, it would be the first increase since 1920. Canadians are repairing washed-out roads and destroyed bridges — and wondering what climate disasters could hit next. New transmission line projects could bring clean energy to New York City from upstate and Canada. By Natasha Frost It can take many years for albatrosses to find the one. But once they do, it’s almost always for keeps. The huge sea birds are among the most monogamous creatures on the planet. Typically, albatross couples separate only if they’ve been unable to successfully raise a chick. (For castoff males, who seldom instigate a split, breaking up usually heralds a lifetime of bachelorhood.) Now, though, researchers say some albatross separations could be linked to climate change. According to a 15-year survey of 15,500 breeding pairs of black-browed albatrosses in the Falkland Islands, the separation rate among the birds rises to almost 8 percent, from an average of about 4 percent, in years when the sea is at its warmest. ADVERTISEMENT Francesco Ventura, a Ph.D. student in conservation biology at the University of Lisbon and the lead author of a recent paper on the survey, told me in an interview for my article this week on albatross divorce that researchers already knew that breeding failures are more common in years when the water is warmer. Still, that alone doesn’t fully account for the increase in separations. “We see there is still something that is left unexplained,” he said. One possible explanation may be that the females, stressed out by an unusually warm environment, mistake their unlucky male partners as the source of the strain and decide they’d be better off without them. For now, the Falklands albatross population in the study is thriving. Though splits are more common than before, the birds’ overall ability to breed seems mostly unimpeded. But Ventura said the results showed us how little we know about climate change’s potential to wreak havoc in unexpected places. “We very arrogantly thought that we can measure it all, we understand it all, we know it all,” he said. “That’s actually not true.” If you’re not getting Climate Fwd: in your inbox, you can sign up here We’d love your feedback on the newsletter.

" Washed-out roads and destroyed bridges are just some of the devastation afflicting residents of the western province and could signal what climate change will bring in the future. By Ian Austen Photographs by Ian Willms PRINCETON, British Columbia — With light drizzle in the air, a young woman wiped away tears as she stood on the veranda of a newly renovated gray and white house. Its toilets and other plumbing fixtures sat beside her. Most of the house’s other contents were on the street in a muddy pile. Three doors down, a chain of soldiers in green camouflage fatigues stacked sandbags atop a rock-and-earth dike intended to keep the Tulameen River out of modest homes on Allison Avenue. The engine noise and reverse warning beeps of a small excavator filled the air as it scraped up mud, soggy mattresses, end tables, chairs, tools and VHS cassettes of children’s cartoons. The heavy rains that caused flooding in Princeton and across southern British Columbia were the third large-scale natural disaster this part of Canada has endured in six months — the likely cumulative effects of climate change, according to climate experts. ADVERTISEMENT Record-breaking heat waves, flooding and wildfires have killed hundreds of British Columbians and have highlighted Canada’s vulnerability to extreme weather. On their own, each event has caused widespread devastation, but they are perhaps even more profound, according to researchers, because they followed one another in this sequence, producing so-called “compound effects.” Western Canada suffered a blistering heat wave for much of the summer as record-high temperatures caused uncontrolled forest fires that burned one community to the ground. Now, the region is facing washed-out roads and highways, mud-clogged houses and destroyed bridges after nearly a foot of rain poured from a weather event known as an atmospheric river — long bands of water vapor that form over the Pacific Ocean and drift to North America every fall and winter. Forecasts of more heavy rainfall for this week have renewed flooding worries and prompted precautionary closings of highway routes that had just reopened. “We have not had this number of atmospheric rivers in such a short time period hitting into the coast,” said Rachel White, a professor at the University of British Columbia who studies how large-scale atmospheric patterns contribute to extreme weather. “The scary possibility is that climate change is making those more likely and more frequent.” ADVERTISEMENT Last week, Bonnie and Bryan Webber finished stuffing the last of their salvageable belongings into a small pickup truck after floodwaters ravaged their 700-square-foot home, which sits directly beside the dike in Princeton, a town of 2,800 residents. They bought their house 22 years ago and moved from the Vancouver area shortly afterward, when Mr. Webber retired from the city’s sewer and drainage department. “I just can’t believe it’s been 12 days already,” Mrs. Webber said last Thursday, her voice tinged with bewilderment and exhaustion. ""Everyone’s overwhelmed in emotions now and it’s physically trying, too. Everybody needs help.” At least 12,000 British Columbians remained displaced by the floods this week, most with no clear return date. Some communities remained evacuated. Schools and one major railway route were closed. And large sections of highways critical to moving goods from Vancouver to the rest of Canada have been closed by landslides, flooding, washouts and collapsed bridges. Partial reopenings are weeks away for some highways and full restoration will take months, perhaps longer. ADVERTISEMENT The cost remains anyone’s guess. “This won’t be cheap, that’s for sure,” said Ian Pilkington, the province’s chief engineer of highways. “But even at this point, we’re still assessing and trying to figure out what we need to do.” For many people in the province, looming above it all is a nagging fear that the weather turmoil is a sign of what climate change will bring. Sam Parara, a transit bus driver in Vancouver, had planned to start a new life in a Princeton house he recently purchased and was renovating. As he carried a pile of objects so mud-covered as to be unidentifiable to the curb, Mr. Parara said he’s concerned about the long-term implications of his province’s weather disasters. “I’ve listened to David Suzuki talking about climate change for a long time,” he said referring to the Canadian broadcaster, geneticist and environmentalist. “All of a sudden, the climate is very unpredictable,” he said. “Maybe we need to think about doing things in a different way.” Experts are unclear as to whether this year’s weather is a direct result of climate change. Many, however, say they are certain that climate change worsened the effects. ADVERTISEMENT The drought, for example, dried out vegetation, which in turn fueled and intensified fires. Fire itself can weaken or kill plants and make the soil less permeable, so rain is more likely to run off, not soak in. This can create conditions for the types of dangerous landslides and mudslides seen in recent weeks. While atmospheric rivers are the primary source of rainfall along the west coast, models show that atmospheric river storms are likely to strengthen and intensify from warmer air, which can hold more moisture. Two weeks ago in British Columbia, a pair of atmospheric river storms struck in quick succession. “Those back-to-back storms are where we get the biggest impact,” said Marty Ralph, the director of the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Dr. Ralph noted the second storm stalled, which can create longer rainfalls over one location. Those conditions “were sort of a kicker that pushed things over the edge.” As the water raged down the mountainsides in the region and then along the Fraser River into Vancouver, its destruction took many forms. ADVERTISEMENT In the town of Merritt, a river had poured into the sewage treatment plant, forcing the evacuation of all 5,300 residents. The torrent carved a new path for the river through town, felling a bridge, sweeping a mobile home downstream and leaving another partly submerged while destroying parts of the drinking water system. Much of the ranch land of the nearby Shackan First Nation was consumed by a swollen river. Not only is the road into the area gone, Chief Arnold Lampreau said, the spring runoff may reveal new flood dangers. The Trans Mountain pipeline, which links Alberta’s oil sands to refineries in Washington State and a port in suburban Vancouver, was left with several sections uncovered or underwater. No leaks were reported, but the pipeline operator shut it down, with hopes to at least partly reopen this week. Mr. Pilkington, the highway engineer chief, has been using helicopters to airlift equipment and workers into otherwise inaccessible areas that need rebuilding. The temporary fixes to some main highways may take until the new year to complete, he said. But the long-term repairs will be guided by a new approach: climate forecasts, instead of historical data, to determine the height of bridges, the size of culverts and capacity of drainage systems. “To now realize that historical data is not relevant and that if you rely on it, you’ll under design every time — that’s an interesting thing for engineers have to wrap their head around,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT Despite the devastation, Princeton was alive with cleanup efforts last week. Volunteers, often from nearby communities, roamed in white disposable suits helping residents remove waterlogged appliances, sewage-contaminated mud and sodden drywall. In the midst of the muck, a group of schoolteachers commuted to the town every day and set up a table with trays of homemade sandwiches and baked goods, as well as large pots of soup for the cleanup volunteers and residents. “In the springtime with the runoff, you’re expecting, you’re watching but, come on, this never happens in November,” said Denise Cook, who grew up in Princeton and came back to volunteer. “I never would have thought that it would be as bad as this is. It’s bad. People sitting at home watching this, they have no idea.” Vjosa Isai and Winston Choi-Schagrin contributed reporting."
" GLASGOW — Inver restaurant is but a speck on the longest sea loch in Scotland. From its windows, a diner can see the remnants of a 15th-century castle and the rolling hills of the Highlands, but the breakout star is not the view. It’s a meaty halibut head that the chef Pam Brunton grills over wood and finishes with melted homemade ’nduja and a tangle of grilled green onions. The small halibut she butchers have been raised in sea-fed pens on the Isle of Gigha, a nearby community-owned island whose farmed halibut have become the darling of people who care a lot about where their fish and shellfish come from. Ms. Brunton, who could be Alice Waters’s Scottish niece, runs Inver with her partner, Rob Latimer. The tiny restaurant and inn is about 70 miles from Glasgow, where in November heads of state, including President Biden, thousands of diplomats and a flood of environmental activists like Greta Thunberg gathered for COP26, the United Nations global climate conference. ADVERTISEMENT Ms. Brunton’s halibut heads may not seem like much of a hedge against the catastrophic effects of fossil fuel and methane gas emissions, but a group of cooks and diners here say that putting sustainable Scottish seafood on the plate is at least one tangible (and delicious) move toward a better planet. The shift is away from fin and shellfish whose populations are threatened by climate change or harvesting practices. “It’s all part of an incremental change,” Ms. Burton said in an interview before participating in a panel on food waste, hosted by The New York Times Climate Hub, that coincided with COP26. “Inver restaurant is not going to change anything in its life span, but hopefully we are helping the current move in this direction, not that direction. We are changing the flow.” Guy Grieve of the Ethical Shellfish Company, on the Isle of Mull, looks at his work in the same way. He brings hand-harvested Scottish scallops, rope-grown mussels and creel-caught crab and langoustine to city-bound cooks in Britain. In 2010, Mr. Grieve began diving for king scallops in the waters of western Scotland. His catch — with shells six inches across and crescents of orange roe attached to the muscle — went to restaurants whose chefs didn’t want to sell scallops dredged from the ocean floor using methods that reduce their population and ruin marine habitats. “We’re trying to pick the apples in the garden without trampling the flowers,” he said. When the coronavirus pandemic arrived, restaurants in Britain shut down. Mr. Grieve and fellow divers on other boats went from gathering about 10,000 scallops a week to zero. He had to sell his fishing boats. To make money, he began helping other divers sell their catch to whatever markets he could find. ADVERTISEMENT One promising market, much to his delight, was home cooks in Edinburgh. Although the restaurant trade is back, his company still delivers about 50 cardboard boxes of scallops to private homes, each order carefully packed in sheep’s wool for insulation. Those customers are just one indication that the number of Scottish cooks and diners who care about the provenance of their fish is growing, he said. Some of the appeal is the romance of food from Scotland’s west coast, where Scottish kings are buried and the first Celtic church in Scotland was built in about 563 A.D. “It’s a really compelling place for people to be sourcing their food,” he said. “In people’s minds, you’re bringing them stuff from their dreamland.” But the health of the climate and the environment matter, too. “There’s a degree of indignation that is coming out, and it’s great,” he said. “Unfortunately, there is a never-ending tide that will never stop and it’s called greed. All we can do is create little diversions.” Seafood is Scotland’s largest food export. Almost 400,000 tons were landed in 2020. That doesn’t include wild salmon, which are no longer fished commercially anywhere in Britain. Scotland, however, is the third-largest producer of farmed Atlantic salmon. Langoustine, the slender, delicate relative to the lobster, is the most valuable catch; more than two-thirds of the world’s supply comes from Scottish waters. ADVERTISEMENT Before Britain’s split from the European Union, or Brexit, most Scottish seafood went straight to markets like Spain and France. Brexit red tape has made European trade extremely difficult and the local Scottish and broader British markets more attractive. But getting seafood — especially niche items like Mr. Grieve’s scallops or the Gigha halibut — into the kitchens of home cooks is still a challenge, said Rachel McCormack, a food writer and broadcaster based in Glasgow. “The difficulty of promoting Scottish fish within Scotland is a very big topic,” she said. Scottish fishmongers are few and far between. “Supermarkets have a stranglehold on the food supply, and aren’t interested in Scottish fish unless it’s cheap farmed salmon.” Ms. McCormack’s two favorite things from Scottish waters are the Gigha halibut, which she roasts with salsa verde made from capers, parsley and coriander, and langoustine, which she cooks in butter, garlic, ginger and white wine and then works her way through “with bread and some langoustine pliers I got in Spain.” She sends visitors who are looking for a restaurant with a lot of Scottish seafood to Crabshakk. The architect John Macleod and his wife, Lynne Jones, opened the cozy, two-tiered restaurant in what was then a desolate part of the city, in 2009, when the economy was crashing and most of the fish at restaurants was covered in batter. It was an instant hit and has remained so popular that the couple plans to open a second outpost in West Glasgow early next year. ADVERTISEMENT Over an espresso, Mr. Macleod talked about how he is constantly adjusting his menu with the climate in mind. The conversation followed a long lunch that starred scallops from the waters around the Isle of North Uist, sizzling in anchovy butter, and crab cakes made with mounds of Scotland’s sweet brown crabs. He grew up on the Isle of Lewis, part of the ancestral homeland of the Highland Clan MacLeod on the far reaches of the Scottish west coast, where almost everyone he knew was in the fishing business. “Cod was in my bones and right into my toenails and fingernails,” he said. He’s specific about what he likes. He still serves wild halibut because he prefers the firmer flesh, but he is most likely going to replace the Scottish cod with hake, whose fishery isn’t under as much pressure. His chefs have dedicated themselves to finding more uses for all parts of the fish. “We’re not in the business of just taking it and ‘what the hell,’” he said about the environmental impact, “but it’s not quite as easy as people might imagine to feed people at volume and be right in there with every single product on the menu being as sustainable as it can be.” But the pressure is building, especially from a new generation of eaters who care about both what’s on the plate and how it got there. “It’s a new day,” said Ruaridh Fraser, 24, who waits tables at Crabshakk. “People have the fear in them now.” Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.

" KASULO, Democratic Republic of Congo — A man in a pinstripe suit with a red pocket square walked around the edge of a giant pit one April afternoon where hundreds of workers often toil in flip-flops, burrowing deep into the ground with shovels and pickaxes. His polished leather shoes crunched on dust the miners had spilled from nylon bags stuffed with cobalt-laden rocks. The man, Albert Yuma Mulimbi, is a longtime power broker in the Democratic Republic of Congo and chairman of a government agency that works with international mining companies to tap the nation’s copper and cobalt reserves, used in the fight against global warming. Mr. Yuma’s professed goal is to turn Congo into a reliable supplier of cobalt, a critical metal in electric vehicles, and shed its anything-goes reputation for tolerating an underworld where children are put to work and unskilled and ill-equipped diggers of all ages get injured or killed. ADVERTISEMENT “We have to reorganize the country and take control of the mining sector,” said Mr. Yuma, who had pulled up to the Kasulo site in a fleet of SUVs carrying a high-level delegation to observe the challenges there. But to many in Congo and the United States, Mr. Yuma himself is a problem. As chairman of Gécamines, Congo’s state-owned mining enterprise, he has been accused of helping to divert billions of dollars in revenues, according to confidential State Department legal filings reviewed by The New York Times and interviews with a dozen current and former officials in both countries. Top State Department officials have tried to force him out of the mining agency and pushed for him to be put on a sanctions list, arguing he has for years abused his position to enrich friends, family members and political allies. Mr. Yuma denies any wrongdoing and is waging an elaborate lobbying and legal campaign to clear his name in Washington and Congo’s capital of Kinshasa, all while pushing ahead with his plans to overhaul cobalt mining. ADVERTISEMENT Effectively operating his own foreign policy apparatus, Mr. Yuma has hired a roster of well-connected lobbyists, wired an undisclosed $1.5 million to a former White House official, offered the United States purported intelligence about Russia and critical minerals and made a visit to Trump Tower in New York, according to interviews and confidential documents. Mr. Yuma met with Donald Trump Jr. there in 2018, a session the mining executive described as a quick meet-and-greet. Despite such high-level access during the Trump administration, he was barred just two months later from entering the United States. His grip on the mining industry has complicated Congo’s effort to attract new Western investors and secure its place in the clean energy revolution, which it is already helping to fuel with its vast wealth of minerals and metals like cobalt. Batteries containing cobalt reduce overheating in electric cars and extend their range, but the metal has become known as “the blood diamond of batteries” because of its high price and the perilous conditions in Congo, the largest producer of cobalt in the world. As a result, carmakers concerned about consumer blowback are rapidly moving to find alternatives to the element in electric vehicles, and they are increasingly looking to other nations with smaller reserves as possible suppliers. There is a chance that Congo’s role in the emerging economy could be diminished if it fails to confront human-rights issues in its mines. And even if Mr. Yuma works to resolve those problems, as he has pledged to do, it still may not be enough for new American investors who want to be assured the country has taken steps to curb a history of mining-industry corruption. Congo’s president, Felix Tshisekedi, has tried to sideline Mr. Yuma by stacking Gécamines with his own appointees, but he has been unwilling to cross him further. During an interview at his hillside palace in Kinshasa, Mr. Tshisekedi said he had his own strategy for fixing the country’s dangerous mining conditions. ADVERTISEMENT “It is not going to be up to Mr. Yuma,” he said. “It will be the government that will decide.” The standoff between Mr. Yuma and the president echoes power struggles that have torn apart African countries rich with natural resources in the past. How this one plays out has implications that reach far beyond the continent, as the global battle against climate change calls for a stepped-up transition from gasoline-burning vehicles to battery-powered ones. For Congo, the question boils down to this: Will Mr. Yuma help the country ride the global green wave into an era of new prosperity, or will he help condemn it to more strife and turmoil? Statues greet motorists at the main roundabout in a mining hub in Congo’s Copperbelt. One depicts an industrial miner in hard hat, headlamp and boots; another a shoeless, shirtless man in ragged shorts holding a pickax. They tell the story of the country’s dual mining economies: industrial and artisanal. High-tech, industrial mines run by global corporations like China Molybdenum employ thousands of people in Congo’s cobalt sector, and while they have their own problems, they are largely not responsible for the country’s tarnished reputation abroad. Players in the clean energy revolution are increasingly caught in a cycle of exploitation and greed over resources. At the center of it is the quest for a prized metal: cobalt, a key ingredient in electric cars. It’s a different story for the artisanal sector, where Mr. Yuma plans to focus the bulk of his stated reforms. Consisting of ordinary adults with no formal training, and sometimes even children, artisanal mining is mostly unregulated and often involves trespassers scavenging on land owned by the industrial mines. Along the main highway bisecting many of the mines, steady streams of diggers on motorbikes loaded down with bags of looted cobalt — each worth about $175 — dodge checkpoints by popping out of sunflower thickets. ADVERTISEMENT Unable to find other jobs, thousands of parents send their children in search of cobalt. On a recent morning, a group of young boys were hunched over a road running through two industrial mines, collecting rocks that had dropped off large trucks. The work for other children is more dangerous — in makeshift mines where some have died after climbing dozens of feet into the earth through narrow tunnels that are prone to collapse. Kasulo, where Mr. Yuma is showcasing his plans, illustrates the gold-rush-like fervor that can trigger the dangerous mining practices. The mine, authorized by Gécamines, is nothing more than a series of crude gashes the size of city blocks that have been carved into the earth. Once a thriving rural village, Kasulo became a mining strip after a resident uncovered chunks of cobalt underneath a home. The discovery set off a frenzy, with hundreds of people digging up their yards. Today, a mango tree and a few purple bougainvillea bushes, leftovers of residents’ gardens, are the only remnants of village life. Orange tarps tied down with frayed ropes block rainwater from flooding the hand-dug shafts where workers lower themselves and chip at the rock to extract chunks of cobalt. Georges Punga is a regular at the mine. Now 41, Mr. Punga said he started working in diamond mines when he was 11. Ever since, he has traveled the country searching Congo’s unrivaled storehouse for treasures underfoot: first gold, then copper, and, for the past three years, cobalt. Mr. Punga paused from his digging one afternoon and tugged his dusty blue trousers away from his sneakers. Scars crisscrossed his shins from years of injuries on the job. He earns less than $10 a day — just enough, he said, to support his family and keep his children in school instead of sending them to the mines. ADVERTISEMENT “If I could find another job, I’d do it,” he said. “I’m tired of digging.” On most days, hundreds of men trudge into this mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo wearing plastic headlamps and hoisting shovels in search of treasure underground: cobalt. Here’s the backstory →        Officials in Congo have begun taking corrective steps, including creating a subsidiary of Gécamines to try to curtail the haphazard methods used by the miners, improve safety and stop child labor, which is already illegal. Under the plan, miners at sites like Kasulo will soon be issued hard hats and boots, tunneling will be forbidden and pit depths will be regulated to prevent collapses. Workers will also be paid more uniformly and electronically, rather than in cash, to prevent fraud. As chairman of the board of directors, Mr. Yuma is at the center of these reforms. That leaves Western investors and mining companies that are already in Congo little choice but to work with him as the growing demand for cobalt makes the small-scale mines — which account for as much as 30 percent of the country’s output — all the more essential. Once the cobalt is mined, a new agency will buy it from the miners and standardize pricing for diggers, ensuring the government can tax the sales. Mr. Yuma envisions a new fund to offer workers financial help if cobalt prices decline. Right now, diggers often sell the cobalt at a mile-long stretch of tin shacks where the sound of sledgehammers smashing rocks drowns out all other noise. There, international traders crudely assess the metal’s purity before buying it, and miners complain of being cheated. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Yuma led journalists from The Times on a tour of Kasulo and a nearby newly constructed warehouse and laboratory complex intended to replace the buying shacks. “We are going through an economic transition, and cobalt is the key product,” said Mr. Yuma, who marched around the pristine but yet-to-be-occupied complex, showing it off like a proud father. Seeking solutions for the artisanal mining problem is a better approach than simply turning away from Congo, argues the International Energy Agency, because that would create even more hardships for impoverished miners and their families. But activists point out that Mr. Yuma’s plans, beyond spending money on new buildings, have yet to really get underway, or to substantially improve conditions for miners. And many senior government officials in both Congo and the United States question if Mr. Yuma is the right leader for the task — openly wondering if his efforts are mainly designed to enhance his reputation and further monetize the cobalt trade while doing little to curb the child labor and work hazards. Bottles of Dom Pérignon were chilling on ice beside Mr. Yuma as he sat in his Gécamines office, where chunks of precious metals and minerals found in Congo’s soil were encased in glass. He downed an espresso before his interview with The Times, surrounded by contemporary Congolese art from his private collection. His lifestyle, on open display, was clear evidence, he said, that he need not scheme or steal to get ahead. “I was 20 years old when I drove my first BMW in Belgium, so what are we talking about?” he said of allegations that he had pilfered money from the Congolese government. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Yuma is one of Congo’s richest businessmen. He secured a prime swath of riverside real estate in Kinshasa where his family set up a textile business that holds a contract to make the nation’s military uniforms. A perpetual flashy presence, he is known for his extravagance. People still talk about his daughter’s 2019 wedding, which had the aura of a Las Vegas show, with dancers wearing light-up costumes and large white giraffe statues as table centerpieces. He has served on the board of Congo’s central bank and was re-elected this year as president of the country’s powerful trade association, the equivalent of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The huge mining agency where he is chairman was nationalized and renamed under President Mobutu Sese Seko after Congo gained independence from Belgium in 1960. Gécamines once had a monopoly on copper and cobalt mining and, by the 1980s, was among the top copper producers in the world. Jobs there offered a good salary, health care and schooling for employees’ families. But Mobutu, who ruled for 32 years, raided its funds to support himself and his cronies, a pattern followed by his successors, according to anti-corruption groups. By the 1990s, production from Gécamines had declined dramatically. Money wasn’t reinvested into operations, and the agency amassed debt of more than $1 billion. Eventually, half of its work force was laid off. To survive, Gécamines was restructured, turning to joint ventures with private, mostly foreign, investors in which the agency had a minority stake. Mr. Yuma took over in 2010, promising to return Gécamines to its former glory. But instead, according to anti-corruption groups, mining revenues soon disappeared. The Carter Center, a nonprofit, estimated that between 2011 and 2014 alone some $750 million vanished from Gécamines’ coffers, placing the blame in part on Mr. Yuma. ADVERTISEMENT The winners of Gécamines’ partnership deals under Mr. Yuma included Dan Gertler, a billionaire diamond dealer from Israel. Mr. Gertler was later put under U.S. sanctions for “hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of opaque and corrupt mining and oil deals,” according to the Treasury Department. A confidential investigative report that was submitted to the State Department and Treasury and obtained by The Times accuses Mr. Yuma of nepotism, holding stakes in textile and food-importing businesses that got funding from a government agency he helped oversee, and steering work to a mining contractor in which he was alleged to have shares. American authorities also believed that Mr. Yuma was using some of the mining-sector money to help prop up supporters of Joseph Kabila, the kleptocratic president of Congo for 18 years who had first put him in charge of Gécamines. “Suspicious financial transactions appeared to coincide with the country’s electoral cycles,” said the State Department’s 2018 annual report on human rights in Congo, crediting the Carter Center for the research. By his own tally, Mr. Yuma has been accused of cheating Congo out of some $8.8 billion, an amount he thinks is absurd, saying he has brought in billions of dollars in revenue to the country. Mr. Yuma has launched a bombastic counterattack on watchdog groups and his critics, calling them “new colonialists.” He has claimed that they somehow conspired with mining companies to stymie his efforts to revamp the industry, which, in his assessment, has left “the Congolese population in a form of modern slavery.” Mr. Yuma also sent The Times a 33-page document outlining his defense, noting the many “veritable smear campaigns that seek to sully his reputation and blur his major role in favor of the country through the reform of its mining policy.” ADVERTISEMENT The room was packed. Top White House and State Department officials, mining executives, Senate staffers and other Washington elites sat rapt one day in 2018 at the D.C. headquarters of a foreign policy group as the microphone was handed to the guest of honor: Mr. Yuma. “We understand President Donald Trump’s desire to diversify and secure the U.S. supply chain,” he said, speaking to the Atlantic Council. “It would be of our best interests to consider partnerships with American companies to develop projects for the supply of these minerals.” Accused at home of pillaging the country’s revenues, Mr. Yuma had taken his image-cleansing campaign abroad, seeking redemption by convincing Washington that he was a critical link to Congo’s minerals and metals. Mr. Yuma’s team of lobbyists and lawyers included Joseph Szlavik, who had served in the White House under President George Bush, and Erich Ferrari, a prominent sanctions lawyer. Lodging at the Four Seasons, he held meetings on two trips that spring with officials from the World Bank and the Departments of Defense, Energy and the Interior. He also traveled to New York, where he met with Donald Trump Jr. There, he was accompanied by Gentry Beach, a Texas hedge fund manager who was a major campaign fund-raiser for the former president as well as a close friend and erstwhile business partner of the younger Mr. Trump. Mr. Beach has been trying to secure a mining deal in Congo, and was previously invested with Mr. Trump in a mining project there. He did not respond to requests for comment. ADVERTISEMENT “Someone wanted to introduce me to say hello,” Mr. Yuma said, playing down the exchange with the president’s son. Mr. Trump said he did not recall the meeting. Through all the encounters, Mr. Yuma said, he recited the same message: American needed him, and he was ready to help. In Washington, he even offered what he considered crucial intelligence about Russia’s efforts to acquire Congolese niobium, a shiny white metal that resists corrosion and can handle super-high temperatures like those found in fighter jet engines. Mr. Yuma said he had helped thwart the sale to benefit the United States, according to two American officials involved in the meeting. Signs of trouble emerged during one of the trips. A member of his lobbying team was pulled aside by a State Department official and given a stark warning. Mr. Yuma was now a target of a corruption investigation by the United States, and he was about to be punished. A few weeks later, in June 2018, the State Department formally prohibited him from returning to the United States. “Today’s actions send a strong signal that the U.S. government is committed to fighting corruption,” the State Department said in a statement at the time that did not name Mr. Yuma, and instead said the actions involved “several senior” officials from Congo, which The Times confirmed included Mr. Yuma. ADVERTISEMENT For Mr. Yuma, the action signaled that he needed even more muscle. He would hire Herman Cohen, a former assistant secretary of state for African affairs under Mr. Bush, and George Denison, who had worked for President Gerald Ford. A former Congolese airline and telephone executive named Joseph Gatt, who lives in Virginia and is close to Mr. Yuma, also took up his cause. Mr. Gatt stationed a personal aide at the Fairmont, a luxury hotel about a mile from the White House, who organized meetings with the lobbyists to push for permission for Mr. Yuma to visit the United States. “He’s a very formidable person,” Mr. Gatt said of Mr. Yuma in an interview, insisting that the allegations against him were false and that he was “quite clean.” At the same time, Mr. Yuma worked on elevating his standing in Congo. He hatched a plan with the exiting president, Mr. Kabila: Mr. Yuma would act as his proxy by becoming prime minister, State Department officials told The Times. But a top American diplomat was sent to meet with Mr. Yuma at his home in Kinshasa to make clear that the United States strongly objected to the plan, according to an interview with the diplomat, J. Peter Pham. After pulling out a bottle of Cristal Champagne, Mr. Yuma talked with Mr. Pham about political events in Congo, but things soon turned sour. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Pham, then a special envoy to the region, told Mr. Yuma that the Americans were prepared to deport two of his daughters, who were completing graduate degrees in the United States, if he pursued Mr. Kabila’s scheme. “If we revoked your visa, we could revoke theirs,” Mr. Pham recalled telling Mr. Yuma. Mr. Yuma was undeterred, and his team recruited an aide to Representative Hank Johnson, Democrat of Georgia, to deliver an invitation for Mr. Yuma to visit the United States and discuss his work in Congo. The invitation was even shared with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, though the State Department shut it down. “We saw it for what it was: an attempt to get around the visa ban,” Mr. Pham said. Still determined to get his way, Mr. Yuma bolstered his collection of influencers. Mr. Denison briefly joined the Washington lobbying team with instructions to ensure that Mr. Yuma could travel to the United States and that he “not face legal sanctions,” a June 2020 email shows. The United States was considering putting Mr. Yuma on a sanctions list, according to State Department officials, a move that could freeze money he had in international banks. But a $3 million contract between the men did not mention that assignment, instead saying that Mr. Denison was to “promote the attractiveness of the business climate” in Congo, according to a copy of the document. Shortly after he started the work, Mr. Denison received $1.5 million, emails show, with instructions to transfer most of it to an account belonging to an associate of Mr. Yuma’s. The transaction drew scrutiny from the bank — and alarm bells went off for Mr. Denison, who said he was concerned that he might be unknowingly participating in a money-laundering scheme. Mr. Denison hired a lawyer, quit the job and ultimately returned all the funds. “He’s a huge crook,” Mr. Denison said. Mr. Yuma did not respond to a question on the matter. ADVERTISEMENT President Tshisekedi and Mr. Yuma walked near a large terraced canyon at one of Glencore’s cobalt mines in the Copperbelt, a region so defined by mining that roadside markets sell steel-toed boots and hard hats alongside fresh eggs and spears of okra. The outing in May was awkward for these two political rivals. Mr. Tshisekedi, a longtime opposition member who took office in early 2019 in a disputed election, has been fully embraced by the Biden administration, which sees him as an ally in battling global warming. He is chairman of the African Union and has repeatedly appeared with Mr. Biden at international events, including a meeting in Rome last month and then again a few days later in Glasgow at the global climate conference. Back home, Mr. Tshisekedi has announced that he intends to make Congo “the world capital for strategic minerals.” But some Congolese and American officials think that in order for that to happen, Mr. Yuma needs to be ousted. “We have continuously tried to apply pressure” to have Mr. Yuma removed, said one State Department official. Yet Mr. Yuma “retains considerable influence,” the official said, baffling the State Department. Meanwhile, Mr. Yuma is carrying on as usual, trailed by an entourage of aides who address him as President Yuma, as he is known throughout much of Congo for his business leadership. It is also a nod to his power base and ambitions. He talks of installing seven new floors and a helipad at his office building in downtown Kinshasa. He even had one of his lobbyists track down Mr. Tshisekedi in September in New York, during the United Nations General Assembly meeting, to press him to stand by Mr. Yuma. ADVERTISEMENT In Congo, Mr. Yuma also embarked on a nationwide tour this year that looked a lot like a campaign for public office. He set out to visit every province, strategically making his first stop in Mr. Tshisekedi’s hometown, where he met with a group of struggling pineapple juice sellers. Before leaving, he handed the group $5,000 in cash to jump-start their business. “Just to show them that I’m supportive,” he explained in an interview. Like the president, Mr. Yuma is hoping to get credit for attracting more U.S. investors, convinced that his reform efforts will turn the tide. “I’m a friend of America,” he said in the interview. “I always work in good will to protect and to help the U.S. invest in D.R.C. And I told you, I love America. My children were at university there. One of these days, people will understand I’m a real good friend of America and I will continue to help.” If his success depends on transforming the mining sector, the task will be formidable. All day long on a main highway that runs through dozens of industrial mines, trucks groan with loads of copper and tubs of chemicals used to extract metals from ore. But snaking between them is motorcycle after motorcycle, with one man driving and one sitting backward, acting as a lookout, atop huge bags of stolen cobalt.

" PARIS — European countries desperate for a long-term and reliable source of energy to help reach ambitious climate goals are turning to an answer that caused earlier generations to shudder: nuclear power. Poland wants a fleet of smaller nuclear power stations to help end its reliance on coal. Britain is betting on Rolls-Royce to produce cheap modular reactors to complement wind and solar energy. And in France, President Emmanuel Macron plans to build on the nation’s huge nuclear program. As world leaders pledge to avert a climate catastrophe, the nuclear industry sees an opportunity for a revival. Sidelined for years after the disasters at Fukushima and Chernobyl, advocates are wrangling to win recognition of nuclear energy, alongside solar and wind, as an acceptable source of clean power. More than half a dozen European countries recently announced plans to build a new generation of nuclear reactors. Some are smaller and cheaper than older designs, occupying the space of two football fields and costing a fraction of the price of standard nuclear plants. The Biden administration is also backing such technology as a tool of “mass decarbonization” for the United States. ADVERTISEMENT “Nuclear is going mainstream in the climate movement,” said Kirsty Gogan, a member of Britain’s Nuclear Innovation Research and Advisory Board and a founder of TerraPraxis, a nonprofit that supports nuclear energy in the shift to a green economy. “This is a critical decade, and I think we’re going to see real change.” But not everyone is buying the idea that nuclear is a solution to climate change. Ten years ago, a few months after an earthquake and tsunami caused a meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan, which forced the evacuation of over 150,000 people, the German government announced it would gradually shut down its nuclear program. Now Germany is at the head of a group of nations that want to defuse efforts to include more nuclear power in Europe’s green energy mix. They are worried about a proliferation of nuclear plants on European soil, and the radioactive waste they produce. The pushback is creating tensions with France, Europe’s largest nuclear energy producer, which has forged an unusual alliance with Eastern European countries that want to attract more investment for nuclear power, including Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania. ADVERTISEMENT The group is pressing the European Union to classify nuclear energy as a “sustainable” investment, a move that would unlock billions of euros of state aid and investment from pension funds, banks and other investors seeking to put money in environmental causes. Austria, Denmark, Luxembourg and Spain have joined Germany in trying to beat back the initiative in Brussels. The nuclear industry’s main selling point is a technology involving scaled-down plants, or small modular reactors, that supporters say are safe, cheap and efficient. The argument is that wind and solar power alone won’t be enough to help countries meet the goals outlined at the United Nations climate summit this month in Glasgow. Nearly 200 countries at the conference pledged new efforts to prevent Earth from heating more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, compared with preindustrial levels. Past that threshold, the risk of deadly heat waves and storms, water scarcity and ecosystem collapse escalates immensely, scientists warn. But countries are falling far short even as they step up investments in wind and solar power, whose output varies with the elements. The reopening of the global economy from the coronavirus pandemic caused a recent spike in energy prices and set European governments scrambling to secure alternative supplies of power. Nuclear advocates say that experience shows the need for a new generation of nuclear power. “Nuclear has a really important role to play in getting to net zero for many countries,” said Tom Samson, chief executive of Rolls-Royce SMR, which has been working for six years on a commercial small modular nuclear reactor design — and feels its moment has arrived. Rolls-Royce, which announced the venture this month, is jumping into a multibillion-dollar market for small nuclear reactors, competing with companies like NuScale, GE Hitachi and TerraPower (which has Bill Gates as its chairman) in the United States; Électricité de France, the French state-owned power company; China’s National Nuclear Corporation; and KEPCO in South Korea. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Samson pitches the venture as a new approach to an industry notorious for delays and cost overruns, and mostly avoided by investors. Rolls-Royce, which makes jet engines and supplies the power plant for the Royal Navy’s nuclear submarine fleet, hopes to build 16 of the plants in Britain and generate export sales as well. The cookie-cutter components will be factory-built and transportable by truck or ship. Initially the plants are expected to cost 2.2 billion pounds ($3 billion) each, compared with an estimated £22.5 billion price tag for a full-size plant now under construction in western England. Drawings of the Rolls-Royce reactor show a compact, futuristic building in a verdant landscape. One reactor would have roughly one-seventh the output of the largest modern nuclear stations, and could power one million homes. Labor unions in Britain and Europe back the initiatives, arguing that nuclear plants generate jobs and are preferable to renewable technologies like a solar field, which don’t require many workers to maintain. Critics say nuclear power is hardly a solution for accelerating the push to net-zero emissions. For one thing, new nuclear stations, even small ones, will take up to a decade or more to come online, in part because of regulatory requirements, nowhere near fast enough to address a climate emergency. The first Rolls-Royce reactor wouldn’t be in operation until 2031. And safety questions have lingered after high-profile nuclear accidents, along with unresolved concerns over the storage of radioactive waste. ADVERTISEMENT Croatia is opposing a nuclear reactor project in Slovenia that would deposit some nuclear waste near their border. Germany is objecting to a planned Polish reactor that the German Green party said would most likely contaminate Germany in the event of an accident. The ability of small nuclear reactors to produce energy quickly or cheaply enough to matter for countries is also unclear, said Mark Hibbs, a senior fellow and a nuclear expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Mr. Hibbs, who is based in Germany, noted that 10 such reactors might be required to do the same job as one large modern nuclear power station. Doug Parr, chief scientist for Greenpeace in Britain, said: “It doesn’t solve the problems for society; it solves the problems for the nuclear industry.” He added, “They want to come up with a new concept that does not have the bad image of large nuclear.” Those pushing for a nuclear revival say such concerns are overblown. In France, President Macron this month announced he would reboot the nation’s atomic program to “live up to” France’s commitments to slash carbon emissions. A recent government-commissioned report concluded France probably can’t achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 with only renewable energy. His government is expected to authorize state-owned Électricité de France to build six new pressurized reactors, and spend billions to help EDF produce small modular nuclear reactors by 2030. The work would be a lifeline for EDF, which is over 40 billion euros ($45 billion) in debt after contending with nuclear plant construction delays and cost overruns. In Eastern Europe, the rush is already underway. Poland, Romania and Ukraine, long reliant on coal-burning power plants, are among those signing contracts with American and European companies for small-reactor technology. Poland alone plans to build large nuclear reactors and at least half a dozen small ones at coal sites to produce power and create jobs. “The ability to bring new electric power generation in a shorter time frame and with a lower total project cost is a primary driver,” said John Kotek, vice president for policy development and public affairs at the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry group in Washington. ADVERTISEMENT Still, Europe’s divide over nuclear power remains sharp enough that policymakers may not be ready to support a nuclear buildup program — even if they sorely want to achieve climate change targets. “It would be impossible to build any consensus policy in Brussels that would strongly support member states’ investment in nuclear power,” said Mr. Hibbs of the Carnegie Endowment. “It would be left up to the national governments to do that.” But as investors look at where to deploy trillions of dollars in assets in the shift away from fossil fuels, nuclear power is becoming harder to ignore. “The general consensus in climate circles is nuclear is a clean energy source,” said Marisa Drew, chief sustainability officer at Credit Suisse. “If someone can deliver something that is economically viable and scalable and truly green, and do it in a safe way,” she said, “then we have to embrace that.” Liz Alderman reported from Paris and Stanley Reed from London."
" When a wildfire plows through a forest, life underground changes, too. Death comes for many microorganisms. But, like trees, some microbes are adapted to fire. Certain fungi are known as pyrophilous, or “fire-loving.” After a fire, pyrophilous fungi “show up from nowhere, basically,” said Tom Bruns, a mycologist at the University of California, Berkeley, even in areas that haven’t burned for decades. Some sprout in fiery shades of orange and pink. “It’s a worldwide phenomenon, but we don’t really know much about them,” he said. A new study, published last month in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology, aimed to uncover the food source that allows Pyronema, a genus of pyrophilous fungi, to appear so quickly in such big numbers after a fire. What they discovered is that the damage left by the fire itself may allow the fungi to thrive. That could affect how the ecosystem recovers, as well as how much carbon gets released into the atmosphere after wildfires. During a severe wildfire, a lot of carbon in the top layer of soil goes into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, while some of it stays put as charcoal, or what scientists call pyrolyzed organic matter. Slightly deeper in the soil, it’s less hot — but hot enough that any living microbes and insects exploded and died, said the study’s lead author, Monika Fischer, a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Berkeley. ADVERTISEMENT So, is Pyronema just living off this layer of death? “Or can Pyronema actually eat charcoal?” Dr. Fischer said. Charcoal is difficult for many organisms to break down, said Thea Whitman, an associate professor of soil ecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Dr. Fischer’s co-author. But, she said, “there are certain microbes that can decompose it.” To find out if Pyronema can eat charcoal, the authors grew the fungus from samples collected by Dr. Bruns’s team after the Rim fire in California in 2013. The Pyronema lived on charcoal, as well as three other nutrient sources for comparison. Then they dunked the fungus in liquid nitrogen and sent it off for RNA sequencing. “If it’s trying to eat the charcoal, we would see a bunch of metabolic genes getting turned on — which is what we saw,” Dr. Fischer said. And many were genes involved in breaking down the complex ring structures that make up charcoal. ADVERTISEMENT To confirm that the fungus was actually doing what it appeared to be doing, Dr. Whitman’s lab grew pine seedlings in an atmosphere with carbon dioxide containing carbon-13, an isotope whose unusual weight makes it easy to trace, and then put the trees in a specialized furnace to form charcoal, which was fed to the Pyronema. Like us, fungi take in oxygen and expel carbon dioxide, most of which comes from whatever they are eating. The fungus’s carbon-13-labeled emissions, then, suggested that it really was snacking on charcoal. The researchers also tracked normal carbon dioxide coming out of the fungus, and substantially more of it than the charcoal, suggesting it was eating something else — maybe the agar it was growing on, or some carbon that entered during inoculation, Dr. Whitman said. Dr. Fischer offered this interpretation: “Pyronema can eat charcoal, but it really doesn’t like to.” The fungi may first enjoy that layer of dead organisms, the authors suggested, and then switch to charcoal when it must. “Fungi are amazing at degrading all sorts of compounds,” said Kathleen Treseder, an ecologist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study. “It makes sense that they would be able to break down this pyrolyzed material.” Aditi Sengupta, a soil microbial ecologist at California Lutheran University who also was not involved, added that it would be useful to confirm the experiment outside the lab and in the wild. If this fungus is breaking down charcoal after a fire, Dr. Fischer said — even a little bit of it — then that could help open up a food source for the next generation of microbes and other creatures that can’t eat charcoal, making Pyronema an important player in post-fire recovery. And if Pyronema can do it, she said, maybe other fungi can, too. “We want these kinds of activities in the soil,” Dr. Sengupta said. At the same time, she pointed out that “eventually that might lead to us losing the carbon in the soil.” As climate change and other human actions drive more frequent and intense wildfires, we need to understand whether carbon stored in the ground as charcoal will stay there, Dr. Treseder said, “or if that’s not something we can really count on, because the fungus can degrade it and release it as CO2.”"
" Arctic. Atlantic. Long ago, the two oceans existed in harmony, with warm and salty Atlantic waters gently flowing into the Arctic. The layered nature of the Arctic — sea ice on top, cool freshwater in the middle and warm, salty water at the bottom — helped hold the boundary between the polar ocean and the warmer Atlantic. But everything changed when the larger ocean began flowing faster than the polar ocean could accommodate, weakening the distinction between the layers and transforming Arctic waters into something closer to the Atlantic. This process, called Atlantification, is part of the reason the Arctic is warming faster than any other ocean. “It’s not a new invasion of the Arctic,” said Yueng-Djern Lenn, a physical oceanographer at Bangor University in Wales. “What’s new is that the properties of the Arctic are changing.” Satellites offer some of the clearest measurements of changes in the Arctic Ocean and sea ice. But their records only go back around 40 years, obscuring how the climate of the ocean may have changed in prior decades. ADVERTISEMENT “To go back, we need a sort of time machine,” said Tommaso Tesi, a researcher at the Institute of Polar Sciences-CNR, Italy. In a paper published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, Dr. Tesi and colleagues were able to turn back time with yard-long sediment cores taken from the seafloor, which archived 800 years of historical changes in Arctic waters. Their analysis found Atlantification started at the beginning of the 20th century — decades before the process had been documented by satellite imagery. The Arctic has warmed by around 2 degrees Celsius since 1900. But this early Atlantification did not appear in existing historical climate models, a discrepancy that the authors say may reveal gaps in those estimates. “It’s a bit unsettling because we rely on these models for future climate predictions,” Dr. Tesi said. Mohamed Ezat, a researcher at the Tromso campus of the Arctic University of Norway, who was not involved with the research, called the findings “remarkable.” “Information on long-term past changes in Arctic Ocean hydrography are needed, and long overdue,” Dr. Ezat wrote in an email. ADVERTISEMENT In 2017, the researchers extracted a sediment core from the seafloor of Kongsfjorden, a glacial fjord in the east end of the Fram Strait, a gateway between the Norwegian archipelago Svalbard and Greenland, where Arctic and Atlantic waters mingle. The researchers sliced up the core at regular intervals and dried those layers. Then came the painstaking process of sifting out and identifying the samples’ foraminifera — single-celled organisms that build intricate shells around themselves using minerals in the ocean. When foraminifera die, their shells drift to the seafloor and accumulate in layers of sediment. The creatures are crucial clues in sediment samples; by identifying which foraminifera are present in a sample and analyzing the chemistry of their shells, scientists can glean the properties of past oceans. The team’s original idea was to reconstruct the oceanographic conditions of a region that contained both Arctic and Atlantic waters, going back 1,000 to 2,000 years. But, in the slices of the core dating back to the early 20th century, the researchers noticed a sudden, massive increase in the concentration of foraminifera that prefer salty environments — a sign of Atlantification, far earlier than anyone had documented. “It was quite a lot of surprises in one study,” said Francesco Muschitiello, an oceanographer at the University of Cambridge and an author on the paper. The sheer amount of sediment was so high that the researchers could assemble a chronology of past climate down to five- or 10-year increments. Additionally, a molecular biomarker could pinpoint a specific year, 1916, when coal mining began in Kongsfjorden. Since the foraminiferal shift occurred just before this marker, the researchers estimate Atlantification began around 1907, give or take a decade. ADVERTISEMENT When the researchers compared the data from their paleoclimate model with others to see if they overlapped, they found existing climate models had no sign of this early Atlantification. The researchers suggest a number of possible reasons behind this absence, such as an underestimation of the role of freshwater mixing in the Arctic or the region’s sensitivity to warming. Dr. Lenn, who was not involved with the research, sees a difference between this early Atlantification and the present, rapid Atlantification, which is largely driven by melting Arctic sea ice. “It’s too soon after the start of the industrial revolution for us to have accumulated excess heat in the planetary system for it to be anthropogenic at that point,” Dr. Lenn said. The authors are not sure of the precise reasons behind the early Atlantification. If human influences are the cause, then “the whole system is much more sensitive to greenhouse gases than we previously thought,” Dr. Muschitiello said. In another possibility, earlier natural warming may have made the Arctic Ocean much more sensitive to the accelerated Atlantification of recent decades. “Could it be that we destabilized a system that was already shifting?” Dr. Tesi said. This is the maddening mystery of any paleoclimate model. “None of us were there,” Dr. Lenn said, laughing. Although this is true of humans, it is not true of corals in the Fram Strait. The long-lived animals record changes in climate and other parameters, making them excellent sentinels of climate history. Dr. Tesi hopes to study the strait’s cold-living corals next, to see what insight they may offer into the Atlantic’s usurpation of the Arctic."
" For two weeks the Iranian government tolerated growing protests over scarce water supplies in the central Iranian city of Isfahan, watching them grow as restaurants served demonstrators free soup and barbers offered free haircuts. State television even aired interviews with farmers discussing their grievances. But after the protests spilled over to at least one other city, the predictable happened on Friday: The government violently cracked down. Security forces wielding batons, shields and guns swarmed the city’s riverbed around 4 a.m. Thursday as a group of farmers were sipping tea and chatting about protest strategy around a campfire. The security forces had used a megaphone to tell farmers they had 10 minutes to evacuate, Hassan Tavakoli, a 47-year-old farmer from Isfahan, said in a telephone interview. His account was backed up by several videos that were shared with The New York Times by Isfahan residents. ADVERTISEMENT “Before we had a chance to move, suddenly our tents were set on fire and they started throwing tear gas at us and shooting in the air,” Mr. Tavakoli said. He said the crowd included several families with young children and two babies. “I never expected them to do this to us, to beat us, fire at us and injure farmers,” he added. For more than two weeks, Mr. Tavakoli and hundreds of other farmers had been protesting on the dry bed of the city’s storied Zayanderoud River. Tens of thousands of people had joined them in a show of solidarity. Their demand: Restore water flows to the river to help irrigate farmlands laid to waste from years of mismanaging water resources. “We have nothing left of our lands and livelihoods, we are just asking for our water rights,” said Mr. Tavakoli. He owns three hectares of farmland that was once lush with crops of wheat, barley, and vegetables. The land has been dry and barren for 15 months, forcing Mr. Tavakoli to sell his livestock to survive. Iran has been facing increasing water scarcity issues because of years of mismanagement. In the case of Isfahan, water has been diverted through underground pipes away from farmlands and toward industrial complexes in the desert province of Yazd and for drinking water to the religious city of Qom. ADVERTISEMENT Iran Meteorological Organization estimates that some 97 percent of the country is dealing with drought at some level. The country’s former energy minister warned in May that Iran was facing its driest summer in 50 years and that temperatures approaching 50 degrees Celsius — 122 degrees Fahrenheit — would lead to cuts in electricity power and shortages of water. Protests in July over water shortages, mostly staged by farmers from the ethnic Arab population in Khuzestan Province, were also violently crushed by the government. As a temporary solution, officials opened a dam, and water flowed back to the river, helping irrigate the farmers’ land and hydrate livestock. In Thursday’s crackdown, security forces demanded the farmers issue a statement announcing their sit-in had ended even though no resolution had been reached and the government had not taken steps to address their concerns, Mr. Tavakoli said. On Friday, as people gathered to protest, security forces lashed out with more violence. Clashes spread from the dry riverbed to streets in downtown Isfahan. Security guards fired birdshot and tear gas at the crowds of protesters and beat them with batons, according to two eyewitnesses in the area and videos shared widely on social media. There were no official casualty numbers, but videos and eyewitnesses said scores of demonstrators were injured. Mr. Tavakoli said dozens of farmers were also badly injured in the clashes, but he had not heard of any reports of deaths. Rights activists said dozens of people were arrested. Videos on social media showed a woman clad in a black chador bleeding from the nose; a middle-aged man with blood running down his face from a bruised swollen eye; and a man’s bare back riddled with red spots, apparently from birdshot. Some videos showed protesters throwing stones at anti-riot police and chanting “shame on you” and “death to the Dictator” and “death to Khamenei,” targeting Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the last word in all key state and security matters. ADVERTISEMENT Mobile and internet service was disrupted in Isfahan and Khuzestan, residents reported, as they government sought to cut off communication and organizing. Experts on Iran’s water scarcity issues say climate change and reduced rainfall have exacerbated the drought caused by mismanagement. “This is water bankruptcy, there are lots of water right holders but not enough water in the accounts,” said Kaveh Madani, a world renown water expert and former deputy head of Iran’s environment agency. “People upstream and downstream of Zayanderoud are asking for water for all. But this is mission impossible.” The Zayanderoud River snakes through the historic city of Isfahan. Its leafy riverbanks are the city’s main green space, and families gather on summer evenings for picnics. In the fall, the river serves as a stop for migratory birds flocking south."

" BERLIN — In the middle of Germany’s election campaign, almost 200 people died in extreme floods in Germany. Four months later, the fight against climate change has become the central theme of the new post-Merkel government. Most roofs will be fitted with solar panels and more than 1,000 windmills will be built, almost doubling the share of renewable sources for electricity to 80 percent by 2030. The last coal mine will close the same year, eight years earlier than planned. And 15 million electric cars will roam the country’s fabled Autobahn. At least that is the ambition of what Olaf Scholz, the designated next chancellor, says will be the “biggest industrial modernization of Germany in more than 100 years.” It was part of the governing plan he and his coalition partners announced on Wednesday. Who will pay for it all is another question — and one that was hotly debated by the very different parties who have joined Mr. Scholz’s Social Democrats, the progressive Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats. ADVERTISEMENT The Greens campaigned to spend 50 billion euros in green investments each year for a decade to bankroll the country’s transition to renewable energy — and pay for it by scrapping the country’s strict balanced budget rule. The Free Democrats agreed to join the government only on condition of not raising any taxes and upholding the country’s balanced budget law, a so-called debt brake enshrined in its Constitution. It was not by coincidence that the biggest battle in the six weeks of talks to form a coalition was who would control the finance ministry and with it the purse strings. Both Robert Habeck, co-leader of the Greens, and Christian Lindner, leader of the Free Democrats, wanted the job and fought for it until the end. Ultimately, Mr. Lindner won, while Mr. Habeck will oversee a new super-ministry of economy and climate. ADVERTISEMENT “Regarding finance: It’s no secret that the positions in the coalition are far apart,” Mr. Habeck of the Greens told Süddeutsche Zeitung in an interview published Thursday. “We spoke intensely about taxes, cutting subsidies and market regulation. If you ask me where I would have liked to see more, it’s this area.” One of the biggest questions for climate change experts is whether the commitment to put Germany — Europe’s biggest economy — on a path to carbon neutrality by 2045 is still an issue primarily pushed by the Greens or is now truly a project shared by all members of the new administration. “Will its achievements match the ambitions, or will the parties fall back to ideological starting points?” said Lutz Weischer, who heads the Berlin-based office of Germanwatch, an environmental watchdog. There are some hopeful signs, he said. By turning the green transition into a national project of industrial competitiveness and social justice, each of the three parties has been able to sell it to their base. The new government has woven the commitment to put in place measures that would limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, as stipulated by the Paris climate agreement, throughout its 177-page governing deal. There are 198 mentions of “climate” in that document, in all policy areas from culture to foreign policy. “The climate crisis endangers our livelihood and threatens freedom, prosperity and security,” the preamble of the coalition treaty states. “Reaching the climate goals of Paris is our top priority. We want to reinvent our social market economy as a social-ecological market economy.” Even Mr. Lindner, the leader of the libertarian Free Democrats, proudly called the treaty “the most ambitious climate protection program of any industrialized nation.” ADVERTISEMENT “If that really is the spirit of the new government, then it is a real game changer,” Mr. Weischer said. “But it remains to be seen.” Germany’s debt brake, which was written into the Constitution in 2009, restricts annual borrowing to 0.35 percent of the nominal gross domestic product, amounting to roughly 12 billion euros a year, a far cry from the 50 billion the Greens say is needed. But there are signs that the new government has found some back-door solutions to borrowing. One is to exploit the temporary suspension of the debt brake during the pandemic. As finance minister, Mr. Scholz last year suspended the spending limit, which is allowed under a national emergency, and the coalition treaty says it will not be reinstated until the end of 2022. That gives the new government time to borrow money and put it in a fund that will continue to run even after the limit on borrowing comes back into force. Another way to raise money is to beef up the state development bank, known as KfW, which can borrow funds that the government can then earmark for infrastructure projects and other investments — without it appearing on the federal budget. There are also ways to tweak the formula according to how the debt brake is calculated and raise the spending limit that way, economists said. ADVERTISEMENT Few expect that this creative accounting will be enough to raise the 50 billion euros per year the Greens had lobbied for, but the commitment to a significant increase in public investment was broadly applauded. “I think this agreement signals a change,” said Clemens Fuest, president of the Ifo economic institute. “A lot of transformation investments are really being pushed harder now.” Marcel Fratzscher, head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said he was impressed with the detail in the proposed measures. “There is a wind of change in the air,” Mr. Fratzscher said. “On climate, it is very ambitious, very detailed and very convincing program. Whether it’s enough to make Germany compliant with the 1.5 degree target is to be seen.” Environmental organizations and climate activists were not convinced. “This coalition agreement alone is not enough to ensure the 1.5 degree limit,” the Fridays for Future youth movement said in a statement. According to Greenpeace, the program “only hints at a radical ecological breakthrough.” Mr. Habeck, the future economy and climate minister, acknowledged the difficulties ahead. “No other country in Europe is doing what we’re doing,” Mr. Habeck said. “Our neighbors either hold on to coal, like Poland, or bet on nuclear energy, like France, or they’re doing both and a little bit of renewable energy. We are leaving behind both old technologies.” “There will be decisions that will be difficult,” he added. “I know that.”"
" If you think what climate change portends for America is scary, wait until you hear about Australia. That’s the gist of “Burning,” which focuses on that country’s sadly familiar experiences with warming temperatures: terrifying wildfires, drill-baby-drill politicians, and activists desperately trying to save us all by pointing out the facts about the future. The big difference is that Australia’s fires are the biggest: Over 50 million acres burned during its so-called “Black Summer” (2019-20), dwarfing losses in California or the Amazon. The director, Eva Orner (“Chasing Asylum”), makes her contribution to documentaries on climate change by sticking to Australia and underlining the visceral impact on Australians. It’s hellish: red skies and dark days, fear and helplessness, pregnancy complications and death. Orner’s flood of talking heads and footage from the field (including beleaguered locals and sickly koalas) settles into a drumbeat of worry — justified, obviously, but numbing. The film also suffers by comparison with a more complex and stimulating look at climate change, Lucy Walker’s alarming “Bring Your Own Brigade.” But the young activist Daisy Jeffrey does provide this film with a smart rebel leader, versus Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, and his coal-friendly politicking. ADVERTISEMENT Like many environmental docs, Orner holds up a possible savior (a tech billionaire pitching a pivot to renewables) and a prelapsarian vision (the Aboriginal stewardship of the land before European arrival). Her film is ultimately another in a series of distress signals for the world, with the hope that Australia doesn’t become a continent-sized Cassandra. Burning

The truck brings everything and the kitchen sink, with outdoorsy options such as a rooftop tent and a track-mounted Camp Kitchen, which lets owners whip up a trail-side omelet and wash up afterward. And after its hot-starting initial public offering, Rivian is already valued at nearly $100 billion, more than such behemoths as Ford Motor and General Motors. All good so far, for the company’s fingers-crossed shareholders, stakeholders (including Amazon and Ford) and 9,500 employees. Some consumers may still have a question: What in the world is a Rivian? The R1T, now emerging from a former Mitsubishi factory in Illinois, must navigate that awkward getting-to-know-you stage, just as a then-obscure Tesla did with its Roadster in 2008 and Model S in 2012. Unlike Tesla, which created the electric vehicle market and once had it mostly to itself, Rivian faces immediate competition from G.M.’s 1,000-horsepower GMC Hummer EV pickup, and from a Ford F-150 Lightning — based on America’s best-selling vehicle for 39 straight years — set to arrive in spring. Tesla has pushed Texas production of its outré Cybertruck to sometime in 2022. Rivian, based in Irvine, Calif., took 12 years to get to market, but its timing appears ideal. Pickup trucks continued to strong-arm market share as the pandemic hammered sales of traditional cars. A residential flight from big cities, such as New York’s exodus upstate, may have played a role. (Home project, meet pickup truck.) One in five vehicles sold in America is now a full- or midsize pickup, or well over three million sales in a normal year. ADVERTISEMENT Where Ford’s Lightning appears to be a more conventional, task-oriented truck, the 16-inch-shorter Rivian is a born adventurer. A pioneer, too, proof that an electric four-by-four can tackle the most forbidding backcountry. This summer, an R1T successfully navigated the TransAmerica Trail, a roughly 5,000-mile crucible from North Carolina to the Oregon coast. If most buyers are content with only a dirt road to a cabin or campground,  they can always dream. Starting at $68,575, the Rivian becomes the market’s first E.V. to integrate four independent electric motors, each spinning at up to 18,500 r.p.m. That allows all manner of “torque vectoring” tricks, apportioning real-time power to any of four wheels to maximize performance. All while barely making a sound. “Tread lightly” is the mantra of any conscientious off-roader, and the Rivian eliminates a noisy internal combustion engine and its tailpipe spew.  “You can hear the stream trickling when you come down the trail — and the birds,” said Brian Gase, Rivian’s director of special projects. ADVERTISEMENT Yet little will stand in the way of the R1T or its sport utility offshoot, the R1S. An adjustable air suspension and four off-road modes — Auto, Rock, Rally and Drift — allow up to 15 inches of ground clearance. That’s a stunning 4.2 inches more than a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon, a touchstone of overland ability. Move to city-slicker surfaces and this 835-horsepower beast will outrun or dance around any petroleum pickup I’ve tested, claiming a 3.0-second dash to 60 miles an hour. That’s despite a curb weight of nearly 7,150 pounds, about a ton more than a typical full-size gasoline pickup. This truck doesn’t defy physics so much as stage an open revolt. The Rivian never feels quite that quick, and auto publications are finding 3.5 seconds to 60 m.p.h. is more like it. Even that is ridiculous acceleration for any bona fide four-by-four, let alone one that weighs as much as two BMW 330i sedans, and could tow three Bimmers at highway speed. Like most whispery E.V.s, the Rivian plays tricks with one’s somatic system. Without aural cues and frenzied pistons, a more-reliable calculus for forward progress is to watch small cars turn to smaller specks in the mirror. On hilly roads girdling New York’s reservoirs, the Rivian carved up those BMWs and Benzes as if they were holiday turkeys, its clever hydraulic anti-roll system keeping the truck’s body as flat as a platter. A roughly 135-kilowatt-hour battery pack, shielded by composite underbody armor, provides up to 314 miles of range, as rated by the Environmental Protection Agency — reasonable, considering all that mass and drag. Switching into Conserve mode lowers the ride height and operates front-axle motors alone to save juice. For an extra $10,000, a roughly 180-kilowatt-hour battery extends range past 400 miles. That bests the $112,595 Hummer EV, which should manage about 350 miles with its roughly 200-kilowatt-hour pack, the largest ever fitted to an electric vehicle. Rivian also plans to offer a more affordable 105-kilowatt-hour pack with a roughly 230-mile range. The R1T’s brake pedal feels a bit squishy for my firmer tastes, but there’s no denying the truck’s awesome ability to shed speed. In objective testing, Edmunds.com found the Rivian set lofty new pickup records for stopping distance, acceleration and road-holding grip. Less-hurried owners can drive for hours or even days without ever brushing that brake pedal: A smartly chosen, driver-adjustable regenerative function allows effortless “one-pedal” driving to smoothly halt the truck by lifting off the accelerator. ADVERTISEMENT For all its crushing strength, the Rivian is a cutie. Today’s pickup vogue, embodied by the Hummer or Cybertruck, is to resemble a Mechagodzilla, all stomping, fire-breathing menace. The Rivian’s oval, translucent LED eyes, clean lines and cheerful mien are more Iron Giant: rated for all ages, genders and personalities, not just Costco cosplayers in trucker hats. The interior takes a safe path with the Apple-esque minimalism that is in vogue for E.V.s. A mite longer than midsize trucks, much shorter than full-sizers, the R1T offers a back seat comfortable for two or three adults. Most traditional switch gear is shorn in favor of controls on a 16-inch center touch screen, not always for the better. Company representatives believe the cloud-based navigation system will handle directional tasks, and an 18-speaker Meridian audio system will play nicely with onboard apps such as Spotify, or link smartphones via Bluetooth. But the lack of available Apple CarPlay and Android Auto — standard fare on most budget cars — may demand a course correction. Yet design, materials (including vegan leather and genuine ash wood) and craftsmanship are convincingly luxurious. And ingenuity rules. A portable Bluetooth speaker detaches from the center console, ready for campfire singalongs, with a 1,000-lumen flashlight in the driver’s door. USB ports and 110-volt outlets are sprinkled through the cabin and cargo bed. That bed features an electric tailgate, and an optional air compressor to “air down” tires for off-road exploration and refill them for the ride home. There’s no need to pack light: A big storage “frunk” rests below the hood and another beneath the 4.5-foot cargo bed, with a drain plug to double as an ice chest for tailgating. The so-called Gear Tunnel will bore into outdoorsy hearts. This door-to-door abdominal cavity behind the passenger cab, made feasible by the lack of an internal-combustion drive shaft, swallows cargo or extras such as the optional, $5,000 Camp Kitchen. That à la carte item is not cheap. But unfurled from the Rivian, the industry-first unit will stop traffic at any tailgate bash or bonfire, with a two-burner convection cooktop, a collapsible sink with spray faucet and water tank, and a 30-piece Snow Peak kitchen set. Now all Rivian needs to do is cook up sales. Like a baby Tesla, the company expects to burn through a few billion dollars before it can generate positive returns. Amazon owns a 20 percent stake — currently worth about $20 billion, more than five times its original investment — and has ordered 100,000 last-mile Rivian delivery vans through 2030. We will see if such fleet vans become Rivian’s side hustle or the main job. ADVERTISEMENT Whichever electric truck early adopters prefer, one had best get a place in line. Ford says it has 160,000 customer reservations for its Lightning, but expects to build just 15,000 next year before rapidly expanding production. Rivian, in a federal filing, cited a backlog of 55,400 orders for the R1T and R1S. Ford lowballed the Lightning’s starting price at roughly $42,000, but for a work version with a modest 230-mile range. Good luck finding one at dealers. A higher-volume Lightning XLT will start closer to $55,000, with a loaded Platinum edition brushing $90,000. Ford (along with G.M.) touts massive scale, dealership networks and manufacturing experience, albeit in fossil-fueled trucks. Like Tesla, Rivian plans to forgo traditional showrooms in favor of direct sales in all 50 states. The company plans to open dozens of service centers in North America, but is also banking on remote diagnostics, over-the-air updates and mobile technicians who can service Rivians at homes, even when owners are away. Either way, Ford can win: It owns 12 percent of Rivian, though it just dropped a plan to develop an E.V. in partnership with Rivian. Founded by R.J. Scaringe, Rivian hopes to fulfill its existing orders by the end of 2023, from a factory that can build 150,000 units a year. Whatever else happens, Rivian can claim to be first mover in the electric truck space. From this electric David, the R1T lands an impressive first shot. Let’s see what the Goliaths do when they get off the mat."
" We’re also covering biodiversity collapse, the biggest climate legislation in United States history, how traffic roundabouts fight climate change, and more. By Dionne Searcey Demand for electric vehicles, a vital part of the push against climate change, is causing a global scramble for cobalt. The metal is crucial to electric-car batteries, helping them run longer without a charge. The focus of that scramble is the Democratic Republic of Congo, where about two-thirds of the world’s cobalt is produced. To see what that means for the Congolese and for the fight against global warming, I teamed up with my Times colleagues Michael Forsythe and Eric Lipton. Our investigation showed how the quest for Congo’s cobalt, led by China and the United States, is caught in a familiar cycle of exploitation, greed and gamesmanship that often puts narrow national aspirations above all else. ADVERTISEMENT Please read our investigation, which includes stunning photographs by Ashley Gilbertson. And check out these related articles: Congo has been a critical source of strategic minerals for the United States since at least World War II. As a clean energy revolution displaces oil and gas, countries like Congo are stepping into roles once played by Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich nations. The world’s largest supply of cobalt is now controlled by Chinese companies. Here’s how the United States lost out. By Catrin Einhorn At first glance, my article this week about the vaquita porpoise has nothing to do with climate change. It’s about that other environmental crisis: biodiversity collapse. But, at the heart of both is the same dynamic: people using natural resources unsustainably. In the case of the vaquitas, that means fishermen in the wrong place with the wrong gear. The mammals, which only live in the Gulf of California, drown in illegal nets meant for shrimp and fish. Their population has plummeted year after year. Following their story is like witnessing an extinction in plain sight. But scientists say it’s not too late, if only Mexican officials can stop illegal fishing and provide viable alternatives for local fishermen. Read more in my story with the photojournalist Fred Ramos. Numbers: The vaquita population has plummeted from an estimated 600 individuals in 1997 to around 10 in 2019. But, they still have a chance.

Here, from the Climate Fwd: archives, are 10 resources you can use when that cousin you rarely see says it’s all a hoax. Is a flight to visit your family bad for the planet? Farah Stockman, a member of the Times editorial board, dives into the question. By Coral Davenport The United States on Friday took a major step forward in the fight against climate change with passage through the House of Representatives of a $2.2 trillion spending bill that includes the largest expenditures ever made by the federal government to slow global warming. ADVERTISEMENT The legislation provides $555 billion for programs that could significantly curb the fossil fuel emissions that have been heating the atmosphere, fueling deadly and record-breaking wildfires, floods, heat waves and drought. On its own, the legislation isn’t enough to fulfill President Biden’s pledge that the United States will cut its emissions by half from 2005 levels by the end of this decade. But it goes well beyond any other climate policy that has come before it, in the United States and in most other countries. The potential impact: Once enacted, the new legislation could prevent emissions of about one billion tons of carbon dioxide by 2030, according to an analysis by Rhodium Group, an independent research organization. That’s the equivalent of taking roughly all the cars in the United States off the road for one year. What’s next: The bill faces an uncertain path through the Senate, and negotiations between the two chambers could change its form. ADVERTISEMENT A new federal disaster aid program allows Morgan Stanley to front money for recovery and then get paid back, with interest, by taxpayers. After a summer of deadly heat and uncontrolled wildfires, British Columbia was hit by record rainfall. Brazil has committed to end illegal deforestation in eight years, but a government report raises questions about the country’s intent and ability to meet that target. Hotter summer days will mean more Sierra Nevada wildfires, a new study has found. By Cara Buckley There’s a scene in the 1985 slapstick comedy “National Lampoon’s European Vacation” where the hapless Clark Griswold, played by Chevy Chase, gets stuck in a traffic circle in Central London and can’t figure his way out. “Hey look kids, there’s Big Ben, and there’s Parliament,” he says excitedly, before repeating the line, over and over, as he keeps driving around, unable to exit. This broadly reflects American sentiment about roundabouts: They’re confusing and don’t belong on this side of the pond. But traffic engineers say such resistance is short sighted. Not only do modern roundabouts (which differ in size and design from rotaries and large traffic circles) drastically cut traffic injuries and deaths, but, because traffic flows through them without the stop-and-go of red lights, they’re linked to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Also, because roundabouts don’t require lights, they function when the power cuts out after storms. As I wrote this weekend, no American city knows this better than Carmel, Ind., an affluent suburb of Indianapolis and the roundabout capital of America. Carmel is home to 140 roundabouts and counting, and has just a dozen or so four-way stoplights left. Jim Brainard, the seven-term Republican mayor who’s responsible for the city’s roundabout building spree, installed them for largely safety reasons, but says the carbon savings are an added plus. Studies of emissions at roundabouts vary by location and time of day, but federal highway officials say the reduction can be significant, and a former city engineer for Carmel estimates each roundabout saves 20,000 gallons of gas a year. There are about 7,900 roundabouts in the U.S., and though hundreds more are built every year, many traffic engineers would like to see far more.

" Maya Lin’s acclaimed “Ghost Forest” — her installation at Madison Square Park in New York — was being carved up, and the artist couldn’t have been happier: A group of teenagers had seen the harvesting of the wood on Nov. 19 and were sawing it on Monday, to make boats they plan to sail next year. “I was overjoyed, because otherwise the trees were going to be mulched or turned into shingles,” Lin said in an interview. “The boats are engaging and part of a new life for the artwork.” Lin had planted 49 trees last spring for the exhibition, which opened in May and drew crowds and critical acclaim with its haunting evocation of environmental apocalypse. The trees, Atlantic white cedars, came from a dying grove that was slated to be cleared as part of a restoration project in the Pine Barrens in New Jersey, where climate change has caused a large swath of forest to die, and with the installation Lin was making a statement about climate change and environmental sustainability. Lin knew she wanted to save a portion of each log for future projects, including an outdoor arrangement in Colorado and a virtual work that will coincide with the anniversary of the installation next year. But it was unclear where the rest of the wood would go. ADVERTISEMENT By Monday, remnants of the artwork were on the chopping block of a Bronx wood shop, where teenagers were calling the shots and shaping the planks for boats. The teenagers acquired the wood through a stroke of luck.  Carla Murphy, a programming manager for the New York City Fire Department, was out running through Madison Square Park in October when “Ghost Forest” caught her attention. She stopped dead in her tracks and began listening to the exhibition’s accompanying soundscape. It reminded her of the nature tours that students embark on near the South Bronx with a nonprofit organization — Rocking the Boat — for which she is a trustee. Inspiration hit just as Brooke Kamin Rapaport, the park conservancy’s deputy director and chief curator, was passing by. “Hello, I know this is crazy,” Murphy recalled saying. “But I would like to take your trees.” ADVERTISEMENT Rocking the Boat is a nonprofit organization that teaches students in Hunts Point about the great outdoors by building wooden boats and sailing them. The organization often sources its wood through donations, and after Murphy asked the Madison Square Park Conservancy about taking the trees, Rapaport and the artist agreed. The conservancy devoted a portion of its budget to hiring Tri-Lox, a Brooklyn workshop specializing in wood. On Friday, a carpentry crew arrived at the park with a portable sawmill. As they felled the trees and stripped the bark, nearly a dozen students involved with Rocking the Boat watched and learned. “This is the first time seeing how the trees get harvested,” said Mouctar Barry, 16, from the Hunts Point neighborhood in the Bronx. He joined the group three years ago for an after school program and grew to love working on boats. Like many of the students, he was unfamiliar with Lin’s work until he learned of her donation. Then he started researching the artist’s other monuments and sculptures. “It’s interesting how she harvested trees, and now we are using them,” Barry said. “We are giving the trees a new life and a new meaning.” The situation was certainly unusual for the Madison Square Park Conservancy. “This is the first time an art piece has not left the park in one piece,” said Tom Reidy, the conservancy employee who organized the deinstallation. ADVERTISEMENT As the wood went through the mobile sawmill at the park, Rapaport reflected on its long journey and final destination. “The Atlantic white cedar trees have great resiliency,” she said. “They were sourced from a dying forest. They stood in Madison Square Park as symbols and signposts for six months to demonstrate the physical materiality of climate change. And now they are being repurposed with new meaning.” On Monday, the teenagers were at the work shop. “We don’t want it to sink,” Joshua Garcia, 17, said as he was describing how he was adding the wood to the 28-foot-boat in front of him. The teenagers would need to scarf and rivet the wood, carefully angling each plank and sealing the frame together with paint. Completing the boat — the first of five using the wood from Lin’s artwork — will take about a year and will have been made by about 20 teenagers. Rocking the Boat started as a volunteer project in 1995 when its founder, Adam Green, began working with students in an East Harlem junior high school. After migrating uptown to the Bronx a year later, Rocking the Boat developed after school and summer programs that often bring students into nature.  The organization also provides social services, academic tutoring and career planning; some participants have gone on to careers in carpentry and marine biology, or have gotten degrees in environmental engineering. Green said that students start by building the boat’s backbone. The cedar planks are individually shaped and attached to this sort of skeleton until the hull is completed. Strengthening the stem and stern comes next with oak outwales and a ribbed frame providing support. (The rest of the boat is cedar.) The interior is later fitted with floorboards and seats; students also craft their oars by hand and finish the project by naming their boat and decorating it with paint. By next summer, the boat containing elements of Lin’s artwork will have its maiden voyage, pushed past the salt marsh shores near its launch ramp and into the Bronx River where herons and egrets glide above the water. “The South Bronx is a deeply under-resourced community but has an immense natural resource in the river that can improve people’s lives,” Green said. “Our role is connecting the neighborhood to the water.” ADVERTISEMENT The teenagers working on the boat this week intend to stick around for that first ride down the river. “When I’m working on boats, I’m in my happy place,” said Deborah Simmons, 17, an apprentice in the wood shop as she was sanding down another plank. “I’m just going, going. I’m letting myself flow through the wood. I’m in the zone.”"
" WASHINGTON — Private lenders will play a greater role in funding disaster recovery under a program announced Tuesday, moving to fill a gap left by sluggish federal aid programs that take years to get money to victims of floods, wildfires and other catastrophes. The program, funded in part by the financial giant Morgan Stanley, will pay owners of apartment buildings to rebuild more quickly, so they don’t have to wait for federal funds. Those loans would be repaid by taxpayers — including interest paid to Morgan Stanley, which concerns some climate and disaster experts. “It’s definitely important to explore new ways of speeding up assistance timelines,” said Miyuki Hino, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who focuses on managing the effects of climate change. “But this arrangement poses some new challenges.” ADVERTISEMENT The program reflects the government’s struggle to keep up with the frequency and intensity of disasters as climate change worsens. Victims often wait years for help to get back into their homes because money for repairs moves so slowly. The longest to wait are often renters, who are more likely than homeowners to be people of color or to have low incomes. “Disaster recovery is not equitable in this country,” said Priscilla Almodovar, president and chief executive officer of Enterprise Community Partners, a Washington-based housing nonprofit. “Renters are the hardest hit.” To shorten that wait, Enterprise and Morgan Stanley said they will begin loaning money to owners of multifamily rental buildings to repair the damage to those complexes, making it quicker for renters to move back home. The loans are to be paid back with interest using disaster money from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to Enterprise. The department provides the bulk of federal disaster recovery money through its Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery program. Morgan Stanley declined an interview request. Joan Tally, managing director for community development finance at Morgan Stanley, said in a statement that the program would “accelerate the flow of capital for affordable rental housing in communities impacted by natural disasters.” ADVERTISEMENT On average, it takes 20 months after a disaster before HUD’s housing assistance programs begin distributing money, according to research by the Urban Institute. And those programs were often still distributing money two years after that. The delay in distributing the money reflects the ad hoc nature of HUD’s disaster recovery spending. Congress has never given the department permission to establish a permanent program for disasters. Instead, lawmakers must decide after every disaster whether to give HUD money to help victims. As a result, the delay between a disaster and Congress providing funding for recovery through HUD can last months or years. The agency must then spend months creating a program to distribute the money to states, which in turn decide how to distribute it to local governments. The latest round of disaster money approved by Congress demonstrates that delay. The legislation, which President Biden signed on Sept. 30, provides funds to help people in 10 states recover from hurricanes and other disasters in 2020, most of which occurred more than a year ago. A spokesman for HUD, Michael Burns, said the agency has allowed its disaster funding to go toward repaying some loans in the past. He said HUD has yet to formally determine whether the loans announced by Enterprise can be repaid from disaster funds, because the rules for the latest round of funding have not been finalized.  Lawmakers have introduced bills that would make those changes. But those bills have yet to pass. Ms. Almodovar, the head of Enterprise, said her group has also pushed Congress to make that change. Enterprise declined to say how much it would charge in interest for its loans, saying only that it would be in the “mid-single digits.” Ms. Almodovar said the rates must reflect the fact that the loans are not backed up by collateral. ADVERTISEMENT She said that funding disaster loans through the private market provides access to a deep source of money, making it possible to expand the program, which is starting in Louisiana, Oregon and Iowa. In the absence of fixes to the disaster recovery program, climate experts said the new lending arrangement from Enterprise and Morgan Stanley was useful. That program “responds to a real need,” said Liz Koslov, a professor in the urban planning department at the University of California, Los Angeles. But she said it was nonetheless problematic, part of a broader trend of private companies that profit from disasters. Carlos Martín, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who has researched the effect of federal disaster programs, said the poor treatment of renters concerned him more than companies making money from those events. He said the new program is likely to help renters move back home faster. “We’re neglecting rental communities,” Dr. Martín said. “Our federal disaster relief response focuses on property and not people.”"
" Este otoño, cuando los científicos planeaban una expedición en México para contar los ejemplares de uno los animales más amenazados del mundo, una tímida marsopa llamada vaquita, temieron que no quedara ninguna por encontrar. El último recuento, en 2019, calculó que solo quedaban unas diez. Al mismo tiempo, los pescadores de la zona se preparaban para salir con las redes ilegales que, según los científicos, están llevando a las marsopas a la extinción: paredes de malla que cuelgan en posición vertical bajo la superficie, hasta seis metros de profundidad y que se extienden a lo largo del equivalente a varios campos de fútbol americano. Llamadas redes de enmalle, atrapan camarones y peces. También enredan a las vaquitas, ahogando a los mamíferos. Los investigadores afirman que las redes son la única causa conocida del catastrófico declive de la especie, pero deshacerse de ellas ha resultado ser todo un reto. ADVERTISEMENT En medio de una crisis mundial de la biodiversidad, con un millón de especies en peligro de extinción, la historia de la vaquita muestra cómo incluso las soluciones obvias —en este caso, poner fin a la pesca ilegal— requieren voluntad política, aplicación de la ley y un profundo compromiso con las comunidades locales para satisfacer las necesidades tanto de las personas como de los animales. “El gobierno, hasta ahorita, no nos ha dado una respuesta efectiva o algo efectivo cómo vamos a mantener a nuestras familias sin salir a trabajar ilegalmente”, dijo Ramón Franco Díaz, presidente de una federación de cooperativas pesqueras en San Felipe, un pueblo junto al hábitat de las vaquitas. “Los niños ocupan comer, ocupan vestir”. Los primeros resultados del estudio de las vaquitas de este año, finalizado a principios de noviembre, muestran que los animales siguen existiendo, pero al filo de la navaja. Los expertos en mamíferos marinos dicen que la recuperación es posible, pero solo si su hábitat queda libre de redes de enmalle. En cambio, la pesca ilegal en la zona está muy extendida y ocurre a la vista de todos. Incluso cuando un equipo de científicos de México y Estados Unidos llegó a San Felipe para el recuento de este año, parecía que continuaba sin cesar. ADVERTISEMENT La población de la vaquita marina se ha desplomado de unos 600 individuos en 1997 a alrededor de diez en 2019. Pero existen ejemplos de especies en peligro de extinción que se recuperan a partir de números igualmente diminutos, y la encuesta de 2019 documentó tres crías saludables entre las marsopas restantes. Desde entonces, al menos una vaquita ha muerto en una red de enmalle, según los activistas. “Se están extinguiendo por actividades humanas, pudiéndolo evitar”, dijo Jorge Urbán Ramírez, biólogo que dirige el programa de investigación de mamíferos marinos de la Universidad Autónoma de Baja California Sur. “No es prioritario”. Para proteger a las vaquitas, un acuerdo del gobierno mexicano prohíbe las redes de enmalle en gran parte del Alto Golfo de California, el único lugar donde viven estos mamíferos. Otro acuerdo prohíbe la pesca en una sección mucho más pequeña del golfo, denominada oficialmente zona de tolerancia cero, donde se han visto vaquitas en los últimos años. Pero en San Felipe es como si las normas no existieran. Este otoño, los barcos de pesca que llevaban abiertamente redes de enmalle al golfo recibieron el saludo de integrantes de la Marina mexicana. El 3 de noviembre, los científicos contaron 117 barcos de pesca en la zona prohibida en un solo día, según un informe obtenido por The New York Times. Refiriéndose a la zona de tolerancia cero, que abarca un área de 12 por 24 kilómetros, el texto del acuerdo “prohíbe la navegación de cualquier tipo de embarcación dentro de esta zona, excepto barcos de vigilancia, investigación o recuperación de redes”. También establece que “se prohíbe la pesca de cualquier tipo”. ADVERTISEMENT Jonathan White, un conservacionista que recaudó dinero para ayudar a financiar el proyecto de investigación, estuvo a bordo de uno de los barcos durante parte del periodo de investigación. En dos días diferentes en octubre, dijo, contó en la zona de tolerancia cero más de 65 barcos de pesca, la cantidad designada para desencadenar el nivel más alto de represión. En cambio, no vio ninguna aplicación de la ley. “Es tan atroz”, dijo. Del mismo modo, aquel día de principios de noviembre en el que los científicos contaron más de cien embarcaciones en la zona de tolerancia cero, no había ninguna señal de que se estuviera aplicando la ley, según el informe de los científicos. Al preguntarle por la aparente falta de acción, el jefe de la unidad de comunicación social de la Marina, el contralmirante José H. Orozco Tocaven, dijo que los oficiales estaban adaptando la norma a las necesidades sociales sobre el terreno, permitiendo efectivamente la presencia de hasta 65 embarcaciones en la zona de tolerancia cero. Nunca han visto más de dicha cantidad, dijo. Pero reconoció la falta general de aplicación de la norma. “Intentamos evitar la confrontación”, dijo el contralmirante, y citó disturbios y agitación previos. En la última década, la demanda de un gran pez llamado totoaba ha hecho que la situación sea especialmente volátil. Toda la pesca de totoaba, otra especie en peligro de extinción, es ilegal. Pero la vejiga natatoria de ese pez alcanza precios elevados en China por sus supuestos beneficios para la salud, y el comercio ha atraído al crimen organizado. Aunque muchos pescadores locales se mantienen alejados de la totoaba, la tentación de ganar mucho dinero es fuerte. ADVERTISEMENT El domingo, las autoridades anunciaron la detención de seis personas relacionadas con el tráfico de totoaba. Todas las redes de enmalle son peligrosas para la vaquita, dicen los científicos, pero las que se usan para la totoaba son particularmente letales porque las dos especies son casi del mismo tamaño. Con el permiso de las autoridades mexicanas, dos grupos de defensa del medio ambiente, el Museo de la Ballena y la Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, solían patrullar el golfo para retirar las redes de enmalle desatendidas. Esto enfurecía a los pescadores, que a menudo piden préstamos para comprar los aparejos. En los últimos años, los enfrentamientos se volvieron cada vez más violentos, y los pescadores se han abalanzado sobre los barcos más grandes en el mar y a veces les han disparado. Un pescador murió después de que su pequeña embarcación chocó con un barco de Sea Shepherd en uno de estos episodios en diciembre. Un grupo liderado por pescadores de totoaba se amotinó, según el contralmirante Orozco y los ecologistas, y quemaron un barco interceptor de la marina de alta velocidad, otro bote y algunos vehículos. Ahora los grupos conservacionistas ya no pueden retirar las redes, solo denunciarlas. ADVERTISEMENT Rodrigo López Olivo, que emplea redes de enmalle para capturar camarones y otras especies legales, recuerda haber visto vaquitas un puñado de veces a lo largo de sus 20 años en el golfo. Las marsopas le parecían hermosas, dijo. Pero no ve un futuro para ellas. “¿Cómo va a dejar morir un pueblo para cuidar seis animales?”, preguntó López. Las autopsias han demostrado que las vaquitas encontradas muertas en el golfo suelen estar gordas y sanas, excepto por la espuma en sus pulmones que revela la causa de su muerte: ahogamiento. En 2017, los científicos intentaron llevar a algunas vaquitas al cautiverio, pero abandonaron el esfuerzo cuando las marsopas se estresaron tanto por el contacto con los humanos que una murió. Barbara Taylor, una bióloga de la Oficina Nacional de Administración Oceánica y Atmosférica de Estados Unidos que ha trabajado en la conservación de la vaquita durante décadas, dijo que las pocas marsopas que quedan pueden tener una predilección por evitar las redes. “Las que están ahí fuera son sobrevivientes”, dijo. “Pero hay que darles una oportunidad para luchar”. Estudios recientes demuestran que esta especie, aislada desde hace mucho tiempo, es naturalmente resistente a la baja diversidad genética, lo que significa que para ella los problemas de salud derivados de la endogamia —a menudo un peligro en las poblaciones disminuidas— son menos preocupantes. Estados Unidos ya ha prohibido los mariscos procedentes del Alto Golfo debido a la situación de la vaquita, y las autoridades están estudiando otras medidas. “Esto es algo que nos tomamos muy en serio”, dijo Kelly Milton, representante comercial adjunta de Estados Unidos para el medio ambiente y los recursos naturales. “Perder a la vaquita sería devastador”. Sin embargo, el camarón de San Felipe se envía actualmente a otros estados mexicanos, y algunos lugareños dicen que es probable que las capturas se mezclen y el camarón prohibido de todos modos termine en Estados Unidos. ADVERTISEMENT Durante una parte de la última década, los pescadores recibían un estipendio para mantenerse fuera del agua. Pero después de que el actual presidente de México, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, asumiera el cargo en 2018, ese programa terminó y las autoridades han tolerado las redes de enmalle, dicen los pescadores locales. “La desaparición de la vaquita marina representa un fracaso flagrante y abarcador por parte del Estado de México y sus instituciones”, dijo Randall Reeves, presidente de un panel científico internacional creado por la Unión Internacional para la Conservación de la Naturaleza para evaluar el estado global de ballenas, delfines y marsopas. Cuando se les pidió que hicieran comentarios para este artículo, los funcionarios ambientales mexicanos dijeron en un comunicado que “el gobierno mexicano reitera de manera enfática su deseo de cuidar y preservar la biodiversidad natural que tiene nuestro país, particularmente se atiende y busca la conservación de la vaquita marina”. Al mismo tiempo, dijeron, era necesario tomar en consideración “el bienestar de las comunidades pesqueras”. Sin embargo, un pequeño equipo que intenta pescar con redes alternativas ha enfrentado obstáculos. El método captura menos, pero algunos pescadores creen que podría tener una lógica económica si pudieran vender camarones sostenibles a un precio más elevado. No se ha desarrollado ningún mercado de este tipo en la zona, y esta temporada no han podido obtener permisos para los aparejos especiales. ADVERTISEMENT Algunos miembros de la comunidad se niegan a renunciar a una especie que consideran parte de su patrimonio nacional. Ismael Angulo, que creció en una familia de pescadores, recuerda un día de 2004 en el que su padre, Leonardo, fallecido en 2016, trajo a casa una vaquita marina que, según dijo, había encontrado flotando muerta en el agua. “Es casi como que si se hubiera encontrado una sirena”, dijo Angulo. Sus tíos y primos acudieron a ver a la criatura y posaron para las fotos. Años más tarde, cuando vio un debate en las redes sociales sobre la existencia de las vaquitas —algunos lugareños creen que son un mito—, publicó la foto. Algunos pescadores se enojaron con él por apoyar la postura de los científicos, dijo, pero no borró la publicación. “Yo, como hijo de pescador, deseo una solución tanto para los pescadores como para la especie”, dijo Angulo.

As scientists planned an expedition in Mexico this fall to count one of the world’s most endangered animals, a shy porpoise called a vaquita, they dreaded the possibility that there would be none left to find. The last survey, in 2019, estimated that only about 10 remained. At the same time, fishermen in the area were preparing to set out with the illegal nets that scientists say are driving the porpoises to extinction: walls of mesh that hang upright below the surface, up to 20 feet deep and stretching the length of several football fields. Called gill nets, they trap shrimp and fish. They also entangle vaquitas, drowning the mammals. Researchers say the nets are the only known cause for the species’ catastrophic decline, but getting rid of them has turned out to be a challenge. ADVERTISEMENT Amid a global biodiversity crisis, with an estimated million species threatened with extinction, the story of the vaquita shows how even obvious solutions — in this case, putting a stop to illegal fishing — require political will, enforcement and deep engagement with local communities to meet the needs of both people and animals. “The government still hasn’t given us a solution or an effective way to support our families without going out to fish illegally,” said Ramón Franco Díaz, president of a federation of fishing cooperatives in San Felipe, a town alongside the vaquitas’ habitat. “The children need food and clothes.” Early results from this year’s vaquita survey, completed in early November, show that the animals still exist, but on a knife’s edge. Marine mammal experts say a recovery is possible, but only if their habitat is free of gill nets. Instead, illegal fishing in the area is widespread and happening in plain view. Even as a team of scientists from Mexico and the United States arrived in San Felipe for this year’s count, it appeared to continue unabated. ADVERTISEMENT The vaquita population has plummeted from an estimated 600 individuals in 1997 to around 10 in 2019. But examples exist of endangered species climbing back from similarly tiny numbers, and the 2019 survey documented three healthy calves among the remaining porpoises. Since then, at least one vaquita has died in a gill net, according to advocates. “They’re going extinct because of human activities, even though it could be avoided,” said Jorge Urbán Ramírez, a biologist who runs the marine mammal research program at the Autonomous University of Baja California Sur. “It’s not a priority.” To protect vaquitas, a Mexican government order prohibits gill nets in much of the upper Gulf of California, the only place where the mammals live. Another bans all fishing in a far smaller section of the gulf, officially called the zero-tolerance area, where they’ve been spotted in recent years. But in San Felipe, it’s as if the rules don’t exist. This fall, fishing boats openly carrying gill nets were waved into the gulf by members of the Mexican Navy. On Nov. 3, scientists counted 117 fishing boats in the off-limits area in a single day, according to a report obtained by The New York Times. ADVERTISEMENT Referring to the zero-tolerance area, which covers about 7 miles by 15 miles, the text of the order “prohibits the navigation of any type of vessel within this zone, except for surveillance, investigation or net-recovery boats.” It also states that “fishing of any kind is prohibited.” Jonathan White, a conservationist who raised money to help fund the survey project, was aboard one of the vessels for part of the research period. On two different days in October, he said, he counted more than 65 fishing boats, the number designated to trigger the highest level of crackdown, in the zero-tolerance area. Instead, he saw no enforcement at all. “It’s so egregious,” Mr. White said. Similarly, on that day in early November when scientists counted more than 100 boats in the zero-tolerance area, there was no sign of enforcement, according to the scientists’ report. Asked about the apparent lack of action, the chief of public affairs for the navy, Rear Adm. José H. Orozco Tocaven, said officers were adapting the rule to the social needs on the ground, effectively allowing the presence of up to 65 boats in the zero-tolerance area. They had never seen more than that, he said. But he acknowledged the overall lack of enforcement. “We are trying to avoid confrontation,” the admiral said, citing previous riots and unrest. ADVERTISEMENT Over the past decade, demand for a large fish called the totoaba has made the situation particularly volatile. All fishing for totoaba, which is also endangered, is illegal. But its swim bladder commands high prices in China for perceived health benefits, and the trade has attracted organized crime. While many local fishermen steer clear of totoaba, the temptation for big money is strong. On Sunday, the authorities announced the arrests of six people in connection with tototaba trafficking. All gill nets are dangerous for vaquita, scientists say, but the ones used for totoaba are particularly lethal because the two species are about the same size. With the permission of the Mexican authorities, two advocacy groups, the Whale Museum and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, used to patrol the gulf to remove unattended gill nets. This infuriated fishermen, who often take out loans to buy the gear. In recent years, confrontations became increasingly violent, with fishermen swarming the larger ships at sea and sometimes shooting at them. A fisherman died after his small boat collided with a Sea Shepherd vessel in one such episode in December. A group led by totoaba fishermen rioted, according to Admiral Orozco and advocates, burning a high-speed navy interceptor boat, another boat and some vehicles. Now the conservation groups are no longer allowed to remove nets, only to report them. ADVERTISEMENT Rodrigo López Olivo, who uses gill nets to catch shrimp and other legal species, recalled seeing vaquitas a handful of times over his 20 years on the gulf. He found the porpoises beautiful, he said. But he doesn’t see a future for them. “How are you going to let a town die to care for six animals?” Mr. López asked. Autopsies have shown that vaquitas found dead in the gulf tend to be fat and healthy, except for the foam in their lungs that reveals their cause of death: drowning. In 2017, scientists tried to bring some into captivity, but they abandoned the effort when the porpoises became so stressed by contact with humans that one died. Barbara Taylor, a biologist with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries who has worked on vaquita conservation for decades, said the few remaining porpoises may have a predilection for avoiding nets. “The ones that are out there are survivors,” she said. “But you have to give them a fighting chance.” Recent studies show that the long-isolated species is naturally resilient to low genetic diversity, meaning that health problems from inbreeding, often a danger in diminished populations, are less of a concern. The United States has already banned seafood from the Upper Gulf because of the vaquita situation and officials are considering further measures. “This is something that we are very serious about,” said Kelly Milton, the assistant United States trade representative for environment and natural resources. “Losing the vaquita would be devastating.” ADVERTISEMENT Shrimp from San Felipe is currently shipped to other Mexican states, though, and some locals say it’s likely that the catches are getting mixed and the banned shrimp is ending up in the United States anyway. Over part of the last decade, fishermen received a stipend to stay off the water. But after Mexico’s current president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, assumed office in 2018, that program ended and the authorities have tolerated gill nets, local fishermen say. “The vaquita’s demise represents a gross and encompassing failure by the state of Mexico and its institutions,” said Randall Reeves, chairman of an international scientific panel created by the International Union for Conservation of Nature to assess the global status of whales, dolphins and porpoises. When asked to comment for this article, Mexican environmental officials said in a statement that “the Mexican government emphatically reiterates its desire to care for and preserve the natural biodiversity of our country, and particularly cares for and seeks the conservation of the vaquita.” At the same time, they said, it was necessary to take into consideration “the well-being of fishing communities.” ADVERTISEMENT However, a small team trying to fish with alternative nets has faced roadblocks. The method catches less, but some fishermen think it could make economic sense if they could sell sustainable shrimp at a premium. No such market has been developed in the area, and this season they have not been able to get permits for the special gear. Some in the community refuse to give up on a species they see as part of their national heritage. Ismael Angulo, who grew up in a fishing family, remembers a day in 2004 when his father, Leonardo, who died in 2016, brought home a vaquita that he said he had found floating dead in the water. “It was almost like finding a mermaid,” Mr. Angulo said. His uncles and cousins came over to see the creature and they posed for pictures. Years later, when he saw a debate on social media about whether vaquitas existed at all — some locals think they are a myth — he posted the photo. Some fishermen got angry with him for supporting the scientists’ position, he said, but he did not delete the post. “As the son of a fisherman, I want a solution both for the fishermen and for the species,” Mr. Angulo said."
" This article is part of our latest DealBook special report on the trends that will shape the coming decades. Eight years ago, Kevin Prevo started making changes to the land in southern Iowa that his family has farmed for five generations. Mr. Prevo stopped tilling the fields between crop cycles and started planting cover crops he does not harvest — a mix including rye, turnips, radishes and sunflowers — between rotations of his cash crops, corn, soybeans and rye. The changes were intended to help the soil hold additional water and to prevent erosion, leading to more abundant yields, but have the added benefit of drawing more carbon dioxide into the ground and keeping it there. Then, in 2019, Mr. Prevo met a representative from Indigo, a Boston-based agricultural technology start-up that pays growers for carbon credits that result from implementing climate-friendly practices like the ones already in use on his 1,400-acre farm. The Prevos rely mostly on manure from the hogs they raise to fertilize their fields; last year, with guidance from Indigo, they stretched it further, enabling them to eliminate the use of synthetic fertilizer, one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture. That change is expected to generate several hundred carbon credits for the farm, which Indigo has contracted to sell for $27 a piece to buyers, such as JPMorgan Chase, Shopify and North Face that are looking to counteract their greenhouse gas emissions. ADVERTISEMENT “It’s showing a lot of promise in terms of keeping yields the way they were and saving us on nitrogen costs,” said Mr. Prevo of the farm’s new fertilizer regimen. “We’ve always thought about cutting back, but this pushed us in the right direction.” Indigo is one of at least a dozen entities at work on systems to pay farmers for reducing the use of carbon-intensive nitrogen fertilizer, planting cover crops to draw carbon dioxide into the soil and avoiding the tilling that releases it back into the atmosphere. Using a mix of on-the-ground soil sampling and predictive modeling, Indigo says it can determine how much additional carbon a farm has sequestered, or abated, by changing its practices. Each metric ton of carbon removed from the atmosphere, or avoided, generates one carbon credit. Carbon offsets have been around for more than three decades, but demand for them has grown in recent years as companies faced increasing pressure to demonstrate a commitment to climate action. According to the conservation nonprofit Forest Trends, in 2016, less than $200 million was invested globally in voluntary carbon offset purchases, which typically finance projects such as planting or protecting forests, capturing methane from landfills and mineralizing carbon; this year, for the first time, the figure is expected to top $1 billion. ADVERTISEMENT Farmland is a new entrant in the offset conversation, but it has quickly piqued the interest of corporate buyers, especially those with agricultural products in their supply chains. “It tells a great story, if you can tell Americans buying a product that their dollars are going to an American program that benefits farmers,” said Chris Harbourt, the global head of carbon for Indigo. Global cropland has the potential to sequester as much as 570 million metric tons of carbon per year, according to one estimate, and experts say enlisting it to store greenhouse gas emissions will be essential to heading off the worst effects of climate change. But the same experts caution that substantial challenges — some that apply to any nature-based carbon offset, some of which are specific to farmland — must be met before compensating farmers for carbon capture becomes a robust market. One fundamental concern is the accuracy of today’s estimates for soil-based carbon removals. Unlike with forestry projects, where the physical chemistry of carbon storage is better understood and predictive models have benefited from years of real-world data, how carbon accumulates in soil is still something of a black box. It can vary substantially based on composition, geography and depth, and there’s a relative scarcity of historical sampling data. “Taking meter-long soil cores on hundreds or thousands of acres, it’s really onerous,” said Giana Amador, the co-founder and policy director of Carbon180, a climate policy nonprofit. Over a dozen different protocols have been developed for generating ag-based soil credits, and they vary widely in how much physical sampling is called for (or even whether it’s required at all). Ms. Amador says that to accurately evaluate soil carbon content, rigorous on-the-ground sampling is a must. Another issue is permanence. Offsets are sold on the promise that carbon will be stored for decades, but agricultural decisions are made annually, based on a complex set of market and environmental factors. ADVERTISEMENT “If you do ‘no-till’ for one year, but the next year you switch back, the carbon dioxide is released, and the climate value is effectively zero,” said Jonathan Goldberg, the chief executive and founder of Carbon Direct, which advises large corporations on their carbon management strategies. Indigo, which will follow a protocol in development by the Climate Action Reserve, a leading offset registry, deals with this uncertainty by pooling credits together and holding back a portion of them as a buffer against future practice reversals (a similar strategy is used in forestry projects, to cover illegal logging or fires). Proving that the carbon farms sequester would otherwise remain in the atmosphere presents a thornier challenge. Because carbon offsets counterbalance emissions occurring elsewhere — effectively giving their buyer a license to continue to pollute — it’s important that they represent carbon capture, or abatement, that wouldn’t have taken place in the absence of the payment. Today’s protocols use a variety of approaches that aim to screen for this “additionality” and avoid paying for practices farmers have always used. Gradable Carbon, a new product from the start-up Farmers Business Network, will credit changes implemented up to two years before enrollment; Bayer, the German conglomerate that owns agriculture brands such as Roundup, pays farmers for beneficial practices adopted as far back as 2012. Others, like the new standard in development by the Climate Action Reserve, will count select farming practices that store more carbon than common practices in the local region. Danny Cullenward, the policy director at Carbon Plan, a nonprofit that evaluates climate solutions, points out that none of those standards guarantees carbon storage that is truly new and motivated by an offset payment. Like all carbon offsets sold on voluntary markets, farm-based offsets are unregulated; there is no legal standard for what constitutes a credit, which has led to a wide range in quality. According to Dr. Cullenward, buyers looking for unimpeachable agricultural credits — where the carbon sequestration is real, additional and permanent — will need to push projects toward more rigorous standards and should be prepared to pay significantly more than the $15 to $30 that the market demands. ADVERTISEMENT That’s because truly additional, permanent storage of carbon may be at odds with other financial considerations that govern how farmland is managed. Practice changes like reducing fertilizer inputs and tillage can cut crop yields, for instance. “You’re making maybe $20 an acre, at the most, and a 20-cent increase in corn will have more impact on your economics than the credits,” said Jim Bunch, a co-founder of Impact Delta, which advises investors on their environmental and social impact. Chris Lehe, a farmer in Indiana, is working with Indigo to generate carbon credits for the no-till practices he uses on some of his 4,800 acres. Mr. Lehe has been experimenting with cover crops, too, but after three years, he’s weighing whether to continue. Planting them costs him $40 per acre, more than the practice is likely to generate in carbon credits. “You’re going to have a hard time convincing people to switch to cover cropping for the purpose of the carbon market,” Mr. Lehe said. “Our margins are tight as it is, and I don’t think the amount of income right now is enough to incentivize guys to change the way they’ve been farming for decades.” Despite all these obstacles, corporate interest in farm-based offsets has remained steady. Boston Consulting Group, which has pledged to reduce its net emissions to zero by 2030, has been among early purchasers. In a statement, the company says it believes that soil-based offsets hold promise and that investment and clear demand signals are necessary for standards and practices to improve. Mr. Goldberg of Carbon Direct said that he had helped clients buy soil-based offsets, but only from sources where there’s a clear path to improvement in standards and protocols. “Where we need to be for climate and carbon removal, none of the verticals on their own will be sufficient,” he said. “We don’t have enough forests, and we don’t have enough ability to change soils. All of them need to work, and they all have different trade-offs.”"
" This article is part of our latest DealBook special report on the trends that will shape the coming decades. Insurers have a uniquely powerful role in addressing climate change — and one that may help determine the coal industry’s very existence in the next two decades, if not sooner. Insurers are not only among the largest institutional investors, their ability to withdraw insurance coverage can hinder a company’s operations. Insurance companies also pay when climate change causes natural disasters, which cost the industry $82 billion last year, according to the insurer Munich Re. AXA, the French insurance company, has eagerly leaned into its levers for reducing carbon emissions. In 2015, AXA became the first insurer to start divesting from coal, and it is now chair of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance, a pledge signed by eight of the world’s largest insurers and reinsurers who have committed to have underwriting portfolios with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The majority of the signatories are European insurers. U.S. insurers, including AIG and Berkshire Hathaway, have not agreed to the terms. AXA’s chief executive, Thomas Buberl, has made it his mission to change that. ADVERTISEMENT You were perhaps the first to embrace insurers’ role in climate change. What drove your decision? We saw this whole question around climate transition very early on because as an insurer, you basically have two perspectives: You have the investment perspective, and you’ve got the underwriting perspective. And from the underwriting perspective, you also see, later on, the claims. And what we’ve seen from very early on was: Yes, investment in coal, and so on, seems to be quite an isolated and attractive investment — but then when you blend in the claims side, what happens to natural catastrophes and companies that we insure in terms of flooding, fires and so on? What happens to the patients that we have with their health? The equation doesn’t work. Why do you believe that underwriting is the key to driving out the coal industry? Even if all the insurers say, “We don’t invest in coal anymore,” even if all the banks say, “We don’t invest in coal anymore,” there is still private individuals who say, “I’ll give you the money for coal.” Whereas on the insurance side, if you don’t have the insurance, you will have no financing — whether it’s private, public, from an insurer, from an asset manager, whatever. And so we said, “Look, by bringing the majority of this market together, because [there’s] only let’s say 12, 15 actors globally who do this business — if we get together and if we agree on principles of what to do we still insure and what do we not insure anymore — without violating any antitrust rules — we will create a very powerful coalition to really drive this market out. There are a couple ways in which the government could step in on this issue. A regulator could integrate capital charges for unsustainable investments. Or it could take a taxonomy approach for green activities like it has in the European Union. Should, or will, that happen in the U.S.? ADVERTISEMENT Look at other areas like diversity quotas. Why have they arrived? Because companies haven’t done their job early enough. Being proactive and making sure that there is enough diversity on their boards, on their management teams and so on. And so I’m always a believer of the basis that you don’t need government if you have sorted it out yourself. Unfortunately, it doesn’t always happen. But in this case, we are still early enough I think, to sort it out ourselves. You’ve met personally with executives of major insurers to encourage them to sign the pledge. When you talk to them, what is their biggest concern? It’s a question of, if I exclude customers, what does it mean for my relationships, what does it mean for my business. Because it is true, all those industries in question on the insurance side, the underwriting side, are very large customers. When we went out of coal investment — I had a whole speech from my investment team. “Are you crazy? You will never find investments that have the same yield.” When I look now, five years later, we have allocated over $20 billion — our aim is now to go even further to $24, $25 billion — we have allocated that money into green investments. The yield is not so different to what we would have seen in the coal sector. The same was true on the underwriting side. We had to let go of a significant amount of business by not ensuring corporate use anymore. But have you seen any dip in our gross numbers? No, you haven’t. ADVERTISEMENT In 20 years, will major insurance companies be underwriting coal? You don’t need to wait 20 years for that. Will they be out in five years? No, but if you take us: We are completely out of coal in O.E.C.D [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] by 2030 and non-O.E.C.D. by 2040. I do believe that also, in non-O.E.C.D. countries, the pressure is rising every day. So those dates will probably be brought forward. I would say in 10 years from now, you will be mostly out."
" This article is part of our latest DealBook special report on the trends that will shape the coming decades. Heavy industry uses roughly 149 million terajoules of energy annually, or about 700 times more power than the most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated. The sector’s sheer scale makes reducing its carbon emissions difficult. It would require incredible amounts of heat and power for manufacturing and methods to store vast amounts of power for jets, tankers, and trucks. Trillions of dollars in global assets would need to be retired. And the main sectors in play — aviation, shipping, steel, plastics, aluminum, cement, chemicals and trucking — represent massive swaths of the economy, making it a political third rail of climate change action. But a combination of policy work, technological leaps and industry collaborations has made previously improbable changes into rallying points for more action. “You’ve actually got to move the whole economy,” said Helen Clarkson, the chief executive of Climate Group, a global nonprofit. “We don’t just get a free pass because it’s more difficult.” ADVERTISEMENT RMI, an organization in Colorado focused on sustainability that was previously known as the Rocky Mountain Institute, estimates that steel production, shipping, aviation and trucking alone contribute 40 percent of global carbon emissions, and if left untouched, will eat up twice the remaining global carbon budget to stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming by 2050. There are still immense hurdles, including funding, policy support and unsolved technological challenges. But coalitions and industry groups, including the Energy Transition Commission, which released a 2018 report about such a transition, and Mission Possible Partnership (with support from RMI) have created detailed road maps for sector transformation. The Climate Group’s Steel Zero plan to build demand for carbon-free steel, begun in December, would have been ignored a few years ago, Ms. Clarkson said, but already counts leading global construction firms as supporters. Can some of history’s highest-polluting industries be trusted? Cate Hight, a principal at RMI, admits that greenwashing is possible. But the improving accuracy of digital tools that third-party groups use to track emissions means corporations can be held more accountable. To understand how rapidly the ground is shifting, look at steel, a global industry synonymous with smokestacks and responsible for 7 percent of CO2 emissions. Green steel isn’t just a vision, but a reality. Beginning in 2016, the Swedish steel maker SSAB began developing a fossil-free steel process called Hybrit, which is being tested by the automakers Volvo and Mercedes-Benz. ADVERTISEMENT The pilot process, where iron ore is refined, or reduced, with green hydrogen and renewable energy into oxygen-free sponge iron, which is then shaped with electric arc furnaces into finished steel, will scale up to an operational commercial plant by 2026, which will produce 1.35 million tons of sponge iron annually, said SSAB’s chief technology officer, Martin Pei. Competitors such as ArcelorMittal, Midrex and U.S. Steel have also invested in cutting carbon. Though positive, these steps represent just a start. The Mission Possible Partnership, a climate alliance between industrial leaders, financiers and policy groups like RMI, estimated that the steel industry needs to invest $30 billion every year just to meet increased demand; another $6 billion is needed to make that all net-zero compliant. Green hydrogen presents a particularly lofty challenge; decarbonizing all heavy industry with this high-potency option would require so much electricity that current global electrical generation would need to double, according to RMI. Other heavy industry sectors have focused first on reducing rather than completely eliminating their carbon output. Efficiency excites Ben Schuler, founder and chief executive of Infinitum Electric, a start-up based in Round Rock, Texas, that makes electric motors that are half the size and weight of the standard. His firm’s air-core engines represent a big leap in sustainability; Caterpillar and Rockwell Automation are investors, while the federal government’s Green Proving Ground, which tests nascent building tech in federal buildings, is evaluating Infinitum products for potential wide scale deployment. ADVERTISEMENT Half the electricity in the United States is used to power electric motors, and roughly a third of the growth in global energy demand in the next two decades is expected to come from industrial motors, including those that power fan and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems; compressors; alternators; factory machines; and heat pumps. “There’s a cleaner, better way to do the exact same processes we’ve done for the last 100 years,” said Mr. Schuler, who expects to deliver 15,000 motors in 2022. “It’ll just take a thousand, or tens of thousands, of other companies like us with good ideas doing their part.” The uncertainty of such a shift has Ms. Hight convinced the right pathway is “silver buckshot instead of a silver bullet,” an everything-at-once approach that includes electric motors, vast expansion of renewable power and investment in hydrogen technology. Despite the daunting task ahead, some are optimistic that heavy industry can both shrink its carbon emissions quickly and profit while doing it. In a wide-ranging report released this summer, RMI’s co-founder Amory Lovins argues that electrification, evolution and the efficiency of clean power will bring about a shake-up that creates “trillions of dollars in creative destruction.” The cost of change is radical, but so is the potential return, he wrote: “We’ll learn that many problems look impenetrable until someone cracks them.”"
" The intense rains and heavy winds that descended last week on British Columbia, the Canadian province known for its mountains, coastline and majestic forests, forced 17,000 people from their homes, emptying entire towns and inundating farms. Vancouver, Canada’s third-largest city, lost its road and rail links to the rest of the country, cut off by washed-out bridges and landslides. It was the second time in six months that the province had endured a major weather-related emergency, and experts say the two disasters are probably related to changes in the climate. British Columbia has been besieged this year by record-breaking heat, wildfires and floods. The disasters have killed hundreds — including three people in the recent rains — and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. The impact has rippled across Canada after hobbling the province and the port of Vancouver, which is vital to the country’s economy. ADVERTISEMENT “In the last six months, B.C. has both burned and drowned,” said Merran Smith, the executive director of Clean Energy Canada, a climate program at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver. “So there’s really no greater evidence of climate change right now than here in British Columbia.” In July, record temperatures as high as 121 degrees Fahrenheit brought drought and uncontrollable wildfires. The heat, which was concentrated in the province’s interior, killed 595 people from June to August, and fire consumed an entire town. ADVERTISEMENT The floods last week have spared more lives but have destroyed vital infrastructure and left freight to pile up at Vancouver’s port, Canada’s gateway to Asia. The country’s supply lines have been disrupted as well at a time when American ports are too backed up to offer much help. Experts said that events in this sequence — heat, fire, drought, flood — could produce so-called compound effects. A drought can dry out vegetation, which in turn can fuel and intensify fires. Fire itself can weaken or kill plants and make the soil less permeable, meaning that rain is more likely to run off rather than soak in, causing flash floods and landslides. Rachel White, a professor at the University of British Columbia who studies how large-scale atmospheric patterns contribute to extreme weather, said it was impossible to say for sure whether the extraordinary heat and the devastating rains resulted directly from climate change. “We need to do more research to really try and understand what’s going on here,” she said. “Is this also a sign of climate change or did British Columbia just get incredibly unlucky this year?” ADVERTISEMENT However, she said, one thing is certain: “These events were made worse because of climate change.” A common weather event known as an “atmospheric river” led to the province’s devastating flooding and set rainfall records in several communities. A moisture conveyor belt, perhaps better known as the Pineapple Express, it is a relatively narrow but very long band of fast-moving, moisture-laden air that forms in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii. Normally, such systems release that moisture as intense rain once they reach British Columbia’s coastal mountains and peter out before they enter the dry interior region on the other side. But this atmospheric river was different, said Armel Castellan, a meteorologist with the weather service at Environment and Climate Change Canada. “This had so much potency to it that it was able to ride up those mountains and really unleash into what is otherwise the dry belt,” he said. Alex Hall, a professor of atmospheric science at U.C.L.A., added that the phenomenon was notable for its scale. The interior town of Hope, for instance, was hit with 11.6 inches of rain in 52 hours, about a third more than the amount of rain it usually receives in all of November. “What’s not normal is to have atmospheric river events that are this large,” he said, adding that in terms of rainfall, these events “are nearly equaling the historic record.” ADVERTISEMENT Because the interior region had already had an usually wet fall, the ground was saturated before the storm hit, Mr. Castellan said. Compounding the situation, there was relatively little snow at higher altitudes to soak up water. In addition, the summer of extreme heat, drought and wildfires had left little vegetation to slow or prevent mudslides. “When you have those sequences set up right, you produce even more extreme conditions,” Dr. Hall said. Human meddling with geography has also made things worse. Much of the fertile farmland near Abbotsford was created 100 years ago by draining the Sumas Lake, a process that forced Indigenous people onto other land. While pumps and levees held back some of the water, the storm last week allowed the lake to reassert itself after a century. As the rain poured down and roads closed, panicked shoppers reprised the early days of the pandemic and cleared out several grocery stores, particularly in the Vancouver area. Rebuilding lost bridges, roadways and railways could take months. But Greg Wilson, the director of government relations in British Columbia for the Retail Council of Canada, said that widespread shortages were not likely in the province. Fresh produce can still arrive on the highway from Seattle, the route much of it usually follows to supply Vancouver this time of year. ADVERTISEMENT One highway out of Vancouver reopened to light cars and trucks over the weekend and another restored a single lane of traffic for essential travel. But trucks from elsewhere in Canada are mainly reaching Vancouver by detouring through the United States. And much of the interior of British Columbia, the hardest-hit area, is still open to the rest of Canada by train and truck. “There’s no danger of the Vancouver area running out of food,” Mr. Wilson said. “There will be challenges, but there’s lots of supply.” British Columbia has been a leader in trying to mitigate the effects of climate change, said Barry Prentice, a professor at the University of Manitoba and the former director of its transport institute. In 2008, it introduced North America’s first carbon tax. It has also taken physical measures. The port in Vancouver, he said, has been lifted by about three feet to accommodate rising sea levels. But province’s mountainous nature, he said, limits what is possible and will make rebuilding a difficult and prolonged process. ADVERTISEMENT “To try and make everything resilient is very hard,” he said. “We don’t have many options for routes coming through the mountains.” The delays in reopenings will most likely significantly affect all of Canada since Vancouver’s port connects the country to Asia, both for imports of consumer goods and economically vital exports of resources like grains and potash for fertilizers. While a rail line to the port in Prince Rupert in northern British Columbia remains open to the east, Professor Prentice said that the port could not physically handle all of Vancouver’s traffic on top of its normal operations. While it may be possible to beef up the transportation network during rebuilding, Professor Prentice said that the only long-term solution remained dealing effectively with climate change. Ms. Smith of Clean Energy Canada said that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government had a credible and ambitious climate plan but that the country had yet to rein in its oil and gas industry, particularly oil sands operations based largely in neighboring Alberta. ADVERTISEMENT “We need to reduce the emissions from the oil and gas sector; it is one of Canada’s biggest challenges,” she said. “All of these other good policies, we need to see them implemented without delays. There’s a lot of inaction that gets disguised as flexibility, and we’re past that time.” While the water has started to recede in most flood zones, it is unclear when evacuees will return home or abandoned cars will be returned to their owners. And more danger may be ahead for British Columbia. Forecasts predict another batch of heavy rain this week. Winston Choi-Schagrin contributed reporting."
" WASHINGTON — Tom Perriello saw it coming but could do nothing to stop it. André Kapanga too. Despite urgent emails, phone calls and personal pleas, they watched helplessly as a company backed by the Chinese government took ownership from the Americans of one of the world’s largest cobalt mines. It was 2016, and a deal had been struck by the Arizona-based mining giant Freeport-McMoRan to sell the site, located in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which now figures prominently in China’s grip on the global cobalt supply. The metal has been among several essential raw materials needed for the production of electric car batteries — and is now critical to retiring the combustion engine and weaning the world off climate-changing fossil fuels. Mr. Perriello, a top U.S. diplomat in Africa at the time, sounded alarms in the State Department. Mr. Kapanga, then the mine’s Congolese general manager, all but begged the American ambassador in Congo to intercede. “This is a mistake,” Mr. Kapanga recalled warning him, suggesting the Americans were squandering generations of relationship building in Congo, the source of more than two-thirds of the world’s cobalt. ADVERTISEMENT Presidents starting with Dwight D. Eisenhower had sent hundreds of millions of dollars in aid, including transport planes and other military equipment, to the mineral-rich nation. Richard Nixon intervened, as did the State Department under Hillary Clinton, to sustain the relationship. And Freeport-McMoRan had invested billions of its own — before it sold the mine to a Chinese company. Not only did the Chinese purchase of the mine, known as Tenke Fungurume, go through uninterrupted during the final months of the Obama administration, but four years later, during the twilight of the Trump presidency, so did the purchase of an even more impressive cobalt reserve that Freeport-McMoRan put on the market. The buyer was the same company, China Molybdenum. China’s pursuit of Congo’s cobalt wealth is part of a disciplined playbook that has given it an enormous head start over the United States in the race to dominate the electrification of the auto industry, long a key driver of the global economy. But an investigation by The New York Times revealed a hidden history of the cobalt acquisitions in which the United States essentially surrendered the resources to China, failing to safeguard decades of diplomatic and financial investments in Congo. The sale of the two mines, also flush with copper, highlights the shifting geography and politics of the clean energy revolution, with countries rich in cobalt, lithium and other raw materials needed for batteries suddenly playing the role of oil giants. ADVERTISEMENT The loss of the mines happened under the watch of President Barack Obama, consumed with Afghanistan and the Islamic State, and President Donald J. Trump, a climate-change skeptic committed to fossil fuels and the electoral forces behind them. More broadly, it had roots in the end of the Cold War, according to previously classified documents and interviews with senior officials in the Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump and Biden administrations. For decades, the United States worried that the Soviet Union would gain control of Congo’s copper, cobalt, uranium and other materials used in defense manufacturing. Securing U.S. interests there was a topic of presidential-level concern and involved extensive interventions by the Central Intelligence Agency. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, both Democratic and Republican administrations shifted attention away from containing Communism and slashed generous financial aid that had helped American companies do business in Congo, the documents and interviews show. In Africa, in particular, the United States pivoted toward human rights and good-governance issues. And globally, after 2001, the War on Terror became an all-consuming preoccupation. Mr. Perriello, who has since left government, said he learned of the plan in 2016 to sell Tenke Fungurume not long after touring the mine. The owner had a tarnished reputation for its operations in other countries, and Mr. Perriello had counted himself a skeptic. ADVERTISEMENT Still, he was convinced that American ownership was good not only for the United States but for the people of Congo. Freeport-McMoRan got largely favorable reviews on the ground, was employing thousands of Congolese and had built schools and health care clinics and provided fresh drinking water. “What can we do?” Mr. Perriello recalled asking Linda Thomas-Greenfield — who was then an assistant secretary of state with responsibility for Africa and is now President Biden’s ambassador to the United Nations — about keeping the mine under American control. Mr. Perriello said he raised the issue with the National Security Council as well. (A spokeswoman for Ms. Thomas-Greenfield said she remembered the sale of the mine but not the conversation with Mr. Perriello, and several members of the N.S.C. also said they could not recall such a conversation.) The only serious bidders were Chinese companies, leaving no doubt about the consequences of standing by. “They were able to move swiftly and quicker than anybody else could,” Kathleen L. Quirk, Freeport-McMoRan’s president, said in an interview. “So we got the deal done.” Freeport-McMoRan had been determined to sell. The company, one of the world’s largest copper-mining outfits, had made a catastrophically bad bet on the oil and gas industry just before oil prices tanked and the world began to shift to renewable energy. With debt piling up, the company saw no option but to unload its Congo operations. The American response, in essence, was nothing because it was a straight financial transaction. Though the country, through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, reviews overseas investments in American companies for national security risks, it has no oversight of transactions by American companies abroad. The crisis, exposing significant blind spots of U.S. leaders, was just the kind of opportunity the Chinese government excels at exploiting, according to previously unreported documents and emails and interviews with diplomats, mining executives, government officials and others in China, Congo and the United States. ADVERTISEMENT Over the past year, as the clean energy transition has accelerated, the U.S. government and the private sector have moved more rapidly to recover from past mistakes, scouring the world for new cobalt supplies and deploying cobalt-free batteries in some shorter-range electric cars. But all of that falls far short of Chinese efforts to take over resources critical to a green future, including cobalt, lithium and others. Players in the clean energy revolution are increasingly caught in a cycle of exploitation and greed over resources. At the center of it is the quest for a prized metal: cobalt, a key ingredient in electric cars. “We ‘help’ U.S. businesses abroad,” said Mr. Perriello, pointing to efforts by the State and Commerce Departments on behalf of Walmart and other companies with a big overseas presence. “But that’s not actually a strategy.” A strategy to keep the mine in Western hands — perhaps a government subsidy for Freeport, or tax incentives for a different U.S. company to step in — would have required a tool kit of options requiring a formal government policy. That is something only now being formulated by Congress and the Biden administration. A bill that passed the House last week included tax incentives for buyers of electric vehicles and funding for charging stations across the United States. Separate bipartisan legislation that passed the Senate in June would funnel nearly a quarter-trillion dollars into research and development to compete with China, though none of that would address supply-chain threats like the sale of the Congo mines. The lack of a formal industrial policy for minerals and metals has come at a cost to the United States, diplomats from the last two administrations said. “The U.S. is just not organized like China is to approach this in a systematic way,” said Tibor P. Nagy Jr., an assistant secretary of state for African affairs during the Trump administration. “That is a constant source of frustration to those of us who really see the potential of Africa.” ADVERTISEMENT The fallout is now complicating Mr. Biden’s push to make electric vehicles a central pillar of his climate change agenda. At a General Motors factory in Detroit last week, Mr. Biden acknowledged that “something went wrong along the way,” adding, “You know, up until now, China has been leading in this race, but that’s about to change.” Nixon stood outside the White House with the first lady, who was holding an enormous bouquet of roses, one morning in August 1970. President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire was about to pay a visit. It had been a decade since Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo, had secured independence from Belgium, and as the leader of a country abundant in natural resources, Mobutu found himself with considerable global clout. Not only did he control those resources, but he had emerged as a key intermediary for the United States in its efforts to keep the Soviet Union from making inroads in Africa. Access to minerals and metals in Congo had been a top priority for the United States since at least World War II. Albert Einstein wrote to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1939 urging him to stockpile Congolese uranium, used in the first atomic bombs. ADVERTISEMENT “The United States has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate quantities,” Mr. Einstein wrote, noting that “the most important source of uranium is Belgian Congo.” The United States has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate quantities. There is some good ore in Canada and the former Czechoslovakia, while the most important source of uranium is Belgian Congo.  Uranium, cobalt, copper and other ores from Congo are coveted for their extraordinary purity. They are of such high grade that waste piles from old mines often contain more cobalt and copper than most active mines elsewhere in the world. By the mid-1960s, the C.I.A. had set up one of its most extensive operations in the country, secretly bankrolling a small army of mercenaries and Congolese troops. The agency ran missions with the help of U.S. warplanes to suppress Soviet-backed rebels. “If Zaire goes, every African state will draw the conclusion that the Soviet Union (which they don’t like all that much) is the wave of the future,” Henry Kissinger, the secretary of state, warned Nixon, according to a transcript of the once classified exchange. Africa is important to us, many key products coffee, cocoa, cobalt, chrome, iron ore, diamonds come from Africa, thirty to sixty percent of our consumption; and for our European allies, the figures are even higher.  Corporate America saw the U.S. intervention as an opportunity to make money while promoting American-brand capitalism. Citibank, General Motors, Goodyear and others set up manufacturing outposts or offices in Congo. In 1971, Pan Am built one of the first luxury hotels in Kinshasa, the capital, with financial support from the U.S. government. Mobutu, a charismatic former army sergeant who would become a corrupt, luxury-loving dictator, saw the Americans as an ideal partner in his bid to grow the country’s mining wealth. ADVERTISEMENT With an eye to developing Tenke Fungurume, he reached out to a prominent New York diamond merchant named Maurice Tempelsman, according to a series of now declassified cables, to discuss giving him mining rights in the area. But just before his trip to Washington in August 1970, Mobutu made a surprise announcement: He had decided to contract a Belgian company to develop the mine. Washington went into crisis mode as it tried to wrestle back the concession, and its generosity knew no bounds. “Whatever Mobutu wants, give it to him,” Herman J. Cohen, an American diplomat in Congo at the time, recalled Nixon signaling to his administration. Hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. aid had already been sent to Mobutu. Now Nixon agreed to give him several giant C-130 transport planes, including one that would later be loaded with $60,000 worth of Coca-Cola, at Mobutu’s insistence. The Congolese leader would convert one of the planes into his presidential aircraft, lining the pilot seats in leopard skin. The Department of Defense will have to me by 9:00 tomorrow morning a letter of authorization on the sale of three C-130's. It has got to be a cash deal, but Mobutu said five times “Je suis preparé acheter.”  ADVERTISEMENT The United States also committed $130 million in loan guarantees and other financing to help develop Tenke Fungurume. Separately, a U.S.-funded project that cost more than $800 million brought electricity to the remote area. The campaign reached a tipping point at a black-tie dinner for Mobutu at the White House, according to Mr. Cohen. After the meal, Mr. Tempelsman took Mobutu for a private boat ride on the Potomac. Word soon came that the Americans were getting the mining concession after all, generating speculation about what the two men had discussed. “No one will really dare to say in the open what personal profits General Mobutu made out of the deal concluded with Mr. Tempelsman,” one World Bank official later wrote in a confidential memo, first obtained by a University of Arizona researcher. The United States had won the international competition, at least for the moment. “The Belgians were still acting a little childish over the fact that they were beaten,” read a confidential 1970 letter from the U.S. embassy in Congo to the State Department. Mark Mollison, a mining engineer from New York City, climbed into a Toyota Land Cruiser in southeastern Congo, where he had traveled to visit Tenke Fungurume. It was by then an abandoned construction site with a mythic reputation for buried riches. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Mollison was amazed. He saw hilltops with bald spots where copper and cobalt poked through the surface. The metals were so concentrated they had killed off the grass. “The ore was 10 times as rich as what we were mining in Arizona,” Mr. Mollison recalled. “It was quite incredible. There were also decades-old ruins: The concrete foundation for an ore crusher had turned to rubble and weeds, and an employee golf course had been engulfed by the surrounding brush. It was the late 1990s, and Mr. Mollison belonged to a new wave of mining executives who had arrived to pick up the pieces left by the Tempelsman group two decades earlier. After angling during the Nixon administration to get the concession and spending $250 million, the group had pulled out when it ran into a series of hurdles, including anti-government rebels who shut down a railroad needed to ship the cobalt and copper to the sea. Mr. Kissinger, the secretary of state, helped craft a cable to apologize to the Congolese government in January 1976, explaining that the United States “deeply regrets” the “mothballing” of the project, which left behind little but these ruins. Interest rekindled many years later after Mobutu was overthrown. The rebel leader, Laurent-Désiré Kabila, had recently seized valuable land near Tenke and Fungurume, the two towns that gave the mine its name, and used the perch to launch his insurgency. ADVERTISEMENT “Everybody thought, boy, this is the grand reopening, a new awakening of Congo,” Mr. Mollison said. Western mining executives and their Wall Street bankers, smelling opportunity in the changing leadership, arrived in the rebel region by charter planes to find armed teenagers using rubber stamps with Walt Disney characters to process their passports. The investors gathered on the terrace of what had been a posh hotel, its pool covered in green slime, as Mr. Kabila’s representatives secured financial commitments for mining access. A memo written by one banker summed up Mr. Kabila’s perspective: “Rules of the game: you give and I give.” Lundin Group, a Canadian mining company, was so determined to seal a deal that it agreed to give the rebels $50 million. An adviser to Mr. Kabila told reporters at the time that the cash would almost certainly be used to buy weapons for the rebel takeover. Mr. Mollison’s job, when he arrived several months later, was to evaluate if his company, now called Freeport-McMoRan, should partner with Lundin to finish what Mr. Tempelsman had started at Tenke Fungurume. Freeport-McMoRan would later publicize that undertaking as the biggest private investment ever in Congo. “What’s this place going to need?” Mr. Mollison recalled wondering. “Electric power. Lots of it. Roads. Plenty of water. Just how difficult is it going to be to operate in a place like this?” Freeport-McMoRan eventually landed a controlling 57.75 percent stake in the mine, while Lundin got 24.75 percent. Congo’s state mining enterprise, Gécamines, kept 17.5 percent. By the end of 2007, after yet another civil war in Congo, the project got fully underway. But the roads were in such bad shape that it took an entire day to drive the 100 miles to the mine from the closest major city. Mining executives soon used airplanes to make the commute. ADVERTISEMENT Freeport-McMoRan went on a building spree. It helped construct a highway so cobalt and copper could be exported to other parts of Africa. To ensure it had enough power, the company spent $215 million to refurbish an aging hydroelectric plant. “It was very impressive,” said Pierrot Kitobo Sambisaya, who worked as a metallurgist at the mine for a decade. “It was what I call American style.” Sensitive to concerns that the mine would not benefit the Congolese, Freeport-McMoRan and Lundin drilled wells to provide water to 64 villages, built schools to serve more than 12,000 students and, in Fungurume, where the population had exploded as people arrived to fill jobs, constructed a large market hall to keep vendors dry during the rainy season. They also paid for a brickmaking business with about 370 workers, an anti-malaria project and a series of gardens to preserve rare plants that were being destroyed by activity at the mine. “They were training the Congolese workers not just for menial tasks but getting them degrees and advanced degrees at universities in the United States and elsewhere,” said Mr. Perriello, the Obama-era special envoy to the region. He began to question his critical view of Freeport-McMoRan, which had drawn international protest for harm to the local environment and clashes with local residents near another large mine in Indonesia. Conflicts still emerged. Entire villages — Amoni, Kiboko and Mulumbu — were leveled to make room for the mining complex, and relocating their 1,600 residents was a fraught process. Some protests turned deadly as security forces fought with trespassers being ejected from the land. ADVERTISEMENT Still, this part of Congo had never seen a private-sector project so big, ambitious and lucrative. Freeport-McMoRan had developed one of the most modern and productive cobalt and copper mines in the world, and before long, the Congolese government began pressuring the company for a bigger share of the profits. The company turned to the U.S. government to help push back, and the State Department, under Mrs. Clinton, dispatched the American ambassador to the mine. The ambassador, William J. Garvelink, told Congolese officials that “Freeport-McMoRan (unlike other companies which he described as ‘cowboys’ coming to the DRC only to try to make money quickly) has a long-term vision of its operations in the country,” according to a cable that described a May 2009 meeting. Congo largely backed down, agreeing to a relatively modest increase in its ownership stake, to 20 percent from 17. In signing off on the new arrangement in 2010, Richard Adkerson, Freeport-McMoRan’s chief executive, said the company was “committed to continuing our positive partnership” with the Congolese “for decades to come.” That commitment lasted just six years. Freeport-McMoRan made a monumental blunder. Instead of doubling down on mining, it ventured into fossil fuels, spending $20 billion in 2012 to buy two oil and gas companies. ADVERTISEMENT When oil prices plummeted, Freeport-McMoRan found itself mired in debt. The company shut down offshore oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico and laid off hundreds of workers. It fired the president and other top executives at its money-losing oil and gas division and searched in vain for a buyer. Mr. Adkerson, who had spent most of his career at Freeport-McMoRan, liked to tell a story about making a bad snap on his high school football team in Mississippi and losing a big game. Now he had done it again. And Freeport-McMoRan needed a Hail Mary pass to stay in the game. “It breaks my heart to do it,” Mr. Adkerson told Wall Street analysts in May 2016 when he announced the company would sell Tenke Fungurume. The only bidders that wanted all of the company’s stake were from China. Backed by billions of dollars in government loans, Chinese mining companies had been waiting for just this kind of opportunity. The top bidder was China Molybdenum, which offered $2.65 billion. The company had the money available, and it “allowed them to move very quickly,” Mr. Adkerson said. The news troubled executives at the mine, including Mr. Kapanga, the general manager, who had also worked as a Congolese presidential adviser and diplomat. He phoned the American ambassador, James Swan. “Tenke Fungurume is the jewel in the crown,” Mr. Kapanga said he told Mr. Swan, worried the United States was inexplicably letting go of its biggest private investment in Congo. Mr. Swan declined to comment when contacted by The Times. ADVERTISEMENT In Washington, the Obama administration was well aware how important cobalt was about to become to the global economy — and how dependent the Americans were on overseas sources. Top scientists and officials in seven federal agencies had spent two years interviewing industry experts, academics and researchers to identify essential raw materials that were vulnerable to shortages or interruption. Cobalt emerged in a White House report as among the most worrisome. Global demand was exploding because of its use in cellphone and laptop batteries. Domestic supply was negligible. Most cobalt was mined in Congo, the report pointed out, and China was starting to corner the market. A Growing Demand for Clean Energy Metals and Minerals Demand is expected to double by 2040 based on today’s policies. It could quadruple if countries meet their climate goals under the Paris Agreement. Chart shows projected growth by sector.

It also assumes countries meet other U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, including improving air quality and providing access to modern energy. By The New York Times Concerned about “China’s trade-distorting export restrictions on metals and minerals,” the group proposed that cobalt should be added to a list of so-called critical minerals to maintain “stable and flexible future supply chains for key emerging technologies.” ADVERTISEMENT The solution, the White House decided, was to create an “early warning” system to ensure the United States was alerted to threats to this supply. Now the alarms were sounding, and no one in Washington seemed to be listening. Rick Gittleman, a mining executive and lawyer who had worked at Freeport-McMoRan in Congo, alerted Gen. James L. Jones Jr., who had since left the Obama administration as a national security adviser. But he was unmoved. “There’s no one that’s going to be interested in that,” Mr. Gittleman recalled him saying. The general confirmed that account with The Times. The focus at the time for American diplomats in Congo centered on trying to urge President Joseph Kabila out of office. He had taken over after his father was assassinated in 2001 and spent much of the next 15 years looting millions of dollars from the public treasury. On a flight to the United States, Mr. Perriello was seated next to a Freeport-McMoRan executive after the company had announced the sale. He asked if there was anything the American government could do. With the company’s financial health on the line, there was a single-minded determination to close a deal, Mr. Perriello recalled. The company was not focused on the geopolitical repercussions of its choice, its own executives acknowledged. “We don’t currently have a mechanism to handle that discrepancy when it comes up,” Mr. Perriello said, “this gap between corporate interest and national interest.” ADVERTISEMENT The sale of Tenke Fungurume closed in November 2016, just a few weeks after Mr. Trump was elected president. It drew little attention in the United States outside the financial news media. Early in his administration, Mr. Trump signaled that challenging China’s efforts to dominate mineral supplies might be a major focus. His administration issued reports on cobalt and the potential for supply shortfalls, taking note of the Tenke Fungurume sale. Cobalt also made the Trump administration’s list of metals and minerals, first proposed in the Obama administration, that are deemed critical “to the nation’s security and economic prosperity.” Nonetheless, history repeated itself. Freeport-McMoRan still owned an undeveloped site deep in the forest that contains one of the world’s most important untapped sources of cobalt, a fact highlighted in the Trump administration’s document listing the element as a critical resource. When the company indicated late last year that it intended to sell the site, known as Kisanfu, there was next to no reaction from the U. S. government. State Department and Commerce officials said in interviews that there was no high-level discussion about it. ADVERTISEMENT “Nobody even talked about this,” said Nazak Nikakhtar, who until January served as the Commerce Department assistant secretary in charge of tracking critical mineral supplies. “It is horrible. I mean, this is really unfortunate.” The sale, to China Molybdenum for $550 million, went ahead as announced, a month before Mr. Trump left office. With it, the last major U.S. investment in Congo’s cobalt and copper mines evaporated. Eric Lipton reported from Washington, and Dionne Searcey from Fungurume.

" Three wildfires in California in the past 15 months killed or mortally wounded thousands of mature giant sequoias, accounting for an estimated 13 to 19 percent of the world’s population of the majestic trees, officials said on Friday. A National Park Service report estimated that two fires in September, sparked by a lighting storm, caused 2,261 to 3,637 mature giant sequoias — or between 3 to 5 percent of the population of mature giant sequoias — to be killed or so severely burned that they were expected to die within five years. Mature giant sequoias have a diameter of more than four feet. Giant sequoias, which are found on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada in California, can live thousands of years on their way to dwarfing most everything around them. These trees include iconic national treasures like the General Sherman Tree, which is considered the world’s largest tree, standing at 275 feet tall with a diameter of 36 feet at the base. The death of the trees in staggering numbers is the product of a “deadly combination” of unnaturally dense forests caused by fire suppression that began about 150 years ago and increasingly intense droughts driven by climate change, Clay Jordan, superintendent of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, said in an interview on Friday night. ADVERTISEMENT “That becomes a recipe for a catastrophic fire that threatens our sequoia groves, the health of our forests and, at the same time, threatens our communities,” he said. The mortality rates in the sequoias are unprecedented, he said. KNP Complex, one of the September fires, burned mostly within Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. The other, the Windy fire, burned in the Sequoia National Forest, the National Park Service said. The Castle fire, which began in August 2020, destroyed 7,500 to 10,600 large sequoias, park officials said, representing an estimated 10 to 14 percent of the entire Sierra Nevada population of large sequoias. Sequoias evolved to survive, and even thrive, in fires. But the ever-increasing intensity of fires in California has become too much for them. Experts say the fires that sequoias endured for centuries were mostly low grade. Thick bark and sky-high crowns protected the trees from serious damage. Heat from the flames even helped them reproduce by releasing seeds from their cones. ADVERTISEMENT But now, California’s sequoia groves are dealing with the consequences of fire suppression that has left forests thick with flammable vegetation. Drought and rising temperatures have killed other plants and turned them into kindling. From 2015 to 2020, two-thirds of the giant sequoia groves across the Sierra Nevada were scorched in wildfires, compared with a quarter in the previous century, according to the National Park Service. The latest wildfires this year led to fewer tree deaths partly because of emergency actions taken by firefighters, said Christy Brigham, chief of resources management and science for the Sequoia and Kings Canyon parks. This included backfiring operations, breaking and thinning around certain trees, and blanketing some sequoias, like the General Sherman, in protective wrap. “While these losses are not as stark and large as the Castle fire, they are still significant, unsustainable and are outside the range of historic fire effects on large sequoias,” Dr. Brigham said at a news conference on Friday. She also said that “climate change is a driving force in what we’re seeing, and we can’t fix climate change by ourselves.” The fires may have some beneficial effects in areas that burned at low intensity, including fuel reduction, small canopy openings ideal for regeneration, removal of litter and generation of ash — ideal conditions for sequoia seedlings, the park service said."
" CARMEL, Ind. — It’s getting harder and harder to run a stoplight here, because there are fewer and fewer of them around. Every year, at intersections throughout this thriving city, traffic lights and stop signs have disappeared, replaced with roundabouts. Lots and lots of roundabouts. There is a roundabout decorated with the local high school mascot, a greyhound and another with giant steel flowers. A three-mile stretch of Carmel’s Main Street has 11 roundabouts alone. The roundabout that locals perhaps prize the most features box hedges and a three-tier bronze fountain made in France. In 2016, it was named “International Roundabout of the Year” by no less than the U.K. Roundabout Appreciation Society, which, according to the Carmel mayor, Jim Brainard, is largely made up of “three guys in a pub.” (Their actual membership is six. But, still.) Carmel, a city of 102,000 north of Indianapolis, has 140 roundabouts, with over a dozen still to come. No American city has more. The main reason is safety; compared with regular intersections, roundabouts significantly reduce injuries and deaths. But there’s also a climate benefit. Because modern roundabouts don’t have red lights where cars sit and idle, they don’t burn as much gasoline. While there are few studies, the former city engineer for Carmel, Mike McBride, estimates that each roundabout saves about 20,000 gallons of fuel annually, which means the cars of Carmel emit many fewer tons of  planet-heating carbon emissions each year. And U.S. highway officials broadly agree that roundabouts reduce tailpipe emissions. ADVERTISEMENT They also don’t need electricity, and, unlike stoplights, keep functioning after bad storms — a bonus in these meteorologically turbulent times. “Modern roundabouts are the most sustainable and resilient intersections around,” said Ken Sides, chairman of the roundabout committee at the Institute of Transportation Engineers. The reason that Carmel has so many roundabouts is Mr. Brainard, the city’s seven-term Republican mayor. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Brainard first encountered roundabouts in the 1980s, when he studied at the University of Oxford and became taken with European traffic flow. After getting elected mayor in 1995, he asked a consultant to look into building a roundabout in Carmel. The consultant refused, saying they were dangerous and pointing to an effort in Massachusetts to remove them. But Mr. Brainard discovered that the consultant was confusing roundabouts with rotaries, or large traffic circles, which are bigger, arguably scarier and include Dupont Circle in Washington and Place Charles de Gaulle, the multilane beast around the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Modern roundabouts, by comparison, are compact, with lower speed limits, traffic yields rather than stops and generally fewer lanes. Unlike traffic circles where cars enter at 90-degree angles, traffic flows into modern roundabouts at a smaller angle, drastically cutting the chances of getting T-boned. Well-designed ones are also more friendly to pedestrians and cyclists. In 1997, Mr. Brainard oversaw the building of a roundabout on the city’s outskirts and added another two the following year. Locals, initially skeptical, warmed to them: They alleviated rush hour backlogs and stops. Within a decade, the city had close to 50, and doubled the number again over the next ten years. “Now we can’t live without them,” said Becky Blystone, a preschool teacher who also works at All Things Carmel, a souvenir shop on Main Street that sells roundabout-themed tchotchkes like drink cozies and playing cards. Outsiders took notice. In 2011, CNN did a segment, and the International Roundabout Conference came to town (topics, according to Mr. Brainard, included entrance and exit angles and sightlines). The city fanned the hype, issuing publications like “Roundabout Carmel: Highlighting City of Carmel Roundabouts from 1997 to 2010” (it features a “dogbone” shaped roundabout highway interchange dubbed the greenest in the country) and a glossy coffee table book, written by Mr. Brainard, called “Carmel: ’Round about Right.” It also celebrates National Roundabouts Week, which this year included trivia nights and Wear Your Roundabout Shirt to Work Day. “People love them here,” Mr. Brainard said during a recent tour of Carmel in his hybrid Ford Escape. “You couldn’t take one out.” ADVERTISEMENT Not everyone is a fan. “I hate them,” said Corey Hill, a call center director from nearby Avon who said he often gets stuck behind confused out-of-towners. Bill Greenman, operations manager at a restaurant downtown, said local sentiment often varied by mood. “If you’re having a wonderful day, you’ll probably just ignore them,” he said. “If you’re having a bad day in traffic, you’ll probably blame it on roundabouts.” Having greener intersections dovetails with Mr. Brainard’s climate mitigation efforts. He was among the thousands of leaders who pledged to uphold the Paris climate agreement when former President Donald J. Trump announced the American pullout in 2017. Carmel’s city vehicles are either hybrid or run by biofuels, green spaces sown with native plants have exploded in number and size, and solar panels help fuel the city’s water treatment and sewage plants. Under Mr. Brainard’s watch, the city has also added bike paths, taken out traffic lanes, widened sidewalks and increased walkability, all in an effort to get people out of their cars. “We need to do everything we can about carbon emissions and the climate change issue,” Mr. Brainard said. Carbon emissions per roundabout are highly dependent on location, construction, volume and time of day: A study of two roundabouts in Mississippi found a 56 percent decrease in carbon dioxide emissions; another calculated cumulative decreases at six roundabouts of between 16 percent and 59 percent. Carmel’s estimates are just that — the city engineer used calculations based on a study from Virginia. But overall, the Federal Highway Administration has found roundabouts cause fewer emissions compared to signalized intersections, and said the difference can be “significant.” ADVERTISEMENT “Just imagine a post-Sandy, post-Katrina or post-Andrew world where recovery funds were put to work building resilient, sustainable modern roundabouts instead of rebuilding fragile, polluting signalized intersections,” Mr. Sides, the traffic engineer, said. The United States has been slow to adopt modern roundabouts, though that is changing somewhat. By one count, they now number about 7,900 countrywide, with hundreds added each year. Still, hesitation remains. Mr. McBride, who, as Carmel’s city engineer for 13 years, oversaw the construction of nearly 80 roundabouts, said roundabout-curious municipal leaders often asked how to win over the public. “You can spit out fact-based data, but at the end of the day most of the general population is scared of things that are new and different,” Mr. McBride said. Roundabouts put decision making in the hands of drivers, unlike much of the U.S. roadway system, which, Mr. McBride said, “doesn’t put a lot of faith in the driver to make choices.” “They’re used to being told what to do at every turn,” he said. More than half of all serious crashes happen at intersections, according to the Federal Highway Administration, which has been pushing the construction of modern roundabouts for 20 years and provides funding for them through highway safety, congestion mitigation and air quality improvement programs. In the course of promoting roundabouts, Mr. Brainard visited Sarasota, Fla., in 2009, where he said he was met with a roomful of angry people. Among their fears: roundabouts were bad for pedestrians and would cause uneven wear on tires. But Mr. Brainard’s spiel about Carmel’s experiences evidently hit home. Sarasota now has a dozen roundabouts, with another in construction and five more planned, and just this year won the Innovative Roundabout of Merit Award. ADVERTISEMENT Locally, there’s been scrutiny. In 2019, an Indianapolis Star investigation undercut Mr. Brainard’s assertions that roundabouts were safer and more cost effective, reporting that, after Carmel transitioned to roundabouts, collision rates had jumped. Mr. Brainard disputed their findings, saying the Star hadn’t accounted for Carmel’s population explosion: The number of people living there had quadrupled since he took office, with daytime visitors adding to the load. A recent study of Carmel’s roundabouts by the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety found that injury crashes were reduced by nearly half at 64 roundabouts in Carmel, and even more at the more elaborate, dogbone-shaped interchanges. Andrea Bill, associate director of the Traffic Operations and Safety Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said roundabouts sometimes led to more fender-benders and sideswipes, but saved people from paying a greater price. “The thing I say to people is ‘would you prefer an ambulance or tow truck?’” Ms. Bill said. “Most people would say a tow truck.” Still, roundabouts take some getting used to. To that end, Carmel has published tips on its website, along with a roundabout map, and distributed hand-held plastic fans adorned with a roundabout diagram and instructions about where to yield (upon entering), what formation to drive in (staggered), and whether to stop (do not). Driving Carmel’s roundabouts on a recent fall day, a driver from Brooklyn found herself taken with all the dipsy-doodling that the cars of Carmel must do. There was something merry in all this going around, akin perhaps to dancing around the maypole, albeit in multi-ton vehicles that can cause injury or death. But to that point, vehicular fatalities in Carmel, according to a city study, are strikingly low; the city logged 1.9 traffic deaths per 100,000 people in 2020. In Columbus, Indiana, an hour or so south, it was 20.8. (In 2019, the national average was 11.) Ms. Blystone said people who visit the All Things Carmel shop often come in with differing opinions about the local roundabouts. ADVERTISEMENT For those who struggle, she said she offers the same advice. Take your time. And if they’re in doubt, just go around again. "
" CARMEL, Indiana — Cada vez es más difícil pasarse una luz roja aquí porque cada vez hay menos semáforos. Cada año, en las intersecciones de esta próspera ciudad, los semáforos y los avisos de alto han desaparecido para ser reemplazados por rotondas, esos pasos viales también llamados óvalos, glorietas o redondeles. Hay muchas muchas rotondas. Está la rotonda decorada con un galgo, la mascota de la secundaria local, y otra engalanada con enormes flores de metal. Solo un tramo de casi cinco kilómetros de la calle Main de Carmel tiene 11 rotondas. Tal vez la más apreciada por los habitantes sea una que tiene setos en forma de caja y una fuente de bronce de tres pisos hecha en Francia. En 2016 fue nombrada “Rotonda Internacional del Año” nada menos que por la Sociedad de Aprecio a las Rotondas del Reino Unido, organización que, según Jim Brainard, el alcalde de Carmel, está integrada en gran parte por “tres tipos en un pub”. (En realidad consta de seis miembros, pero igual). Carmel, una ciudad al norte de Indianápolis con unos 102.000 habitantes, cuenta con alrededor de 140 rotondas y se espera que próximamente se construyan unas diez más. La seguridad es la principal justificación para las glorietas porque, comparadas con las intersecciones normales, reducen de manera significativa las lesiones y las muertes. ADVERTISEMENT Pero también hay un beneficio para el clima. Como las rotondas modernas no cuentan con semáforos donde los autos se detienen y permanecen en ralentí, no consumen tanta gasolina. Aunque hay pocos estudios, el exingeniero de la ciudad de Carmel, Mike McBride, calcula que cada rotonda ahorra unos 20.000 galones de combustible al año, logrando que anualmente los autos de Carmel emitan casi 30 toneladas menos de emisiones de carbono que calientan al planeta. Y, en general, los funcionarios de carreteras de Estados Unidos coinciden en que las rotondas reducen las emisiones de los tubos de escape. Las rotondas tampoco requieren electricidad y, a diferencia de los semáforos, siguen funcionando incluso después de una fuerte tormenta, una ventaja en estos tiempos de turbulencia meteorológica. “Las rotondas modernas son las intersecciones más sustentables y resilientes que hay”, dijo Ken Sides, presidente del comité de rotondas del Instituto de Ingenieros de Transporte. La razón por la cual Carmel tiene tantas rotondas es Brainard, el alcalde republicano que ha gobernado la ciudad durante siete mandatos. ADVERTISEMENT Brainard se topó por primera vez con las rotondas en los años ochenta, cuando estudió en la Universidad de Oxford un semestre y se enamoró del poco tráfico europeo. Luego de ser electo alcalde en 1995, le pidió a un consultor que estudiara la posibilidad de crear una rotonda en Carmel. El consultor se negó, aduciendo que eran peligrosas y observó que en Massachusetts había un proyecto que proponía retirarlas. Pero Brainard descubrió que el consultor confundía las rotondas con una intersección circular mucho más grande y podría decirse más intimidante como la de Dupont Circle en Washington y la Plaza Charles de Gaulle, la bestia multicarril alrededor del Arco del Triunfo en París en la que convergen 12 calles. Las rotondas modernas, en comparación, son compactas, tienen límites de velocidad más bajos, ceden el tránsito en vez de detenerlo y por lo general consisten de menos carriles. A diferencia de las rotondas de tráfico donde los automóviles entran en ángulos de 90 grados, el tráfico fluye hacia las rotondas modernas en un ángulo más pequeño, reduciendo drásticamente las posibilidades de congestión vehicular. Además, las que están bien diseñadas son más amigables con los peatones y los ciclistas. En 1997, Brainard supervisó la construcción de una rotonda en las afueras de la ciudad y al año siguiente añadió otras dos. Los vecinos, escépticos al principio, rápidamente se acostumbraron: las nuevas intersecciones aliviaron los atascos de las horas pico y redujeron las paradas. En una década, la ciudad ya contaba con 50 y en los próximos diez años volvió a duplicar esa cantidad. “Ahora no podemos vivir sin ellas”, dijo Becky Blystone, una profesora de prescolar que también trabaja en All Things Carmel, una tienda de recuerdos que vende baratijas relacionadas con rotondas como portavasos, barajas y adornos colgantes. Los visitantes lo notaron. En 2011, CNN lo incluyó en un noticiero y la Conferencia Internacional de Rotondas se organizó en la ciudad (según Brainard, entre los temas que se discutieron había ángulos de entrada y salida y líneas de visión. La ciudad azuzó el furor y produjo publicaciones como Rotonda Carmel: Destaque de las rotondas de Carmel de 1997 a 2010 (en la portada aparece una rotonda de doble lágrima que ha sido calificada como la más verde del país) y un elegante libro de mesa, escrito por Brainard, titulado Carmel: ’Round about Right. También se celebra la Semana Nacional de la Rotonda, que este año incluyó noches de trivia, un día en el que se animó a la gente a vestir su camisa de rotonda al trabajo y el paseo ciclista inaugural. “A la gente de aquí les encantan”, dijo Brainard durante un recorrido reciente por Carmel a bordo de su Ford Escape híbrido. “No podrías quitar ninguna”. ADVERTISEMENT No todos aman las glorietas. “Las odio”, dijo Corey Hill, director de un centro de llamadas en Avon, una localidad cercana, quien dijo que a menudo se queda atrapado en el tráfico generado por los forasteros confundidos. Bill Greenman, gerente de operaciones de un restaurante en el centro, dijo que el sentimiento local a menudo variaba según el estado de ánimo. “Si estás teniendo un día maravilloso, probablemente las ignoras”, dijo. “Pero si tienes un mal día en el tráfico, probablemente le eches la culpa a las rotondas”. Tener intersecciones más verdes encaja con los esfuerzos de mitigación climática de Brainard. Él fue uno de los miles de líderes que prometieron respetar el Acuerdo Climático de París cuando el expresidente Donald Trump anunció que Estados Unidos se retiraría del pacto en 2017. Los vehículos del ayuntamiento de Carmel son híbridos o funcionan con biocombustibles, los espacios verdes con plantas polinizadoras nativas han aumentado en cantidad y tamaño y las plantas potabilizadoras y de tratamiento de aguas de la ciudad en parte funcionan gracias a paneles solares. Durante el mandato de Brainard, la ciudad ha incrementado las ciclovías, se han retirado carriles de tráfico, además de ampliar las aceras y mejorar la caminabilidad de la ciudad, todo como parte de un esfuerzo para que la gente salga de sus autos. “Necesitamos hacer todo lo que podamos en el tema de las emisiones de carbono y el cambio climático”, dijo Brainard. Las emisiones de carbono por rotonda dependen mucho de la ubicación, la construcción, el volumen y la hora del día: un estudio de dos glorietas en Mississippi halló un decremento de 56 por ciento de emisiones de dióxido de carbono; otro calculó las reducciones acumuladas en seis rotondas en cifras de 16 y 59 por ciento. Las estimaciones de Carmel son solo eso: el ingeniero de la ciudad empleó cálculos basados en un estudio de Virginia. Pero en general, la Administración Federal de Carreteras ha encontrado que las rotondas causan menos emisiones que otras intersecciones señalizadas e indica que la diferencia puede ser “significativa”. ADVERTISEMENT “Solo hay que imaginar un mundo post Sandy, post Katrina o post Andrew en el que los fondos de recuperación se emplearan en construir rotondas modernas, resilientes y sostenibles en lugar de reconstruir intersecciones señalizadas frágiles y contaminantes”, dijo Sides, el ingeniero de tráfico. Estados Unidos ha sido extremadamente lento en la adopción de rotondas modernas aunque eso está cambiando: ahora hay unas 7900 en todo el país y cada año se añaden cientos de ellas. Sin embargo, aún queda una profunda desconfianza. McBride, quien como ingeniero del ayuntamiento de Carmel durante 13 años supervisó la construcción de casi 80 de las rotondas locales, dijo que una de las primeras dudas que enfrentó de los líderes municipales que tenían curiosidad por las rotondas era cómo convencer al público. “Puedes escupir datos basados en hechos, pero al final del día la mayor parte de la población en general tiene miedo de las cosas nuevas y diferentes”, dijo McBride. Las rotondas dejan la decisión en manos de los conductores y obligan a cierto tipo de compromiso social: la gente tiene que prestar atención a los movimientos de otros choferes. Esto es muy distinto al modo en que funciona el sistema de carreteras estadounidenses, que es intensamente instructivo, a menudo repleto de señalizaciones y que, según dijo McBride, “no tiene demasiada fe en que el conductor tome decisiones”. “Están acostumbrados a que les digan qué hacer en cada esquina”, dijo. Más de la mitad de todos los choques serios suceden en intersecciones, según la Administración Federal de Carreteras, que ha estado impulsando la construcción de rotondas modernas durante 20 años y las financia a través de programas de seguridad en el camino, alivio a la congestión y mejora de la calidad del aire. Al promover las rotondas en distintas ciudades, Brainard visitó Sarasota, Florida en 2009, donde dijo que se topó con una sala repleta de personas molestas. Entre sus temores estaban que las rotondas eran malas para los peatones y causaban desgaste desigual en los neumáticos. Pero Brainard transmitió las buenas experiencias de Carmel que, obviamente tocaron una fibra sensible. Ahora Sarasota tiene más de una decena de rotondas, una en construcción y cinco más planeadas y este año ganó el Premio Internacional al Mérito en Rotondas. ADVERTISEMENT A nivel local se han producido cuestionamientos. En 2019, el Indianapolis Star publicó un reportaje de investigación que socavaba las aseveraciones de Brainard en cuanto a los beneficios de seguridad y costos; también informaba que, luego de que Carmel había transicionado hacia las rotondas, las tasas de choques se habían disparado. Brainard disputó los hallazgos, diciendo que el diario no había tomado en cuenta la explosión demográfica de Carmel: la cantidad de habitantes de la ciudad se cuadruplicó desde que él asumió la alcaldía, y ahora también hay un importante flujo de visitantes diarios que incrementan la carga vehicular. Un estudio reciente de las rotondas de Carmel a cargo del Instituto de Seguros de Seguridad Vial respaldó al alcalde al encontrar que los choques con lesionados habían caído a la mitad en las 64 rotondas de Carmel e incluso más en las estructuras viales más elaboradas. Andrea Bill, directora asociada del Laboratorio de Operaciones y Seguridad de Tránsito en la Universidad de Wisconsin-Madison dijo que algunas rotondas habían ocasionado un aumento de los accidentes menores, pero salvaban a las personas de un costo mayor. “Lo que yo le dijo a la gente es ‘¿prefiere una ambulancia o una grúa?’”, dijo Bill. “La mayor parte de la gente diría que una grúa”. Sin embargo, acostumbrarse a las rotondas toma tiempo. Por eso, Carmel ha publicado consejos en su página web, así como un mapa de rotondas, y ha distribuido abanicos de mano adornados con un diagrama de las rotondas e instrucciones sobre dónde ceder el paso (al entrar), de qué modo conducir (escalonado) y si hay que parar (o no). Recientemente, en un soleado día de otoño, una conductora de Brooklyn que recorría las rotondas de Carmel quedó absorta con todas las maniobras que los autos deben hacer. Había algo alegre en todo ese carrusel con vehículos de toneladas que pueden causar daños o la muerte. Pero, según un estudio de la ciudad, las fatalidades en accidentes vehiculares en Carmel son sorprendentemente bajas: el municipio registró 1,9 muertes en el tráfico por 100.000 habitantes en 2020. En Columbus, Indiana, una hora al sur, la estadística fue de 20.8 (En 2019, el promedio nacional fue de 11). Blystone dijo que quienes visitan la tienda All Things Carmel suelen tener opiniones distintas sobre las rotondas locales.

" When you open a can of chickpeas and fish out the nutty, savory little beans, you’re partaking in a history that began around 10,000 years ago. The modern chickpea’s ancestor, a wild Middle Eastern plant that likely had tiny, hard seeds, was cultivated by humans around the same time as wheat and barley, and began to evolve as early farmers selected plants whose seeds were larger and more succulent. Archaeologists have even found what appear to be domesticated chickpeas buried beneath Jericho in the West Bank, so deep that they would have been grown even before the inhabitants of one of history’s longest occupied cities began to make pottery. The humble chickpea has had a somewhat rocky road to its present popularity, however, suggests a new study published last week in Nature that sequences the genomes of more than 3,000 examples, making it one of the largest plant genome sequencing efforts ever completed. “I’m truly excited to see what else will be uncovered from this massive resource,” said Patrick Edger, a professor of horticulture at Michigan State University who was not involved in the study. The researchers now believe that after chickpeas were first domesticated in Turkey’s southeastern Anatolia region, their cultivation may have stagnated for millenniums. The result was a genetic bottleneck that makes all chickpeas today descendants of a relatively small group from a thousand years ago. What’s more, the modern varieties grown by most farmers are low in genetic diversity, which means that they are at risk of failing under the stress of climate change. By mapping the legume’s genetic makeup in such rich detail, the scientists hope to make it easier for plant breeders — who develop new kinds of crops — to bring diversity back into the chickpea’s genes, giving it a flexible tool kit to survive drought, flooding and diseases. ADVERTISEMENT While hummus may have become ubiquitous in American grocery stores only in the past 15 years, chickpeas have long been a staple crop in the developing world, said Rajeev Varshney, a research program director at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics in Hyderabad, India, as well as a professor at Murdoch University in Australia and an author of the new paper. India is the world’s largest producer of chickpeas, growing more than 10 million metric tons in 2019, as well as one of the largest importers. But chickpeas’ status as a developing world crop has meant that they have not received as much attention from breeders as commodities like corn, Dr. Varshney said. Chickpea farmers grow a handful of varieties that have been improved over the years without, for the most part, the benefit of genetic information that might give breeders more control over what traits the beans will have. In the present study, the researchers sequenced the DNA of 3,366 samples of chickpeas, ranging from wild relatives of the crop to modern stock. They identified a set of genes the plants had in common, as well as a wide variety of others, including some that scientists had not discovered before. These common genes are likely to handle the basic traits that all the plants share, while the unique genes, on the other hand, may encode special abilities like resistance to drought and protection from diseases. Going further, the researchers flagged sets of genes, some found in older varieties, that may prove helpful to modern chickpeas. The way plant breeding usually works, Dr. Varshney said, is that once a genetic trait, like resistance to a fungal disease, is brought into a given variety, all the individuals will have the exact same tool to block infection. That means that if a form of the disease evolves that can get past that defense, the results could be disastrous. ADVERTISEMENT “The whole crop — the whole field — will be wiped out,” Dr. Varshney said. Using the gene sets identified in this study, and making sure that many different sets are represented in chickpea populations, could be a protection against crop failures, he hopes. And he said that breeding more resilient chickpeas is a process that should start now, using genetic information to speed the process: If farmers wake up one day and find they need a chickpea that can thrive at 104 degrees Fahrenheit, “this would be very challenging,” said Dr. Varshney. “It needs to be incremental.” The study also peers into what the chickpea’s genes can tell us about its travels. The bean left the Middle East along independent routes to the Indian subcontinent and the land that borders the Mediterranean. And although patterns in its genes suggest a gradual decline in popularity for thousands of years, the scientists are not sure why that might have been. “Maybe farmers thought, this is not useful,” Dr. Varshney said. That changed about 400 years ago, when, according to the data, humans seem to have rediscovered the wonders of the chickpea, for reasons unclear to the researchers. Next time you dunk pita in hummus, you can be glad they did."
" The clean energy revolution is replacing oil and gas with a new global force: the minerals and metals needed in electric car batteries, solar panels and other forms of renewable energy. Places like the Democratic Republic of Congo, which produces two-thirds of the world’s supply of cobalt, for example, are stepping into the kinds of roles once played by Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich nations. And a race between China and the United States to secure supplies could have far-reaching implications for the shared goal of protecting the planet. An investigation by The New York Times drew on interviews with more than 100 people on three continents and thousands of pages of financial, diplomatic and other documents. Here are some of the findings. The American government failed to safeguard decades of diplomatic and financial investments it had made in Congo, even as China was positioning itself to dominate the new electric vehicle era. ADVERTISEMENT The sale, starting in 2016, of two major cobalt reserves in Congo by an American mining giant to a Chinese conglomerate marked the end of any major U.S. mining presence in cobalt in the country. Chinese battery makers have forged agreements with the mining companies to secure steady supplies of the metal. As of last year, 15 of the 19 cobalt-producing mines in Congo were owned or financed by Chinese companies, according to a data analysis. The companies had received at least $12 billion in loans and other financing from state-backed institutions, and are likely to have drawn billions more. ADVERTISEMENT The five biggest Chinese mining companies in Congo that focus on cobalt and copper mining also had lines of credit from Chinese state-backed banks totaling $124 billion. Players in the clean energy revolution are increasingly caught in a cycle of exploitation and greed over resources. At the center of it is the quest for a prized metal: cobalt, a key ingredient in electric cars. One of the government-backed companies, China Molybdenum, which bought the two American-owned reserves, described itself to The Times as “a pure business entity” traded on two stock exchanges. Records show 25 percent of the company is owned by a local government in China. The Congolese are reviewing past mining contracts with financial help from the American government, part of a broader anti-corruption effort. They are also examining whether Chinese promises to build roads, schools, hospitals and other infrastructure were kept. Separately, Chinese Molybdenum is being accused of withholding payments to the government at its Tenke Fungurume cobalt and copper mine. The company said it had done nothing wrong, and questioned if there was an organized effort to undermine it. China has an idiom that goes something like: “Where there is a will to condemn, evidence will follow,” a spokesman said. “Vaguely I feel that we may be caught in the gaming of greater powers.” Tenke Fungurume, one of the biggest cobalt mines in the world, was controlled by an American company, Freeport-McMoRan. Then it was sold in 2016 in a series of transactions worth $3.8 billion to China Molybdenum. The sale was aided by a Chinese private equity firm that bought out a minority owner in the mine. A founding board member of the private equity firm was Hunter Biden, son of the American president. A Washington company that had been controlled by Mr. Biden remains a shareholder in the firm, according to Chinese financial documents. Chris Clark, a lawyer for Mr. Biden, said his client “no longer holds any interest, directly or indirectly,” in the Washington and Chinese firms. Filings in China show he is no longer a board member of the Chinese firm. Mr. Biden did not respond to requests for comment. ADVERTISEMENT When asked if the president had been made aware of his son’s connection to the sale, a White House spokesman said, “No.” Increased mining and refining of cobalt by Chinese companies has helped meet the growing demand worldwide. But at least a dozen employees or contractors at the Tenke Fungurume mine told The Times that Chinese ownership had led to a drastic decline in safety and an increase in injuries, many of which were not reported to management. The company said that the complaints were probably fabricated, and that it had actually increased safety. As the world pivots to a future focused on electric vehicles, the United States is playing catch-up, though both Congress and the Biden administration are now making first steps. Legislation passed the House on Friday that would provide more than a half-trillion dollars toward shifting the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels to renewable energy and electric cars. Amos Hochstein, the State Department’s senior adviser for global energy security, predicts access to solar panels and electric vehicle batteries will determine energy security in the future. “It’s a national security imperative that the United States ensure the 21st century doesn’t repeat the vulnerabilities of the 20th century,” he said."

Before she married her husband, Kiersten Little considered him ideal father material. “We were always under the mentality of, ‘Oh yeah, when you get married, you have kids,” she said. “It was this expected thing.” Expected, that is, until the couple took an eight-month road trip after Ms. Little got her master’s degree in public health at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, N.C. “When we were out west — California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho — we were driving through areas where the whole forest was dead, trees knocked over,” Ms. Little said. “We went through southern Louisiana, which was hit by two hurricanes last year, and whole towns were leveled, with massive trees pulled up by their roots.” ADVERTISEMENT Now 30 and two years into her marriage, Ms. Little feels “the burden of knowledge,” she said. The couple sees mounting disaster when reading the latest climate change reports and Arctic ice forums. Anxiety about having children has set in. “Over the last year I thought, ‘Oh my God, I have to make a decision, it’s not that far away,” she said. “But I don’t know how I could change my mind. Over the next 10 years, I feel like there are only going to be more reasons to not want to have a kid, not the other way around.” Such fears are not necessarily unfounded. Every new human comes with a carbon footprint. In a note to investors this past summer, Morgan Stanley analysts concluded that the “movement to not have children owing to fears over climate change is growing and impacting fertility rates quicker than any preceding trend in the field of fertility decline.” There is much debate, however, over the idea that having fewer children is the best way to address the problem. In an interview with Vox in April, Kimberly Nicholas, a climate scientist and co-author of a 2017 study of the most effective lifestyle changes to reduce climate impact, said that population reduction is not the answer. “It is true that more people will consume more resources and cause more greenhouse gas emissions,” Ms. Nicholas said. “But that’s not really the relevant time frame for actually stabilizing the climate, given that we have this decade to cut emissions in half.” ADVERTISEMENT Nevertheless, the concern seems to be gaining traction. Among childless adults in the United States surveyed by Morning Consult last year, one in four cited climate change as a factor in why they do not currently have children. Another poll in 2018 by Morning Consult for The New York Times found that among young adults in the United States who said they had or expected to have fewer children than the number they considered ideal, 33 percent listed climate change, and 27 percent named population growth as a concern. While economic concerns remained paramount, with 64 percent citing the high cost of child care, 37 percent cited global instability and 36 percent, domestic politics. To some, those issues are all rolled together. In 2020, the birthrate in the United States declined for the sixth straight year, a dip of four percent believed to be accelerated by the pandemic. The trauma from nearly two years of coronavirus has also given some prospective parents pause. For Marguerite Middaugh, a 41-year-old lawyer in San Diego, Calif., the pandemic, coupled with climate-related devastation, prompted her to hold off on fertility treatments for a first child. “Seeing people not getting vaccinated, not taking care of their community,” she said. “That really made me pause about whether I want to bring a child into this world.” While spiraling housing costs, college-debt burdens, not to mention the so-called sex recession for millennials (the oldest of whom are now 40) factor into family planning for many, existential threats, too, are now part of the procreation calculus. ADVERTISEMENT A rise in political extremism, at home and abroad. A pandemic that has killed more than five million. Thousand-year floods that wiped out Western Europe towns. West Coast wildfires that grow more unimaginable in scale each summer. Faced with such alarming news, some prospective parents wonder: How harmful might it be to bring a child into this (literal and figurative) environment? To Jenna Ross, 36, a potter who lives near Fredericton in New Brunswick, Canada, her decision to remain childless in a world threatened by climate change springs from a protective instinct. “Harnessing the love I have for my unborn hypothetical kid comforts me in sparing them an inhospitable future,” she said. “In this way, my choice feels like an act of love.” Such views do not always travel across lines of geography, politics or social class —particularly since climate change is often painted as a partisan, not scientific, issue in the political arena. In the 2018 New York Times survey, the people who cited climate change as a reason to have fewer children were significantly more likely to be college-educated and Democrats, and slightly more likely to be white, nonreligious and high earners. Educated professionals also have greater access to abortion and birth control, and the economic means to choose either lifestyle course, although recent restrictions on abortion in Texas, for example, also complicate the procreation calculus. Regardless, such questions are creeping into the cultural dialogue in a manner that recalls the hippie-era “ecology” movement, when “The Population Bomb,” the seismic 1968 best seller by the Stanford University biologist Paul R. Ehrlich, predicted a barren, exhausted planet where hundreds of millions would die in famines during the 1970s. Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez both have broached the question in recent years, with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez asserting “a scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult,” in a 2019 Instagram Live, which leads “young people to have a legitimate question: Is it OK to still have children?’” ADVERTISEMENT Celebrities have also raised the issue. “Until I feel like my kid would live on an earth with fish in the water,” Miley Cyrus told Elle magazine two years ago, “I’m not bringing in another person to deal with that.” In an interview with Howard Stern in May, Seth Rogen discussed his decision with his wife to remain childless by choice: “There’s enough kids out there. We need more people? Who looks at the planet right now and thinks, ‘You know what we need right now?” Writers such as The New York Times columnist Paul Krugman and Katha Pollitt, the poet and essayist, have also chimed in recently. “Does the world need more people?” Ms. Pollitt wrote in an essay in The Nation this past June. “Not if you ask the glaciers, the rain forests, the air, or the more than 37,400 species on the verge of extinction thanks to the relentless expansion of human beings into every corner and cranny of our overheated planet.” While climate change is hardly a new concern, the worsening crisis has forced the issue for many prospective parents, said Josephine Ferorelli, a founder of Conceivable Future, an organization that hosts house parties for prospective parents to discuss how climate fears are shaping their reproductive lives. “Something happened this past summer,” Ms. Ferorelli said. “Three months ago, our inbox was empty. But in the past two months, we’ve been hearing from people all over the country who are upset and distraught.” ADVERTISEMENT No wonder some people who put off having children to pursue careers or other interests now wonder if the kindest thing for their unborn is to keep them that way. “I literally can’t go to a dinner party without the collapse of a civilization being at least mentioned, if not being the main topic of conversation,” said Myka McLaughlin, 40, who runs a company in Boulder, Colo., that helps women build profitable businesses. “Arable land is decreasing around the planet. We might not have enough food. We’ve lost 80 percent of the biomass in the ocean in the last century; the ocean is essentially dying.” Since college, Ms. McLaughlin has worried that humankind was on an unsustainable path. Even so, “at 27, I decided to have children and get married, in that order,” she said. Her first marriage, however, ended without children at 32. “He was a salt-of-the-earth farmer who wanted to live in the mountains,” she said. “I was a global citizen who wanted to travel and read The New Yorker.” By the time she entered a serious relationship in her late 30s, she was having grave doubts about bringing children into a troubled world. “His perspective was, we really need children who are well raised and well loved who can be leaders in our future for what is to come, which I think is a totally valid point,” Ms. McLaughlin said. She, however, now struggles to justify bringing a child into a world she fears may be on the brink. The couple broke up this summer. “When I see a beautiful young baby, my heart melts, just totally melts,” Ms. McLaughlin said. But at this point it might take a major life epiphany to change her mind. Political strife, both domestically and abroad, is also a factor for some. “With my past partner, we both decided that if Trump got re-elected in 2020, we were not going to engage in having children, primarily because the climate would be irreparable and probably extremely devastating,” said Hannah Evans, 33, a senior analyst for Population Connection, formerly Zero Population Growth, the prominent population-stabilization organization that Dr. Ehrlich helped found in the 1960s. ADVERTISEMENT Like many professional women, Ms. Middaugh, the lawyer in San Diego, put off having children through her 20s and 30s as she built her career and grappled with student loans. When she was around 36, however, she decided it was time to act. She and her husband had a difficult time conceiving, so they began fertility treatments shortly before the pandemic, when she was 39. Then came the lockdown. The fertility clinic closed for months. She had time to consider the world her child might face. Not only was she horrified by the lack of a unified response to coronavirus, but on a trip home to Alaska, she visited beaches that, as a child, she remembered teeming with starfish, otters and fat, briny mussels, but that now seemed denuded of wildlife. It was too much. She postponed her plans for IVF, although her husband is still pushing. “I’ve been asking myself, ‘If I don’t have a baby or at least really try, will I be sad or regret it forever?’” she said. “I don’t know, and can’t really know, but I don’t want to let that alone push me into making a choice to go ahead with trying.” Such questions are not confined to heterosexual women in monogamous relationships. Single women, husbands, gay couples, as well as people found on any point of the gender spectrum, all have the choice to procreate — and the choice not to. ADVERTISEMENT “As I think of it, having a child is like rolling dice with the child’s life in an increasingly uncertain world,” said Michael Ellsberg, 44, a writer in Berkeley, Calif. “Sure we might figure out how to limit global warming to 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius. We might figure out how to cooperate as a globe to prevent future pandemics. We might figure out how to limit the risks of nuclear war and terrorism. But we might not.” Mr. Ellsberg follows “The Exploring Antinatalism Podcast” and other such outlets, and after two breakups in which his desire to not have children was a major factor, he had a vasectomy to cement his decision. Doomsday fears are hardly the only reason that some choose the child-free lifestyle. “I was raised in a family that did not try to condition me as a girl-mommy-to-be,” said LiLi Roquelin, 41, a married, French-born singer-songwriter who lives in Queens. She counts herself a proud member of the so-called childfree by choice movement, celebrated on social media under hashtags like #childfree and #neverkids, and recently posted a self-penned anthem of sorts called “Childfree.” Even so, she said that women who choose not to reproduce often face intense social pressure from family, friends, even medical professionals. “Over the years, I have been criticized as inhuman or unloving,” she said. “In my mid-30s, my gynecologist kept telling me that my hormones would run out.” For her, such pushback is merely the price you pay. Ms. Roquelin said she enjoys a rich and fulfilling life without children, and is now studying for a master’s degree in business administration to capitalize on her music career. “I have many more things to explore on my journey,” she said, “that do not involve raising other suffering human beings on an out-of-supplies planet.”"
" Antes de casarse con su esposo, Kiersten Little lo consideraba un padre ideal. “Siempre vivimos con la mentalidad de casarnos y tener hijos”, relató. “Era algo esperado”. Es decir, algo que esperaban, hasta que la pareja hizo un viaje de ocho meses por carretera después de que Little obtuvo su maestría en salud pública de la Universidad de Carolina del Norte en Chapel Hill. “Cuando estuvimos en el oeste —California, Oregón, Washington, Idaho— condujimos por zonas en las que todo el bosque estaba muerto, los árboles derribados”, narró Little. “Pasamos por el sur de Luisiana, que fue azotado por dos huracanes el año pasado, y pueblos enteros habían sido arrasados, con enormes árboles arrancados de raíz”. ADVERTISEMENT Ahora, con 30 años de edad y dos de matrimonio, Little aseguró sentir “el peso del conocimiento”. La pareja ve el desastre creciente al leer los últimos informes sobre el cambio climático y los foros sobre el hielo del Ártico. La ansiedad respecto a tener hijos se ha hecho presente. “En el último año pensé: ‘Dios mío, tengo que tomar una decisión; no falta tanto tiempo’”, dijo. “Pero no sé cómo podría cambiar de opinión. En los próximos diez años, siento que solo habrá más razones para no querer tener un hijo, no al revés”. Estos temores no son infundados. Cada ser humano nuevo viene acompañado de una huella de carbono. En una nota dirigida a los inversionistas el verano pasado, los analistas de Morgan Stanley concluyeron que el “movimiento para no tener hijos debido a los temores sobre el cambio climático está creciendo y repercutiendo en los índices de fertilidad con más rapidez que cualquier otra tendencia anterior en el ámbito del descenso de la fertilidad”. Sin embargo, hay un debate intenso en torno a la idea de que tener menos hijos es la mejor manera de abordar el problema. En una entrevista con Vox en abril, Kimberly Nicholas, climatóloga y coautora de un estudio de 2017 sobre los cambios de estilo de vida más eficaces para reducir el impacto climático, dijo que la reducción de la población no era la respuesta. “Es cierto que más personas consumirán más recursos y producirán más emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero”, dijo Nicholas. “Pero en realidad ese no es el plazo relevante para estabilizar el clima de verdad, dado que tenemos esta década para reducir las emisiones a la mitad”. ADVERTISEMENT No obstante, la preocupación parece estar ganando adeptos. Entre los adultos sin hijos en Estados Unidos que fueron encuestados por Morning Consult el año pasado, uno de cada cuatro citó el cambio climático como una de las razones por las que no tienen hijos en la actualidad. Otra encuesta realizada en 2018 por Morning Consult para The New York Times reveló que, entre los adultos jóvenes de Estados Unidos que dijeron que tenían o planeaban tener menos hijos que el número que consideraban ideal, el 33 por ciento mencionó el cambio climático, mientras que el 27 por ciento mencionó el crecimiento demográfico como una preocupación. Aunque las preocupaciones económicas siguen siendo primordiales, pues un 64 por ciento citó el costo elevado del cuidado de los hijos, el 37 por ciento mencionó la inestabilidad global y el 36 por ciento, la política nacional. Para algunos, todas estas cuestiones van de la mano. En 2020, el índice de natalidad en Estados Unidos descendió por sexto año consecutivo, una caída del cuatro por ciento que se cree que se aceleró debido a la pandemia. El trauma de casi dos años de coronavirus también ha hecho reflexionar a algunos futuros padres. Para Marguerite Middaugh, una abogada de 41 años de San Diego, la pandemia, sumada a la devastación relacionada con el clima, la llevó a posponer los tratamientos de fertilidad para tener un primer hijo. “Ver que la gente no se vacuna, que no cuida de su comunidad”, dijo. “Eso realmente me hizo reflexionar sobre si quería traer un hijo a este mundo”. Aunque el aumento constante de los costos de vivienda y la carga de la deuda universitaria, por no hablar de la llamada recesión sexual de los milénials (los mayores ahora tienen 40 años), son factores que influyen en la planificación familiar de muchos, ahora las amenazas existenciales también forman parte del cálculo de la procreación. Hay un incremento del extremismo político, dentro y fuera de Estados Unidos; una pandemia que ha matado a más de cinco millones de personas; inundaciones sin precedentes que han arrasado con ciudades de Europa occidental; incendios forestales en la costa oeste del país que cada verano adquieren una escala más inimaginable. Ante noticias tan alarmantes, algunos futuros padres se preguntan: ¿cuán perjudicial puede ser traer a un niño a este entorno (en el sentido literal y figurado)? ADVERTISEMENT Para Jenna Ross, alfarera de 36 años que vive cerca de Fredericton, en New Brunswick, su decisión de no tener hijos en un mundo amenazado por el cambio climático surge de un instinto de protección. “El amor que siento por mi hijo nonato hipotético me reconforta lo suficiente como para evitarle un futuro inhóspito”, comentó. “De esta manera, mi decisión se siente como un acto de amor”. Estos puntos de vista no siempre se presentan en todas las líneas geográficas, políticas o de clase social (en particular porque el cambio climático a menudo se pinta como una cuestión partidista, no científica, en la escena política). En la encuesta de 2018 del Times, había más probabilidades de que las personas que mencionaron el cambio climático como una razón para tener menos hijos tuvieran educación universitaria y fueran demócratas, y una probabilidad ligeramente mayor de ser blancas, no ser religiosas y tener ingresos altos. Los profesionales con estudios también tienen mayor acceso al aborto y a métodos anticonceptivos, y los medios económicos para elegir cualquiera de los dos estilos de vida, aunque las recientes restricciones al aborto en Texas, por ejemplo, también complican la planificación familiar. Sea como fuere, estos temas se están colando al diálogo cultural de una manera que recuerda al movimiento “ecologista” de la época hippie, cuando La explosión demográfica, el radical éxito de ventas de 1968 de Paul R. Ehrlich, biólogo de la Universidad de Stanford, predijo un planeta estéril y sin recursos en el que cientos de millones morirían de hambre durante la década de 1970. El senador Bernie Sanders y la congresista Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez han abordado el tema en los últimos años. Ocasio-Cortez apareció en una transmisión en vivo de Instagram en 2019 afirmando que hay “un consenso científico de que la vida de los niños va a ser muy difícil”, lo que lleva a “los jóvenes a plantearse una pregunta legítima: ¿está bien seguir teniendo hijos?”. Los famosos también han planteado la cuestión. “Hasta que no sienta que mi hijo viviría en una tierra con peces en el agua”, dijo Miley Cyrus a la revista Elle hace dos años, “no voy a traer a otra persona para lidiar con eso”. En una entrevista con Howard Stern en mayo, Seth Rogen habló de la decisión que tomó con su mujer de no tener hijos: “Ya hay suficientes niños. ¿Necesitamos más gente? ¿Quién mira al planeta ahora mismo y piensa: ‘Sabes lo que necesitamos ahora mismo?’”. ADVERTISEMENT Escritores como el columnista de The New York Times Paul Krugman y Katha Pollitt, la poeta y ensayista, también lo han abordado recientemente. “¿Acaso el mundo necesita más personas?”, escribió Pollitt en un ensayo para The Nation en junio. “Si les preguntas a los glaciares, a las selvas tropicales, al aire o a las más de 37.400 especies al borde de la extinción gracias a la implacable expansión de los seres humanos en todos los rincones de nuestro sobrecalentado planeta, la respuesta es no”. Aunque el cambio climático no es un problema nuevo, el empeoramiento de la crisis ha influido en las decisiones de muchos posibles padres, señaló Josephine Ferorelli, fundadora de Conceivable Future, una organización que planifica reuniones para que padres potenciales hablen sobre cómo los temores relacionados con el cambio climático están dando forma a sus vidas reproductivas. “Algo sucedió el verano pasado”, dijo Ferorelli. “Hace tres meses, nuestra bandeja de entrada estaba vacía, pero en los últimos dos meses, hemos recibido mensajes de personas de todo el país que están afligidas y angustiadas”. No es de extrañar que algunas personas que aplazaron el nacimiento de sus hijos para dedicarse a sus carreras u otros intereses se pregunten ahora si lo más conveniente para sus hijos nonatos es mantenerse así. “Literalmente, no puedo ir a una cena sin que se mencione al menos el colapso de una civilización, a no ser que sea el tema principal de la conversación”, dijo Myka McLaughlin, de 40 años, que dirige una empresa en Boulder, Colorado, que ayuda a las mujeres a crear negocios rentables. “La tierra cultivable está disminuyendo en todo el planeta. Puede que no tengamos suficientes alimentos. Hemos perdido el 80 por ciento de la biomasa del océano en el último siglo; el océano se está muriendo”. Desde la universidad, a McLaughlin le preocupaba que la humanidad estuviera en un camino insostenible. Aun así, “a los 27 años decidí tener hijos y casarme, en ese orden”, dijo. Su primer matrimonio, sin embargo, terminó sin hijos cuando tenía 32 años. “Él era un agricultor que quería vivir en las montañas”, explica. “Yo era una ciudadana del mundo que quería viajar y leer The New Yorker”. ADVERTISEMENT Cuando empezó una relación seria, a finales de los 30, tenía serias dudas sobre la conveniencia de traer hijos a un mundo en problemas. “La perspectiva de él era que realmente necesitamos niños bien criados y bien amados que puedan ser líderes en nuestro futuro para lo que está por venir, lo que creo que es un punto totalmente válido”, dijo McLaughlin. Sin embargo, ella ahora lucha por justificar el traer un niño a un mundo que teme que esté al borde del abismo. La pareja rompió este verano. “Cuando veo a un hermoso bebé, mi corazón se derrite, se derrite por completo”, dijo McLaughlin. Pero en este momento podría ser necesaria una gran epifanía vital para que cambie de opinión. Los conflictos políticos, tanto a nivel nacional como internacional, también son un factor para algunos. “Con mi anterior pareja, ambos decidimos que si Donald Trump era reelegido en 2020, no íbamos a tener hijos, principalmente porque el clima sería irreparable y probablemente extremadamente devastador”, dijo Hannah Evans, de 33 años, analista principal de Population Connection, anteriormente Zero Population Growth, la prominente organización de estabilización de la población que Ehrlich ayudó a fundar en la década de 1960. Al igual que muchas mujeres profesionales, Middaugh, abogada de San Diego, pospuso la maternidad a lo largo de sus 20 y 30 años mientras construía su carrera y lidiaba con los préstamos estudiantiles. Sin embargo, cuando tenía alrededor de 36 años, decidió que era el momento de actuar. A ella y a su esposo les costaba concebir, así que comenzaron los tratamientos de fertilidad poco antes de la pandemia, cuando ella tenía 39 años. Entonces llegó el confinamiento. La clínica de fertilidad cerró durante meses. Tuvo tiempo para pensar en el mundo al que podría enfrentarse su hijo. ADVERTISEMENT No solo estaba horrorizada por la falta de una respuesta unificada al coronavirus, sino que, en un viaje a Alaska, visitó playas que, cuando era niña, recordaba repletas de estrellas de mar, nutrias y mejillones gordos y salados, pero que ahora parecían desprovistas de vida salvaje. Era demasiado. Aplazó sus planes de fecundación in vitro, aunque su esposo sigue presionando. “Me he preguntado: ‘Si no tengo un bebé o al menos lo intento de verdad, ¿me sentiré triste o me arrepentiré para siempre?”, dijo. “No lo sé, y no puedo saberlo realmente, pero no quiero dejar que solo eso me empuje a tomar la decisión de seguir adelante con el intento”. Estas cuestiones no se limitan a las mujeres heterosexuales con relaciones monógamas. Las mujeres solteras, los esposos, las parejas homosexuales, así como las personas que se encuentran en cualquier punto del espectro de género, todos tienen la opción de procrear, y la opción de no hacerlo. “Tal y como yo lo veo, tener un hijo es como tirar los dados con la vida del niño en un mundo cada vez más incierto”, afirma Michael Ellsberg, de 44 años, escritor de Berkeley, California. “Seguro que podemos averiguar cómo limitar el calentamiento global a 1,5 o 2 grados centígrados. Podríamos averiguar cómo cooperar como un planeta para prevenir futuras pandemias. Podríamos averiguar cómo limitar los riesgos de guerra nuclear y terrorismo. Pero puede que no”. Ellsberg sigue al pódcast The Exploring Antinatalism y otros medios similares, y tras dos rupturas amorosas en las que su deseo de no tener hijos fue un factor importante, se sometió a una vasectomía para consolidar su decisión. El miedo al día del juicio final no es la única razón por la que algunos eligen llevar un estilo de vida sin hijos. “Me crie en una familia que no intentó condicionarme como futura mamá”, dijo LiLi Roquelin, de 41 años, una cantautora casada y nacida en Francia que vive en Queens. Se considera una orgullosa integrante del llamado movimiento “childfree by choice” (sin hijos por elección), celebrado en las redes sociales con etiquetas como #childfree (#sinhijos) y #neverkids (#niñosjamás), y recientemente publicó una especie de himno de su autoría titulado “Childfree”. ADVERTISEMENT Aun así, dijo que las mujeres que deciden no reproducirse a menudo se enfrentan a una intensa presión social por parte de la familia, los amigos e incluso los profesionales médicos. “A lo largo de los años, me han calificado de inhumana o poco cariñosa”, relató. “A mis treinta y tantos años, mi ginecólogo me decía que se me acabarían las hormonas”. Para ella, esas críticas no son más que el precio que hay que pagar. Roquelin asegura que disfruta de una vida buena y plena sin hijos, y que ahora está estudiando una maestría en administración de empresas para lucrar con su carrera musical. “Tengo muchas cosas más que explorar en mi viaje, que no implican criar a otros seres humanos que sufren en un planeta sin recursos”, concluyó."
" WASHINGTON — The House on Friday passed a sprawling, roughly $2 trillion social policy, climate and tax measure that is the central pillar of President Biden’s domestic agenda. The product of months of intense negotiations, the package would bolster the federal safety net, enhancing support for children and families with child care subsidies and universal prekindergarten, expanding health coverage, increasing housing assistance and investing heavily in combating climate change. The measure is likely to change as it moves through the evenly divided Senate, where Republicans are unanimously opposed and Democrats cannot afford to lose even a single vote from their party. Here is where it stands coming out of the House. The bill would provide nearly $400 billion to help states build universal prekindergarten and affordable child care programs over six years. ADVERTISEMENT That includes an estimated $100 billion in funding for child care expansion and subsidies over the first three years, and similar spending levels for the duration of the program. The proposal is designed to ensure that the vast majority of families — those with four-person households earning up to $300,000 — spend no more than 7 percent of their income on child care. Families that earn under 75 percent of the state’s median income would pay nothing. The federal government would provide at least $18 billion, and unspecified spending levels for the duration of the program, to fund state programs that provide preschool programs for all 3-and 4-year olds. For the first three years, it would cover 100 percent of a states’ universal preschool expenditures, and in subsequent years would pay a percentage — 90 percent in year four, 75 percent in year five, and 60 percent in year six — in conjunction with states. The preschool spending also reserves $2.5 billion annually to increase the pay of staff in Head Start programs. The legislation would extend for a year the expansion of the Child Tax Credit included in the $1.9 trillion pandemic aid law enacted earlier this year. That provides monthly payments to about 35 million families, giving $300 per child under the age of 6 and $250 per child between ages 6 and 17. The bill also would create a new federal program to cover four weeks of paid family and medical leave, but that provision is likely to be dropped in the Senate, where it faces opposition from Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a crucial Democratic swing vote. — Erica L. Green The $555 billion for climate change programs is the single largest spending item in the broader bill, and would easily make it the largest climate change law in United States history. ADVERTISEMENT On its own, the bill will not be enough to fulfill Mr. Biden’s pledge to halve the United States’ emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. But it would get the country about one-third to halfway toward that target, according to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, an independent research organization. Once enacted, the bill could lower the United States’ greenhouse gas pollution by about a billion tons of carbon dioxide by 2030, the Rhodium analysis found — roughly the equivalent of taking all the cars in the United States off the road for one year. The centerpiece of the new climate spending is about $320 billion in tax incentives for producers and purchasers of wind, solar and nuclear power, inducements intended to speed up a transition away from oil, gas and coal. Buyers of electric vehicles would also benefit, receiving up to $12,500 in tax credits — depending on the portion of vehicle parts made in America, and whether it was built by union workers. There would be $1 billion to build electric vehicle charging stations, $2.9 billion to make the electrical grid more conducive to transmitting wind and solar power, and $12.5 billion in rebates for homeowners who install more energy-efficient appliances. And the bill would provide $55 billion to promote climate-friendly farming and forestry and research programs, $29 billion for a “green bank” program to help communities finance renewable energy projects and $10 billion to help rural electric cooperatives cover the cost of switching from coal plants to renewable energy. The House measure also includes a new fee on large oil and gas companies for leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. But that provision, too, could be weakened or removed given opposition by Mr. Manchin, whose state is one of the nation’s largest producers of natural gas. — Coral Davenport ADVERTISEMENT The legislation would patch numerous holes in the Affordable Care Act, bringing the nation closer to the Democrats’ goal of universal health coverage. The bill would extend generous subsidies that have lowered the cost of premiums for Americans who buy their own insurance. It would permanently extend a program that insures millions of children from low-income families, and would guarantee a year of Medicaid coverage for eligible women in the year after they have a child. In a provision aimed at vulnerable people without health coverage, it would offer comprehensive health coverage to poor adults who live in 12 states that have declined to expand their Medicaid programs, giving them subsidized access to private Obamacare plans. Several of these changes would expire after 2025, but millions more Americans would gain health coverage in the next few years. Older Americans would receive a number of new benefits. Medicare would begin covering hearing aids and audiology services in 2023. Medicare’s drug benefit would become more robust, lowering the total amount any patient would be asked to pay to $2,000 a year. And patients who need long-term care services would see new funding to enable them to receive that care at home, instead of a nursing home. The funding for home-based care is smaller than the president’s initial plan, however, and lawmakers jettisoned popular provisions that would have also added Medicare coverage for eyeglasses and dental care. For the first time, the government would be given the power to regulate the prices of certain prescription drugs. Medicare would be allowed to negotiate directly with drug makers over a subset of expensive drugs in the coming years. And drugmakers would be barred from raising the prices of their medicines by more than the rate of inflation. The drug price provisions are less aggressive than an original House proposal, but still expected to have substantial effects over time. — Margot Sanger-Katz The legislation would expand the homeland security secretary’s authority to grant a temporary status known as parole to undocumented immigrants who have lived in the country for a decade, providing them with work permits and shielding them from deportation. The work permits would last five years, and then would need to be renewed. The centerpiece of Biden’s domestic agenda. The sprawling $2.2 trillion spending bill aims to battle climate change, expand health care and bolster the social safety net. Here’s a look at some key provisions and how they might affect you: Child care. The proposal would provide universal pre-K for all children ages 3 and 4 and subsidized child care for many families. The bill also extends an expanded tax credit for parents through 2022. Paid leave. The proposal would provide workers with four weeks of paid family and medical leave, which would allow the U.S. to exit the group of only six countries in the world without any national paid leave. However, this provision is likely to be dropped in the Senate. Health care. The bill’s health provisions, which represent the biggest step toward universal coverage since the Affordable Care Act, would expand access for children, make insurance more affordable for working-age adults and improve Medicare benefits for disabled and older Americans. Drug prices. The plan includes a provision that would, for the first time, allow the government to negotiate prices for some prescription drugs covered by Medicare. Climate change. The single largest piece of the bill is $555 billion for climate programs. The centerpiece of the climate spending is about $320 billion in tax incentives for producers and purchasers of wind, solar and nuclear power. Taxes. The plan calls for nearly $2 trillion in tax increases on corporations and the rich. The bill also raises the cap on how much residents — particularly in high-tax blue states — can deduct in state and local taxes, undoing the so-called SALT cap. The proposal would include most undocumented immigrants who have lived continuously in the United States since before Jan. 1, 2011, and could help between 7 million and 8 million people. But significantly, the proposal does not create a new pathway to citizenship after such plans were disqualified under Senate rules. ADVERTISEMENT The current bill essentially codifies an enhanced version of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program introduced by President Barack Obama in 2012. Mr. Biden’s plan would also attempt to address the legal green card backlog, freeing up hundreds of thousands of visas dating back to 1992 that various administrations failed to use, and making them available for immigrants who are currently caught up in a bureaucratic morass. The plan also includes $2.8 billion for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to more efficiently evaluate and process migrants’ paperwork. — Luke Broadwater The measure includes the single largest investment in affordable housing in history, according to the Biden administration. It would provide $166 billion in housing aid, which includes building or preserving more than 1 million affordable homes and offering rental and down payment assistance. About $65 billion would address the backlog of public housing repairs and $25 billion would go toward rental assistance, mostly through the form of housing vouchers. The plan would also invest $15 billion in the creation of new rental homes for the lowest-income households. The proposal would also create a $10 billion grant program that would support access to affordable housing and improve mobility for low-income riders and residents of disadvantaged communities. Funds would be used to create new transit routes, expand service and repair facilities. — Madeleine Ngo The bill raises the cap on how much residents, particularly in high-tax states like New York, California and New Jersey, can deduct in state and local taxes. Undoing the so-called SALT cap, which is currently set to expire after 2025, has been a key priority for lawmakers from those states since it was imposed as part of the 2017 Republican tax law. ADVERTISEMENT The cap would rise from its current $10,000 limit to $80,000, and be extended through 2030 before reducing it back to $10,000 in 2031. The cap would then expire permanently in 2032. But it is likely to be changed in the Senate, where two key players, Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Bob Menendez of New Jersey, are discussing a separate agreement to eliminate the cap for families making up to at least $550,000 and impose it permanently for higher-income homeowners. The House bill also imposes new taxes on the wealthy and on corporations. Taxpayers with an adjusted gross income of more than $10 million would face an additional 5 percent tax on top of the 37 percent marginal tax rate they already pay. Those making more than $25 million would face an extra 3 percent surtax. Profitable companies with more than $1 billion in so-called book income — profits that firms report to their shareholders but not to the I.R.S. — that pay little to no corporate income tax would now be subject to a minimum tax of 15 percent. Big multinational companies would see the tax rate on their foreign earnings increase to 15 percent from 10.5 percent. — Alan Rappeport"
" RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil’s pledge this month to end illegal deforestation in eight years drew much praise from global leaders, but an official report this week cast doubt on that commitment after it showed that the rate of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest was at its worst in 15 years. At the United Nations climate conference in Glasgow, Brazil, intent on reversing its reputation as an environmental offender under President Jair Bolsonaro, joined over 100 countries in promising to end deforestation. Under the plan, Brazil said it would reduce deforestation in the Amazon by 15 percent by next year. But the report released on Thursday by Brazil’s National Institute of Space Research, or Inpe, showed that the world’s largest rainforest had lost an astounding 5,100 square miles of tree cover from August 2020 to July 2021. Satellite data indicated that deforestation increased by about 22 percent from the previous year. It was also the first time on record that the country has reported a fourth consecutive year of rising deforestation rates. Since Mr. Bolsonaro became president in 2019, the country has lost a forest area bigger than Belgium. ADVERTISEMENT “This is not surprising,” said Daniel Azeredo, a federal prosecutor who specializes in environmental crime. “The result of pulling apart Brazil’s environmental policy is deforestation.” Adding to questions over whether Brazil would meet those targets, the report was dated Oct. 27, four days before the climate summit, known as COP26, started, suggesting that the right-wing government had the information beforehand. But at a news conference late Thursday, Joaquim Leite, the minister of the environment, denied having any knowledge of the numbers during the climate summit, where he led Brazil’s delegation. “Maybe it was out of caution that Inpe delayed publishing this data,” he told reporters. “The information I have is that it was published today, and that this number is unacceptable.” Acioli de Olivo, the vice president of the union that represents space researchers working for the federal government, said his team had investigated the timing of the report’s publication. The report had been ready in mid-October, he said, and was uploaded to a government platform accessible to officials before the climate conference began. ADVERTISEMENT “It seems like a joke, saying they didn’t know about the report,” he said. Izabella Teixeira, a former minister of the environment in a left-wing government, said the episode not only reflected the current administration’s incompetence, but also that its pledges at the summit were only meant to do damage control. “Brazil can only follow its commitments when this government steps down,” she said. “We have completely run out of patience. There is no dialogue to be had.” Mr. Bolsonaro took office vowing to develop the Amazon region rather than protect it, which critics believe has severely damaged the country’s ability to attract investments and negotiate favorable economic deals on the international stage. With Mr. Bolsonaro running for a second term in an election set for next year, his policies undermining environmental protection agencies and encouraging miners and ranchers to occupy the Amazon are bound to come in sharp focus. A sharp economic crisis has pushed unemployment rates up and crushed his approval ratings in recent months. The new data was also released as the European Union and United States are discussing legislation that would prevent imports of goods linked to deforestation. If those laws are enacted under a Brazilian administration that is unable to control environmental violations, they could severely affect local agribusiness, the heart of the country’s economy. But if there is political will, Brazil has the tools to fulfill the commitments it made, said Marcio Astrini, who leads the Climate Observatory, an environmental protection organization in Brazil. From 2004 and 2012, deforestation rates dropped 80 percent. “It’s an eight-year job, that would be herculean work,” he said. “But we’ve done it before.”"
" WASHINGTON — The House narrowly passed the centerpiece of President Biden’s domestic agenda on Friday, approving $2.2 trillion in spending over the next decade to battle climate change, expand health care and reweave the nation’s social safety net, over the unanimous opposition of Republicans. The bill’s passage, 220 to 213, came after weeks of cajoling, arm-twisting and legislative legerdemain by Democrats. It was capped off by an exhausting, circuitous and record-breaking speech of more than eight hours by the House Republican leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, that pushed a planned Thursday vote past midnight, then delayed it to Friday morning — but did nothing to dent Democratic unity. Groggy lawmakers reassembled at 8 a.m., three hours after Mr. McCarthy finally abandoned the floor, to begin the final series of votes to send one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in half a century to the Senate. ADVERTISEMENT “Under this dome, for centuries, members of Congress have stood exactly where we stand to pass legislation of extraordinary consequence in our nation’s history and for our nation’s future,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, adding that the act “will be the pillar of health and financial security in America.” The sprawling social spending and climate package passed with the support of all but one Democrat and no Republicans. The bill still has a long and difficult road ahead. Democratic leaders must coax it through the 50-50 Senate and navigate a tortuous budget process that is almost certain to reshape the measure and force it back to the House — if it passes at all. But even pared back from the $3.5 trillion plan that Mr. Biden originally sought, the legislation could prove as transformative as any since the Great Society and War on Poverty in the 1960s, especially for young families and older Americans. The Congressional Budget Office published an official cost estimate on Thursday afternoon that found the package would increase the federal budget deficit by $160 billion over 10 years. “It puts us on the path to build our economy back better than before by rebuilding the backbone of America: working people and the middle class,” Mr. Biden said in a statement. He urged the Senate to swiftly pass the measure. ADVERTISEMENT The assessment indicated that the package overall would cost slightly more than Mr. Biden’s latest proposal — $2.2 trillion rather than $1.85 trillion. Republicans, who have railed for months against the measure as a costly initiative that would steer the nation toward socialism, wasted little time in promising to try to weaponize it against Democrats in next year’s midterm elections. “This bill would worsen inflation by pumping trillions of dollars in wasteful spending into the economy, give tax cuts to the wealthy, hike taxes on middle-class families and add hundreds of billions to the national debt,” Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chairwoman, said in a statement that derided the bill, which Mr. Biden has called the Build Back Better Act, as “Build Back Broke.” “Americans will see through their lies, and the R.N.C. will make sure voters don’t forget the Democrats’ failures come next November,” Ms. McDaniel said. The bill offers universal prekindergarten, generous subsidies for child care that extend well into the middle class, expanded financial aid for college, hundreds of billions of dollars in housing support, home and community care for older Americans, a new hearing benefit for Medicare and price controls for prescription drugs. More than half a trillion dollars would go toward shifting the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels to renewable energy and electric cars, the largest investment ever to slow the warming of the planet. The package would largely be paid for with tax increases on high earners and corporations, estimated to bring in nearly $1.5 trillion over 10 years. Savings in government spending on prescription drugs are projected to bring in another $260 billion. ADVERTISEMENT The fact that the bill could slightly add to the federal deficit did not dissuade House Democrats from voting for it, in part because the analysis boiled down to a dispute over a single line item: how much the I.R.S. would collect by cracking down on people and companies that dodge large tax bills. The legislation is a key piece of Mr. Biden’s domestic policy agenda, paired with a $1 trillion infrastructure package that the president signed into law this week. Its path to Friday’s vote was arduous, from midsummer to deep autumn, with negotiations pitting liberal lawmakers against centrists and House Democrats against senators. And from the beginning, Republicans — who made it clear they could never support a package of the scope and ambition Mr. Biden had proposed — were cut out of the talks. While some Republicans voted for the infrastructure measure, they unanimously opposed the social safety net package, arguing that it would constitute a dangerous encroachment of the federal government into every aspect of American life, and would exacerbate rising costs across the country. A spokeswoman for the Republicans’ House campaign arm said Democrats “seem intent on destroying our economy before they lose the majority.” And in the Senate, party leaders were openly pressuring Democratic senators to tank their party’s marquee legislation. “Only a few Senate Democrats can protect American families from these radical and painful policies,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader. “It is up to them to kill this bill.” It was Mr. McCarthy, the top Republican in the House, who made a futile last stand against the measure in that chamber, taking advantage of what is known as the “magic minute” — a custom that allows party leaders to speak without time constraints when they are granted their minute of floor time. ADVERTISEMENT He held the floor well into Friday morning, railing for more than eight hours against the bill and the Biden administration, breaking the record for the longest continuous House speech in modern history set by Ms. Pelosi in 2018 before he concluded at 5:10 a.m. Some Democrats pointedly walked out before he began to speak, and at times interrupted his speech against the bill with boos, heckles and jeers. “Every page of all this new Washington spending shows just how irresponsible and out of touch the Democrats are to the challenges that America faces today,” Mr. McCarthy said during his speech, which appeared intended to rally his Republican base behind a message for the midterm elections and burnish his own bid for speaker should his party prevail. But just hours later, Democrats filed into the chamber, joking about the lack of sleep and ready to vote. And if Democrats feared the political consequences, it was not evident from the final tally, which reflected support among those from the most competitive districts. As the vote tally ticked past 218, Democrats began hugging and dancing in the aisles of the House chamber, chanting “Build Back Better.” Once Ms. Pelosi banged the gavel to signal the end of the vote, lawmakers swarmed her on the House floor, yelling her name and cheering, as Republicans sat expressionless across the room. The centerpiece of Biden’s domestic agenda. The sprawling $2.2 trillion spending bill aims to battle climate change, expand health care and bolster the social safety net. Here’s a look at some key provisions and how they might affect you: Child care. The proposal would provide universal pre-K for all children ages 3 and 4 and subsidized child care for many families. The bill also extends an expanded tax credit for parents through 2022. Paid leave. The proposal would provide workers with four weeks of paid family and medical leave, which would allow the U.S. to exit the group of only six countries in the world without any national paid leave. However, this provision is likely to be dropped in the Senate. Health care. The bill’s health provisions, which represent the biggest step toward universal coverage since the Affordable Care Act, would expand access for children, make insurance more affordable for working-age adults and improve Medicare benefits for disabled and older Americans. Drug prices. The plan includes a provision that would, for the first time, allow the government to negotiate prices for some prescription drugs covered by Medicare. Climate change. The single largest piece of the bill is $555 billion for climate programs. The centerpiece of the climate spending is about $320 billion in tax incentives for producers and purchasers of wind, solar and nuclear power. Taxes. The plan calls for nearly $2 trillion in tax increases on corporations and the rich. The bill also raises the cap on how much residents — particularly in high-tax blue states — can deduct in state and local taxes, undoing the so-called SALT cap. The only Democrat who opposed the bill, Representative Jared Golden of Maine, did so after raising concerns this month about the inclusion of a provision that would generously increase the federal tax deduction for state and local taxes paid, from $10,000 a year to $80,000. But he suggested in a series of statements on Twitter that his vote could still be won with changes to the so-called SALT proposal and other possible tweaks once it reaches the Senate. The action — after months of time-consuming maneuvering over the bill — was fueled in part by an eagerness among lawmakers to wrap up their work and leave Washington for their weeklong Thanksgiving recess. It came about eight months after Mr. Biden unveiled the first part of his domestic policy agenda, and after several near-death experiences for the package that have exposed deep divisions within his party. The vote showed remarkable Democratic unity, given the struggle to get to it. A group of moderate and conservative holdouts, wary about the size of the bill, had held out for an official estimate before they would commit to supporting it. ADVERTISEMENT But after the release on Thursday of section-by-section assessments from the Congressional Budget Office, the official fiscal scorekeeper, most were swayed. White House officials met privately with the group Thursday evening to walk them through the administration’s analysis and the budget tables, according to a person familiar with the discussion. For Democrats, the bill is perhaps the last significant opportunity to push through their domestic policy ambitions: an array of environmental provisions, federal support for education and child care, and the fulfillment of a longtime campaign promise to tackle the soaring cost of prescription drugs. “Now, it’s going to be just telling our story — that’s the challenge,” said Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, as staff members carried fresh cups of coffee into his ceremonial office. The legislation is all but guaranteed to change in the Senate, where two Democratic centrists, Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have yet to explicitly endorse it. In an evenly divided Senate, a single defection could sink its passage, and Democrats will have to maneuver the bill through their own internal divisions and a rapid-fire series of politically difficult amendments that could upend the bill. At a celebratory news conference with top Democratic leaders, Ms. Pelosi downplayed the extent of possible changes and vowed that “at the end of the day, we will have a great bill.” Democrats must also ensure that the entire plan adheres to the strict rules that govern the reconciliation process and force the removal of any provision that does not have a direct fiscal effect. Those rules have already forced the party to abandon a plan to provide a path to citizenship in the bill for undocumented immigrants. ADVERTISEMENT The Senate parliamentarian, the arbiter of those rules, has yet to issue guidance for their latest proposal to provide temporary protection from deportation for millions of migrants who are long-term residents of the United States. Other elements of the plan may also shift because of objections from individual senators. Mr. Manchin, in particular, has raised a variety of concerns, including to four weeks of federal paid family and medical leave and a push to include a fee on emissions of methane, a powerful pollutant. And some liberals have rejected the House provision to generously increase the federal tax deduction for state and local taxes paid, which would primarily benefit wealthy homeowners who itemize their deductions. Instead, they and other senators are discussing an income limit to curtail who could take advantage of the increased deduction. While some Democrats have publicly complained about its inclusion, several lawmakers from high-tax states like New York and New Jersey had established it as a requirement for their votes. Democratic leaders have suggested that the Senate would move to pass the legislation before the end of the year, despite a number of other pressing fiscal deadlines piling up in December. “We will act as quickly as possible to get this bill to President Biden’s desk and deliver help for middle-class families,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, in a statement.

" WASHINGTON — The United States took a major step toward fighting climate change Friday with passage through the House of Representatives of a $2.2 trillion spending bill that includes the largest expenditures ever made by the federal government to slow global warming. The legislation provides $555 billion for programs that could significantly curb the fossil fuel emissions that have been heating the atmosphere, fueling deadly and record-breaking wildfires, floods, heat waves and drought. However, the bill faces an uncertain path through the Senate and negotiations between the two chambers may change its form. On its own, the legislation isn’t enough to fulfill President Biden’s pledge that the United States will cut its emissions by half from 2005 levels by the end of this decade. But it goes well beyond any other climate policy that has come before it, in the United States and in most other countries. It features tax incentives to cut the costs to consumers and manufacturers of electric vehicles, electric heat pumps, solar panels, wind farms and other equipment designed to power the economy without pollution. ADVERTISEMENT “The science is clear, we only have a brief window left before us to raise our ambitions and to raise to meet the task that’s rapidly narrowing,” said Mr. Biden at a global climate summit earlier this month. “But ladies and gentlemen, within the growing catastrophe, I believe there’s an incredible opportunity. Not just for the United States, but for all of us. We’re standing at an inflection point in world history, we have the ability to invest in ourselves and build an equitable clean energy future.” Environmental groups said the legislation would begin to address a climate crisis that is no longer a distant threat. “It’s here now,” said Abigail Dillen, president of Earthjustice. “And we need bold action from our government to deploy the clean technologies and natural solutions that will carry every community, including those that have too long borne the brunt of pollution and climate catastrophe, into a safe and vibrant future.” But the fossil fuel industry said the policies would punish American firms while helping foreign competitors. ADVERTISEMENT Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, which represents offshore drilling companies, called the oil and gas provisions  “a gift to higher emitting producers like Russia and China that wield their energy resources as a geopolitical tool.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 220 to 213, with one Democrat joining every Republican in opposition. Its passage follows Mr. Biden’s signing on Monday of a separate $1.2 trillion infrastructure package that included about $50 billion to help fortify communities against the impacts from global warming. Last week in Glasgow, the United States joined about 200 countries in an agreement to intensify efforts to keep average global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, compared with preindustrial levels. Past that threshold, scientists have warned, the risk of deadly heat waves, destructive storms, water scarcity and ecosystem collapse grows immensely. The world has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius. “This bill makes it happen for us in terms of preserving the planet,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. “It’s a health issue: clean air, clean water for our children. It’s a jobs issue: making America pre-eminent in good-paying green jobs. It’s also a national security issue, because competition for habitat and, and resources resulting from drought and, you know, all of the challenge of natural disasters springing from the climate crisis. And, it is a moral issue, if you believe as I do that this is God’s creation and we have a moral obligation to be good stewards.” Historically, the United States is the country that has pumped the most carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. It is currently the second biggest polluting country, behind China. A major scientific report issued in August concluded that countries must immediately shift away from burning fossil fuels to avoid a harrowing future. Republicans assailed the climate provisions. “This includes payoffs for electric vehicle owners,” said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the ranking Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. “It includes higher taxes on American energy and higher prices for consumers.” In an eight-hour attack on the bill on the House floor, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican Leader, said, “Every moment you heat your home in the winter or cool it in the summer, you will pay more. That alone is enough reason to defeat the bill — defeat the bill!” ADVERTISEMENT Climate change is the single largest spending category of the new legislation, which also encapsulates the rest of Mr. Biden’s broader domestic agenda. One-quarter of the bill — $555 billion to be spent over the next decade — is devoted to pulling the American economy away from its 150-year-old reliance on fossil fuels and toward clean energy sources. By comparison, the largest amount previously spent by the federal government to combat climate change was about $80 billion, in the 2009 economic stimulus package signed into law by former President Barack Obama. Mr. Obama also put in place the nation’s first major climate change regulations, but they were later weakened or erased by the Trump administration. Once enacted, the new legislation could prevent emissions of about one billion tons of carbon dioxide by 2030, according to an analysis by Rhodium Group, an independent research organization. That’s the equivalent of taking roughly all the cars in the United States off the road for one year. But it would bring the country only about halfway to Mr. Biden’s goal, the analysis found. “With passage of this bill, Biden will have made an outstanding accomplishment which can get the U.S. part of the way there,” said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University. The centerpiece of the new climate legislation is $320 billion in tax incentives for producers and buyers of wind, solar and nuclear power. Buyers of electric vehicles would receive up to $12,500 in tax credits, depending on what portion of the vehicle parts were made in America and whether they were built by union workers. The legislation provides funds to create charging stations for electric vehicles and update the electric grid to accommodate transmission of wind and solar power, as well as money for climate-friendly farming and forestry programs. ADVERTISEMENT The bill would ban new oil and gas leases off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and off the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, and repeal the fossil fuel leasing program in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, while authorizing wind farms in federal waters in the Atlantic Ocean and Eastern Gulf of Mexico. It would increase the royalties paid by oil companies that drill on federal lands, while reinstating a tax on imported petroleum products. It would also create a fee on leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that frequently escapes from oil and gas wells. And it includes a suite of programs designed to help low income and minority communities that are disproportionately harmed by environmental problems, from $15 billion to finance clean energy projects to $2.83 billion to plant trees in poor neighborhoods that can be 10 degrees hotter than leafier sections of a city. Analysts agreed that of all the climate provisions, the tax credits would be the most impactful in terms of lowering emissions. The centerpiece of Biden’s domestic agenda.

The plan calls for nearly $2 trillion in tax increases on corporations and the rich. The bill also raises the cap on how much residents — particularly in high-tax blue states — can deduct in state and local taxes, undoing the so-called SALT cap. “This is a fundamental shift in tax policy,” said Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, and the chief author of the tax provisions. “What makes this landmark legislation is that, for the first time, you would have, in the tax arena, a clear statement that the bigger your carbon reduction, the bigger your tax incentives.” Most of the incentives are 10-year extensions of existing tax credits. In the past, those credits have expired after one to five years, and they often lapse before they are renewed. “Some of them had a shelf life barely longer than a carton of eggs,” Mr. Wyden said. Extending them for a decade, he added “provides certainty and predictability to the clean energy producers.” ADVERTISEMENT The decision by Democratic leaders to use the tax code as their primary weapon to fight climate change was determined by both political necessity and economic research. With Republicans unanimously opposed to the broader spending bill, Democrats are pushing the measure through Congress under a special process known as reconciliation, which would enable Democrats to pass the legislation in the Senate on a simple majority vote, without any Republican support. To meet the rules of reconciliation, any new climate program needed to take the form of a budget or tax policy. Economists say the most effective way to cut emissions is to tax them, essentially driving up costs for polluters. Another way, though less efficient, is to create incentives for using less-polluting sources of energy, essentially a reward for choosing wind, solar or nuclear energy. Democrats had hoped to combine both methods in a carrot-and-stick approach: penalties for burning fossil fuels and incentives for clean energy. In writing the legislation, Democrats abandoned what experts said would be one of the most powerful tools to cut emissions: a program that would have rewarded utilities that drew an increasing share of electricity from clean energy sources, and penalized those that did not. That plan hit a roadblock in the form of Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, whose home state is a major producer of coal and gas, and whose vote is essential to passage of the legislation in the Senate. Mr. Manchin’s state produces coal and natural gas and he has personal financial ties to the coal industry. He has forcefully objected to any program that would hurt fossil fuels. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Manchin has opposed other climate provisions in the legislation, including the fee on methane, and the tax incentives for purchasing union-made electric vehicles. Environmental activists are focused on Mr. Manchin ahead of the Senate negotiations. This month, about 100 people gathered outside the houseboat where Mr. Manchin stays when in Washington. As the senator exited the adjacent yacht club, demonstrators trailed him to his car, chanting, “We want to live! We want to live!” “The fight is definitely not over,” said Audrey Lin, a 20-year-old protester from Watertown, Mass. “We’re definitely going to be keeping up the pressure on Manchin and Biden and making sure the Democratic Party delivers the promises that we elected them on.” Lisa Friedman contributed reporting."
" WASHINGTON — House Democrats delayed plans to pass their $1.85 trillion social policy and climate change bill until Friday morning as the top Republican in the chamber held up the floor with a record-breaking speech railing against President Biden and his agenda. Party leaders remained confident they had the votes to pass the legislation, after a final cost estimate appeared to assuage centrist holdouts, and as a weeklong Thanksgiving recess beckoned. But shortly after midnight Friday, with Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, showing no sign of yielding control of the House floor, Democratic leaders sent lawmakers home, with plans to return at 8 a.m. to finish debate and vote on the sprawling package. “I don’t know if they think because they left, I’m going to stop,” Mr. McCarthy vowed, as the Republicans seated behind him applauded. “I’m not.” Yielding the floor shortly after 5 a.m., he spoke for eight hours and 32 minutes. It was the longest continuous House speech in modern history, surpassing one by Representative Nancy Pelosi of California in 2018. ADVERTISEMENT Now the Speaker, Ms. Pelosi had professed optimism that the House could pass the package Thursday, a prospect that seemed likely until Mr. McCarthy took the microphone at 8:38 p.m. Democrats have been eager to pass the measure — the broadest intervention in the nation’s social safety net in 50 years and by far the largest effort ever to combat climate change — after months of painful intraparty negotiating, and only one of their party, Representative Jared Golden of Maine, has publicly said he will oppose it. But Mr. McCarthy successfully prolonged a debate that had been scheduled to last 20 minutes, delivering a dilatory, at times rambling, speech stuffed with Republican talking points against the legislation and a Democratic-controlled Washington, punctuated with riffs about history and taunts against the majority party. For Mr. McCarthy, it appeared intended to gin up a Republican base eager to take back control of the House in 2022 and to assert himself as a leader shaping his party’s message, cycling through issues including inflation and gas prices, border security, the chaotic withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and what he called an out-of-control Democratic majority. “I know some of you are mad at me, think I spoke too long,” he said, needling Democrats. “But I’ve had enough. America has had enough.” While the House has no equivalent to the Senate filibuster, Mr. McCarthy used the so-called “magic minute” — a custom that allows House leaders to speak for as long as they want during floor debate. Ms. Pelosi famously used the tactic when she was minority leader in 2018, speaking for just over eight hours about the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. ADVERTISEMENT It was reminiscent of former Representative John A. Boehner’s famous speech in opposition to the Affordable Care Act in 2010, where he denounced the bill with a fiery “Hell no!” and rallied his restive minority behind his leadership. But while Mr. Boehner’s speech lasted for a few minutes, Mr. McCarthy blew past what his office said was his previous longest House floor speech of 20 minutes and 17 seconds. At times his voice grew hoarse as he volleyed between outraged condemnation and conversational musing. He expounded on grievances beyond the sprawling climate, tax and spending provisions in the package, meandered through a range of personal anecdotes and lashed out against changes to House rules that enable proxy voting, as increasingly frustrated and angry Democrats booed and heckled him from the back of the chamber. “It is a feat of epic proportions to speak for four hours straight and not produce a single memorable phrase, original insight or even a joke,” Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, wrote on Twitter. “McCarthy thinks he is a wit but so far he has proved he is only half right.” While Mr. McCarthy denied them a triumphant vote Thursday, Democratic aides noted that an early morning vote could guarantee a full day of news media coverage. Ms. Pelosi’s office instead circulated news releases declaring “McCarthy Needs a Reality Check” and wondering “Is Kevin McCarthy OK?” Ms. Pelosi is expected to deliver her own speech before the House votes on Friday. “It’s pretty exciting. This is historic; it is transformative,” Ms. Pelosi said on Thursday morning. In a letter to the caucus, she described the legislation as “a spectacular agenda for the future.” If all but three Democrats remain united, Republicans are powerless to prevent the House from passing the plan, which they have long refused to support because of its scope and scale. Because the bill is being considered under special rules known as reconciliation that shield it from a filibuster in the Senate, Democrats have bypassed Republican input and relied instead on their razor-thin majorities in both chambers to craft the package. The Congressional Budget Office published an official cost estimate on Thursday afternoon that found the package would increase the federal budget deficit by $160 billion over 10 years. The package would largely be paid for with tax increases on high earners and corporations, estimated to bring in nearly $1.5 trillion over 10 years. ADVERTISEMENT A group of moderate and conservative holdouts repeatedly delayed a vote on the package, citing concerns about its cost and insisting on an official estimate before they would commit to supporting it. But the release on Thursday of section-by-section assessments from the Congressional Budget Office, the official fiscal scorekeeper, appeared to sway most. Democrats, who have stuffed the bill with long-desired priorities and policy changes, took turns highlighting the bill’s array of environmental provisions, an expansion of health care and support for education and child care. Ms. Pelosi talked up the areas of agreement that Democrats had reached in both the House and Senate: universal prekindergarten, generous assistance with child care costs, prescription drug price controls and home health care for older Americans. If the bill passes the House, it faces a difficult road in the Senate, where Republicans will have a clear shot to offer politically difficult amendments, any one of which could unravel the delicate Democratic coalition behind it. Two Democratic centrists, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, have not committed to supporting it, and a single defection would bring the measure down in the evenly divided chamber. Some significant provisions remain in play, including a measure to grant work permits and legal protection to many undocumented immigrants; funding for four weeks of paid family and medical leave; and a generous increase in the federal tax deduction for state and local taxes paid, from $10,000 a year to $80,000.

Liberals like Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who is the chairman of the Budget Committee have raised strong objections to that tax measure, which would amount to a major tax cut for wealthy homeowners who itemize their deductions. Mr. Sanders and other senators are discussing limiting who can benefit from the increased deduction based on income. Having capped the deduction in their 2017 tax law, Republicans have also singled out the provision in their attacks on the legislation, including in Mr. McCarthy’s speech. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, scoffed, “I’m almost impressed our colleagues have found a way to be this out of touch.” ADVERTISEMENT But Democrats from high-tax states like New Jersey and New York have demanded the provision as the price for their vote. Ms. Pelosi, who pronounced herself a supporter of the tax provision, defended it on Thursday, saying that it was “not about tax cuts for wealthy people” but ensuring that state and local governments have the tax revenue they need to provide education, fire and rescue services. Immigration may prove to be an even more dangerous flash point, given the politics around the issue since the rise of President Donald Trump. Democrats have had to scale back their ambitions from a pathway to citizenship to temporary protection from deportation for millions of migrants who are long term citizens of the United States, as well as a provision to recapture green cards that went unused in past years. The provision may ultimately fall out altogether because of reconciliation rules, although the parliamentarian has yet to weigh in on the latest plan. Representative Veronica Escobar, Democrat of Texas, conceded on Thursday that a pathway to citizenship was most likely lost for now, and she implored her colleagues to shut out the Republican attacks on what is left. “We have to get that over the goal line, we have to,” she said, promising, “I will take it and run with it, and not stop until we get everything we need for these precious souls.” Ms. Pelosi repeatedly said she had no fear that the bill would be brought down in the Senate or altered substantially. ADVERTISEMENT “The Senate will act its will on it, but whatever it is, it will still be transformative and historic,” she said. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader who will have to take up the mantle if the measure clears the House, promised on Thursday to finish the task. “Creating jobs, lowering costs, fighting inflation, keeping more money in people’s pockets — these are things Americans want and what Americans need and it’s what Build Back Better does,” he said on the Senate floor. “We are going to keep working on this important legislation until we get it done.” Zolan Kanno-Youngs contributed reporting."
" A quick-moving blaze in northern Colorado has led to the death of a pilot who was fighting the fire and has set off a wave of evacuations, officials said, underscoring research that wildfires are growing more intense and are occurring year-round. As of Thursday afternoon, the Kruger Rock fire near the southeastern tip of Estes Park, about 40 miles northwest of Boulder, had burned 146 acres and was 60 percent contained, Larimer County officials said on Facebook. More than 200 firefighters were battling the blaze. The fire was first reported early Tuesday morning, and crews found flames burning in steep terrain, the Larimer County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. Gusty winds and low humidity, conditions that are ripe for wildfires, caused it to quickly spread, threatening structures in the area. Several rounds of evacuation orders, both mandatory and voluntary, were issued to residents and businesses throughout the day on Tuesday. By the afternoon, the fire had burned 75 acres and caused a portion of Highway 36, a major east-west route, to close for about a day. Parts of Rocky Mountain National Park were also closed because of the fire. ADVERTISEMENT Efforts to contain the blaze carried into the evening on Tuesday, when a plane carrying a load of fire suppressant crashed, killing the pilot. No one else was on board. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash, officials said. The pilot was identified as Marc Thor Olson, an Army and Air Force veteran, by CO Fire Aviation. He had reported moments before the crash that conditions were turbulent over the fire, the Larimer County Sheriff’s Office said on Facebook. While some evacuation orders were lifted on Wednesday, there were worrying signs that the fire could spread. The National Weather Service in Boulder set a red flag warning for wildfires in the foothills, South Park and the Palmer Divide through early Friday. “A very dry air mass will be in place and relative humidity will drop as low as 6 percent,” the Weather Service said, adding that wind gusts could reach 40 miles per hour. ADVERTISEMENT There have been a few wildfires in Colorado this year, including the Oil Springs fire, which burned nearly 13,000 acres, and the Morgan Creek fire, which burned nearly 8,000 acres. Lightning started both. Last year, the Cameron Peak fire burned more than 200,000 acres in the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests in Larimer and Jackson Counties and in Rocky Mountain National Park. “One of the things that is a change of paradigm is Colorado used to talk about a fire season,” Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado said this spring, adding that the phenomenon was now year-round. Severe drought conditions, worsened by climate change, continue to affect much of the Western United States and even the Northern Plains, causing headaches for farmers and ranchers and setting the stage for large wildfires to easily spread. Wildfire experts see the signature of climate change in the dryness, high heat and longer fire season that have made these fires more extreme. “We wouldn’t be seeing this giant ramp-up in fire activity as fast as it is happening without climate change,” Park Williams, a climate scientist at U.C.L.A., said. “There’s just no way.” Alyssa Lukpat contributed reporting."
" NEW DELHI — A thick blanket of noxious haze has settled over the Indian capital of New Delhi, burning eyes and lungs, forcing schools to close and prompting ardent calls from residents for action. India’s leaders have responded with what has become an annual tradition: by pointing fingers at one another. The central government, run by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is accusing city officials of inaction, and vice versa. The country’s Supreme Court has stepped in to shut down factories and order farmers to stop burning fields. But the court’s other efforts, which last year included ordering the installation of a pair of air-scrubbing filter towers, have been derided as ineffectual. The airborne murk and the towers stand as symbols of India’s deep political dysfunction. The choking pollution has become an annual phenomenon, and the country’s scientists can accurately predict the worst days. But deep partisanship and official intransigence have hindered steps that could help clear the air. ADVERTISEMENT New Delhi’s residents don’t agree who is at fault, but they agree that more must be done. “These last three weeks I became a refugee. I was so sick that I couldn’t take it anymore,” said Jai Dhar Gupta, the owner of a business that sells air pollution mitigation tools, such as home air purifier machines and face masks. Mr. Gupta, who now lives between Delhi and Mussoorie, a city in the foothills of the Himalayas that boasts better air, became an antipollution activist and entrepreneur in 2013, after developing asthma. “It’s really sad for a nation where every time there is a health emergency the Supreme Court needs to intervene. That tells you everything about the apathy toward the health and life in our country,” said Mr. Gupta. “Nobody cares.” The court stepped in over the weekend in response to a petition filed by an 18-year-old environmental activist and after the city had endured pollution levels comparable to levels generated by major wildfires. It criticized officials for what it called their “don’t take any step” position. ADVERTISEMENT Earlier this week, Delhi’s emergency measures went into effect. Construction activity, diesel generators and trucks were banned. Schools were closed and employers were asked to keep half of their staffs at home. Six power plants outside New Delhi were ordered shut down. Under pressure from the court, city officials also deployed other steps that have inspired more jokes than optimism. They include anti-smog guns that create artificial mist, fire trucks to douse the streets with water and chemical dust suppressants. “These are hardly measures,” said Bhavreen Kandhari, a member of Warrior Moms, a group of mothers lobbying for cleaner air. “These are reactions, knee-jerk reactions. Till you have the political intent, you know nothing is going to happen.” Broadly, India’s air quality suffers from its appetite for fossil fuels, which has only grown after two decades of rapid economic growth. Last year, India was home to 15 of the 20 cities with the most hazardous air globally, and health experts have detailed how such conditions can lead to brain damage, respiratory problems and early death. Weaning the country off coal and other dirty fuels will be difficult, a reality underscored by climate negotiations that took place in Glasgow, Scotland, this month. India already struggles to meet its basic power needs. During the Scotland talks, India and China teamed up to insist upon a last-minute amendment to the language of the accord, to “phase down” coal rather than ease it out. Mr. Modi argues that India’s increasing use of coal and other fossil fuels is helping build an economy that is lifting millions out of poverty. But emissions from burning coal make the pollution problem worse for city dwellers, particularly the poor, who cannot afford air purifier machines or the electricity to run them. ADVERTISEMENT Cities also suffer from growing car emissions and the fires that the poorest residents burn to cook food and keep warm, especially when colder weather hits in November. New Delhi’s air quality takes a particular hit from the burning of crop stubble by farmers in the neighboring states of Punjab and Haryana. The bad air settles over the Indo-Gangetic plain of northern India, trapped on either side by the Thar Desert and the Himalayas, forming a toxic stew. Mr. Modi’s government says that Delhi, which is run by an opposition political party, has failed to enforce its own pollution-reduction policies, such as a limit on vehicular traffic on days when pollution surges. Earlier this week, Adesh Gupta, the Delhi president of Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, said that Delhi’s top elected official, Arvind Kejriwal, should resign. “Instead of making Delhi a world-class city as he claimed, Kejriwal has made it a smog city,” Mr. Gupta said. Delhi officials in turn say Mr. Modi’s government has failed to persuade farmers in nearby states to stop clearing their fields with fires. “Farmers in neighboring states are compelled to burn stubble as their governments are doing nothing for them,” Mr. Kejriwal said. The Supreme Court stepped in last year, too, ordering the two sides to take steps like enforcing a ban on farm fires and capturing power plant emissions. It also ordered Delhi early last year to build the two experimental smog towers, despite experts’ doubts about their impact. A study last year in the peer-reviewed journal Atmosphere called the approach unscientific. ADVERTISEMENT “Can we vacuum our air pollution problem using smog towers? The short answer is no,” the researchers said. Still, they are a tempting refuge for people desperate to escape the city’s bad air. As a coppery sun set behind smoky skies, Jasmer Singh rested under a smog tower in central Delhi as it sucked in polluted air. A monitor measuring the levels of dangerous particulate matter showed that the air it spit out was slightly cleaner, but far from what the World Health Organization considers safe. Still, Mr. Singh, a volunteer at a nearby Sikh temple, said, “around here, the air is good, lighter and better.” Some members of both Mr. Modi’s party and the opposition say they want to take a serious, nonpartisan look at the problem. “The blame game will be always there,” said Vikas Mahatme, a lawmaker with the B.J.P. Summing up the attitudes of many politicians, he said, “Why one should bother about other states? They are not voters to consider.” Still, getting all sides to work together will be difficult, he acknowledged. “We are not very active,” he said. “I tell you freely.”"
" Apple delivered an early holiday gift on Wednesday to the eco-conscious and the do-it-yourselfers: It said it would soon begin selling the parts, tools and instructions for people to do their own iPhone repairs. It was a major victory for the “right to repair” movement, which has demanded that tech manufacturers provide the necessary components and manuals for customers to fix their own smartphones, tablets and computers. Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and others have long fought proposed legislation that would make such repair resources publicly available. But the movement gained momentum this summer when the Federal Trade Commission announced that it would ramp up law enforcement against tech companies that made it difficult to fix their gadgets. For decades, the idea that people could maintain their own consumer electronics has been impractical. Genuine parts were difficult to obtain, and repairs could be expensive and intimidating. When phones and computers broke, buying new ones was the simplest option. ADVERTISEMENT Now Apple’s self-repair program is a sign that the tech industry could finally be warming to making maintenance a part of the experience of owning a gadget. “It’s a win for repair shops, it’s a win for consumers, and it’s a win for the planet,” said Nathan Proctor, a director for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy organization that worked on the “right to repair” legislation. Here’s what this means for you. Starting early next year, Apple said, people can use an online store to order parts and tools to mend its newer products, including the iPhone 12 and 13 and recent Mac computers. Customers who send in their broken part to Apple will receive credit toward the purchase of a new part. The program will focus on the most common items that need fixing, such as screens, batteries and cameras, before expanding to other types of components. The company has not yet published a list of costs for parts, but said the prices for consumers would be what authorized repair shops paid. Currently, a replacement iPhone 12 screen costs an authorized shop about $234 after a broken screen is traded in. At an Apple store, repairing an out-of-warranty iPhone 12 screen costs about $280. ADVERTISEMENT “Creating greater access to Apple genuine parts gives our customers even more choice if a repair is needed,” Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, said in a statement. In short, you will have more options to mend an iPhone, which can bring your costs down. Previously, it was easiest to visit an Apple store to get an iPhone fixed. But just as taking your car to a dealer for servicing isn’t the cheapest option, going to an Apple store also wasn’t the most cost-effective. The alternative was to take your iPhone to a third party for repair, potentially for a more competitive price. When I took a broken iPhone XS screen to an Apple store this year, I was quoted $280 for the repair, compared with $180 from an independent outlet. Yet Apple has made iPhone repairs increasingly difficult for third-party shops, said Kyle Wiens, chief executive of iFixit, a company that sells parts and publishes instructions for consumers to repair their electronics. Even when genuine parts were used, some repairs could be authenticated only with Apple’s software tools, which were not available to the public. Apple provided those software tools only to its staff and authorized repair shops that signed a contract and agreed to buy parts solely from the company. These authorized shops were then more likely to charge higher prices than unauthorized ones. Apple’s new program opens more doors. You could try fixing your device yourself to save cash. Or you could buy the parts from Apple and take them to someone else to do the repair. All of this may encourage people to maintain their products for longer and hold on to them, similar to doing regular maintenance on a car. That has implications for reducing technology waste and helping the environment. ADVERTISEMENT Apple was historically one of the most vocal opponents to the “right to repair” movement. The company cited security risks — like a customer’s data being hijacked during an unauthorized repair — as a primary reason to keep parts and instructions out of public reach. For non-Apple customers, this news is thus significant. If Apple, one of the world’s most valuable public companies, is setting a new standard with repairs, you can expect other tech manufacturers to follow — especially if they want to avoid fines from the federal government. “This announcement marks significant progress toward securing our right to repair, and we’re proud of Apple for making this bold move,” Mr. Wiens said."
" The hottest summer days in the Sierra Nevada in California greatly increase the risk that wildfires will ignite or spread, and as the planet keeps warming the risks will increase even more, scientists said Wednesday. The research, which examined daily temperatures and data from nearly 450 Sierra Nevada fires from 2001 to 2020 and projected the analysis into the future, found that the number of fires could increase by about 20 percent or more by the 2040s, and that the total burned area could increase by about 25 percent or more. The findings “show how short events like heat waves impact fires,” said Aurora A. Gutierrez, a researcher at the University of California Irvine and the lead author of a paper describing the work in the journal Science Advances. “We were able to quantify that.” ADVERTISEMENT As for the projections over the next two decades, she said, “We are getting hotter days and that’s why the risk of fires is increasing into the future.” Wildfires are increasing in size and intensity in the Western United States, and wildfire seasons are growing longer. California in particular has suffered in recent years, including last summer, when the Sierra Nevada experienced several large fires. One, the Dixie Fire, burned nearly a million acres and was the largest single fire in the state’s history. Recent research has suggested that heat and dryness associated with global warming are major reasons for the increase in bigger and stronger fires. The findings of the new study are generally in keeping with that earlier research, but there is an important difference. Most earlier studies looked at temperature and other data aggregated over monthly to annual time scales. The new research looked at daily data. “What makes this novel is that we were trying to identify the role of individual temperature extremes on individual dates,” said Jim Randerson, the senior author on the paper and a UC Irvine professor of earth systems science. ADVERTISEMENT Over the past 20 years, the researchers found, a 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degree Fahrenheit) increase in mean summer temperature increased the risk of a fire starting on a given day — either by human activity or a lightning strike — by 19 to 22 percent, and increased the burned area by 22 to 25 percent. Dr. Randerson gave an example of why extremely hot weather can lead to more, and more easily spreading, fires. “If it’s a normal day, say 80 degrees Fahrenheit, and you accidentally create a spark and there’s an ignition, you can probably stomp on it, or local fire agencies can come and put it out,” he said. The vegetation still contains a significant amount of moisture that the heat from the fire must evaporate first. That slows the spread of flames. But on a 100-degree day, Dr. Randerson said, the vegetation is so dry, with so little moisture to evaporate, that a fire spreads quickly, and grows. “You get rapid expansion,” he said, “and eventually a fire so big it can last for weeks and weeks.” John Abatzoglou, who studies the influence of climate change on wildfires at the University of California, Merced, said the work “adds to the growing scientific literature of climate-driven fire potential in forests of the West.” This year’s largest blaze fueled its own firestorms, again and again. The New York Times reconstructed a 3-D model to let you get up close. ADVERTISEMENT “The observed and projected upward march in temperatures is compounding pre-existing conditions, namely fuel accumulation in our forest, to escalate fire risk,” said Dr. Abatzoglou, who was not involved in the study.   The researchers used meteorological data, averaged over the region, and fire data from two sources: California’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, which records with precision when fires begin, and sensors on two NASA satellites that can measure fire spread on a daily basis. For Ms. Gutierrez, who worked in Dr. Randerson’s laboratory while an undergraduate at Irvine and full time there after receiving her undergraduate degree in 2018, that meant wrangling a deluge of data over many months. But researching the link between daily extreme temperatures and wildfires was worth it, she said. “We decided this is a question we need to ask,” Ms. Gutierrez said. “And yes, it’s a bit tedious with the amount of data we’re having to process, but it’s an important question.”"
" Also this week, our wrap-up from the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. By Hiroko Tabuchi How do cow hides from illegal farms in the Amazon end up in American SUVs? My colleagues in Brazil, Manuela Andreoni, a reporter, and Victor Moriyama, a photographer, went deep into the Jaci-Paraná reserve in Rondônia State to investigate a complex supply chain that links the leather used for seats in high-end trucks and cars to illegal deforestation. Traveling hours on a leaky boat and on winding dirt roads, they found and interviewed rubber tappers who are being driven from their homes, cattle ranchers profiting from the stolen land, and middlemen who help obscure the animals’ links to deforestation. They also tracked the leather to slaughterhouses and tanneries operated by some of Brazil’s largest corporations. Then, with Albert Sun, a graphics editor at The Times in New York, we crunched a wealth of data and followed the leather trade through Mexico and the United States to auto showrooms where luxury vehicles are sold. Key numbers: In the Jaci-Paraná reserve, global demand for leather is helping to sustain a growing herd of 120,000 cattle on ranches where forest once stood. ADVERTISEMENT Quotable: “If all the cattle were sold,” said Aidee Maria Moser, a retired local prosecutor who spent almost two decades fighting illegal ranching, the government would have enough money “to reforest the whole reserve.” You can read our full investigation here. What climate change looks like from space: Gavin Schmidt, the senior climate adviser at NASA, shows how the impact of global warming is etched on land and ice across the planet. Social media and climate denialism: Misinformation is rampant on social media. Fighting it requires sustained effort, writes Greg Bensinger, a member of the Times editorial board. How to buy nothing this holiday gift season: It’s not about being a Grinch or canceling Christmas, writes Annaliese Griffin, an independent journalist. ADVERTISEMENT By Somini Sengupta After all the rousing speeches and bitter negotiations, the celebrity spectacles and the parade of promises to protect this and invest in that, now what? Will the Glasgow summit make any difference in bending the arc of global warming? That depends on at least four things. First, what will leaders, starting with President Biden, do in key national capitals? Will Biden persuade Congress to pass his main climate legislation, known as the Build Back Better Act? Likewise, will the leaders of big polluter countries shift their policies at home to meet some of the big promises made, whether that’s cutting methane emissions (China) or boosting renewable energy sources (India) or reversing deforestation (Brazil) or vague net-zero goals by midcentury (Russia, India). All these pledges are voluntary. “They’re all in the ether,” Simon Stiell, the environment minister of Grenada told me the morning after the summit. Second, how much pressure will they face from their citizens, chiefly in democracies? A generation of angry young activists has been pushing politicians and corporate bosses to address the climate crisis, mainly on the streets but also in the courts, where citizens groups in a variety of countries have sued their governments and, in one instance, Shell, one of the world’s biggest oil companies. Whether and how quickly governments and private companies respond remains to be seen. Third, business. A coalition of the world’s biggest investors, which collectively controls $130 trillion in assets, promised to use its capital to hit net-zero emissions targets for investments by 2050. But will they? And how quickly? Also keep an eye on whether companies will be compelled to shift their business practices to meet a new pledge made in Glasgow to reduce deforestation. That impacts the supply chains of many industries, ranging from the palm oil used in lipstick, to soy for chicken feed. And finally, compensation. One of the most bitterly contested issues in Glasgow was a demand for funding from rich, industrialized nations mainly responsible for the warming of the atmosphere to poor, climate vulnerable countries who bear little responsibility for the problem. Rich countries, including those of the European Union and the United States, pushed back against the idea of new loss and damage compensation, as it’s known. They agreed to have a “dialogue” in the future. Demands are likely to intensify before the next global climate summit scheduled for Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, in 2022. ADVERTISEMENT For more, you can read our main summit wrap-up article here. Two Times journalists on the ground in Glasgow — one who was at her first climate conference, and another who covered her 10th — shared what it’s like on the inside of the event. By Nadja Popovich The world’s wealthiest nations are disproportionately responsible for global warming to date. At this year’s United Nations climate summit in Glasgow, a dispute erupted over whether they should begin to compensate poorer nations for the damages caused by rising temperatures. In an article published during the conference, my colleague Brad Plumer and I visualized the historical emissions output of 23 rich countries (a group identified by the United Nations as having special responsibility to help developing countries) compared with the rest of the world. Those 23 countries — including the United States, Canada, Japan and much of Western Europe — account for half of all the planet-warming greenhouse gases released from fossil fuels and industry over the past 170 years. More than 150 countries account for the other half, including major emitters like Russia and China, as well as many smaller countries that have barely contributed to climate change. ADVERTISEMENT Quotable: “We have contributed the least to this problem yet we suffer disproportionately,” said Sonam P. Wangdi, who leads a bloc of 47 nations known as the Least Developed Countries. President Biden announced plans to block new oil and gas leases around Chaco Canyon, a major Native American cultural site in New Mexico. A new report accuses the National Hockey League of using its Green program to promote refrigerants that will contribute to global warming. This is the first year that the fashion industry had a meaningful presence at global climate talks. Here’s how they grappled with the role of clothes in the climate crisis. When women lead in conservation, indicators of success often go up. Yet, they are routinely excluded. A group of local leaders in the Philippines is trying to change that. There’s a troubling trend of premature births across the United States, a problem that some research has associated with climate change. A few homeowners across the United States are experimenting with new and old construction techniques to build more disaster-resistant houses. By Somini Sengupta “A hungry man is an angry man,” one activist at the climate summit in Glasgow observed. He meant: Anger is not good for negotiation. The organizers of the international climate summit in Paris in 2015 like to say their fresh baguettes, buttery croissants and poulet à la persillade, washed down with French wine, helped to yield a landmark global accord. The culinary contrast was hard to miss in Glasgow. On offer this year: Scotch beef ramen, venison sausage rolls, and “neeps and tatties.” (That’s turnips and potatoes, the menu explained.) ADVERTISEMENT Comfort food, perhaps. But not the same as a warm pain au chocolat. Can the menu really make a difference to the outcome of a global summit? Maybe. A 2016 research paper on gastrodiplomacy found that eating a meal together improved social interactions between those who dine together, not to mention fewer hierarchical displays of dominance and submissiveness. “In other words, agreeable behaviors were found to increase during meals, as compared to at other times,” it said.

" Este reportaje fue producido en colaboración con la Red de Investigaciones de la Selva Tropical del Centro Pulitzer. BURITIS, Brasil — Una mañana de verano, Odilon Caetano Felipe, un ganadero que cría reses en tierras deforestadas de manera ilegal en la Amazonia, se reunió con un comerciante y firmó la entrega de 72 animales recién engordados. Con ese trazo del bolígrafo, Felipe le dio a su ganado un historial limpio: al venderlo, ocultó su papel en la destrucción de la mayor selva tropical del mundo. Durante el almuerzo, poco después de la venta del 14 de julio, Felipe habló abiertamente del negocio que lo ha hecho rico. Reconoció haber talado la espesa selva amazónica y que no había pagado por la tierra. También dijo que estructuró sus ventas para ocultar el verdadero origen de su ganado al vender a un intermediario y así crear un rastro de papel que muestra falsamente que sus animales provienen de un rancho legal. La mayoría de los ganaderos de la zona hacen lo mismo, dijo. “No importa”, dijo, si su granja es legal o no. Una investigación de The New York Times sobre la industria brasileña de los mataderos, en rápida expansión —un negocio que no solo vende carne de res al mundo, sino también toneladas de cuero al año a grandes empresas de Estados Unidos y otros países—, ha detectado lagunas en sus sistemas de vigilancia que permiten que el ganado procedente de tierras amazónicas deforestadas ilegalmente pase sin ser detectado por las curtiembres de Brasil y llegue a compradores de todo el mundo. ADVERTISEMENT El rancho de Felipe es una de las más de 600 propiedades que operan en una zona de la Amazonia conocida como Jaci-Paraná, una reserva medioambiental especialmente protegida donde la deforestación está restringida. Y transacciones como la suya son el eje de un complejo comercio mundial que vincula la deforestación de la Amazonia con un creciente apetito en Estados Unidos por los lujosos asientos de cuero de las camionetas, los todoterrenos y otros vehículos vendidos por algunos de los mayores fabricantes de automóviles del mundo, entre ellos General Motors, Ford y Volkswagen. Un vehículo de lujo puede necesitar una docena o más de pieles, y los proveedores estadounidenses compran cada vez más el cuero de Brasil. Aunque la región amazónica es uno de los principales proveedores de carne de res del mundo, cada vez más a las naciones asiáticas, el apetito global por el cuero asequible también significa que las pieles de estos millones de reses representan un lucrativo mercado internacional valorado en cientos de miles de millones de dólares anuales. Este comercio del cuero muestra cómo los hábitos de compra de los países más ricos del mundo pueden tener consecuencias nefastas en los países en desarrollo, en este caso al hacer rentable la destrucción de la Amazonia a pesar del consenso científico de que su protección ayudaría a frenar el cambio climático. ADVERTISEMENT Para rastrear el comercio mundial del cuero, desde los ranchos ilegales de la selva brasileña hasta los asientos de los vehículos estadounidenses, el Times entrevistó a ganaderos, comerciantes, fiscales y reguladores en Brasil, y visitó curtiembres, ranchos y otras instalaciones. El Times habló con participantes de todos los niveles del comercio ilícito en la Reserva Extractiva Jaci Paraná, una zona del estado de Rondônia a la que se ha concedido una protección especial porque está habitada por comunidades de personas que, durante generaciones, han vivido de la tierra explotando árboles de caucho. Estas comunidades están siendo expulsadas por los ganaderos que quieren la tierra para las reses. En la última década, los ganaderos han ampliado considerablemente su presencia en la reserva, y en la actualidad se ha desbrozado un 56 por ciento de la misma, según los datos recopilados por la agencia estatal de medio ambiente. El informe también se basa en el análisis de datos empresariales y de comercio internacional en varios países y en miles de certificados de transporte de ganado emitidos por el gobierno brasileño. Los certificados fueron obtenidos por la Agencia de Investigación Medioambiental, un grupo de defensa en Washington. El Times verificó de manera independiente los certificados y obtuvo por separado miles más. Esto permitió seguir el rastro del cuero desde las granjas ilegales de la Amazonia hasta los mataderos operados por los tres mayores empacadores de carne de Brasil, JBS, Marfrig y Minerva, y luego a las curtiembres a las que abastecen. JBS se describe como el mayor proveedor de cuero del mundo. Según Aidee Maria Moser, fiscal jubilada del estado de Rondônia que pasó casi dos décadas luchando contra la ganadería ilegal en la reserva de Jaci-Paraná, la práctica de vender animales criados en la reserva a comerciantes intermediarios sugiere una intención de ocultar su origen. “Es una forma de dar un barniz de legalidad al ganado”, dijo, “para que los mataderos puedan negar cualquier cosa ilegal”. El problema no se limita a Rondônia. Este mes, una auditoría dirigida por los fiscales del vecino estado de Pará, que alberga el segundo mayor rebaño de ganado de la Amazonia, descubrió que JBS había adquirido 301.000 animales, que suponen el 32 por ciento de sus compras en el estado, entre enero de 2018 y junio de 2019 a granjas que violaban los compromisos para evitar la deforestación ilegal. ADVERTISEMENT JBS no estuvo de acuerdo con los criterios empleados por los fiscales y aceptó mejorar su sistema de monitoreo, bloquear a los proveedores señalados por la investigación y donar 900.000 dólares al estado en respuesta a los hallazgos de la auditoría. Para tener una idea de la escala de los ranchos que operan ilegalmente en la Amazonia brasileña, el Times superpuso los mapas gubernamentales de las tierras amazónicas protegidas, las áreas deforestadas y los límites de las granjas con las ubicaciones de los ranchos que JBS identificó públicamente como proveedores de sus mataderos en 2020. El análisis demostró que, entre los proveedores de JBS, los ranchos que cubrían una superficie estimada de 4000 kilómetros cuadrados se superponían significativamente con tierras indígenas, una zona de conservación o un área que fue deforestada después de 2008, cuando se pusieron en marcha las leyes que regulan la deforestación en Brasil. La metodología y los resultados fueron analizados y verificados por un equipo de investigadores y académicos independientes que estudian el uso de la tierra en la Amazonia brasileña. Los datos de comercio internacional mostraron que las empresas propietarias de las curtiembres que se abastecían de las pieles luego enviaron el cuero a las fábricas de México dirigidas por Lear, un importante fabricante de asientos que suministra a las plantas de montaje de automóviles de todo Estados Unidos. Lear dijo en 2018 que alrededor del 70 por ciento de sus pieles en bruto provenían de Brasil. Los cueros también van a otros países, como Italia, Vietnam y China, para su uso en las industrias automotriz, de moda y de muebles, según mostraron los datos comerciales. JBS reconoció que casi tres cuartas partes de los ranchos identificados en el análisis del Times coincidían con tierras que el gobierno clasifica como deforestadas ilegalmente, o como territorios indígenas o zonas de conservación. Pero dijo que todas las fincas cumplían con las normas para evitar la deforestación cuando JBS les compró. JBS dijo que, en los casos en que había superposiciones, las fincas estaban autorizadas a operar en zonas protegidas o deforestadas, o sus límites habían cambiado, o habían seguido las normas para solucionar sus infracciones medioambientales. La ganadería está permitida en algunas zonas protegidas de Brasil, si cumple con las prácticas sostenibles. En un comunicado, JBS dijo que durante más de una década ha mantenido un sistema de control que verifica el cumplimiento de su política medioambiental por parte de los proveedores. “Más de 14.000 proveedores han sido bloqueados por el incumplimiento de esta política”, dijo. Sin embargo, la empresa indicó que “el gran reto para JBS, y para la cadena de suministro de ganado vacuno en general, es controlar a los proveedores de sus proveedores, puesto que la empresa no tiene información sobre ellos”. ADVERTISEMENT La deforestación de la Amazonia se ha disparado en los últimos años debido a la carrera de los ganaderos por abastecer la creciente demanda de carne de res, especialmente en China. Los responsables de la industria del cuero señalan que, mientras haya demanda de carne de res, no hacen más que usar pieles que, de otro modo, irían a parar a los rellenos sanitarios. Raoni Rajão, quien estudia las cadenas de suministro de la Amazonia en la Universidad Federal de Minas Gerais, dijo que debido a que la industria del cuero hace que la ganadería sea más rentable, comparte la responsabilidad de cualquier deforestación. “El cuero puede tener un alto valor agregado”, dijo. La pérdida de bosques está destruyendo la capacidad dela Amazonia para absorber el dióxido de carbono que los árboles extraen del aire. El dióxido de carbono que procede de la quema de combustibles fósiles es el principal impulsor del cambio climático. Brasil fue uno de los más de 100 países que se comprometieron a poner fin a la deforestación para 2030 en la reciente cumbre del clima de las Naciones Unidas celebrada en Glasgow. Aunque la mayoría de los ranchos de la región amazónica no están vinculados a la deforestación ilegal, los resultados muestran cómo el cuero ilegal está entrando en la cadena de suministro mundial, eludiendo un sistema que los mataderos y las propias empresas de cuero crearon en los últimos años para tratar de demostrar que su ganado solo proviene de ranchos legítimos. ADVERTISEMENT En respuesta a preguntas detalladas, JBS, Marfrig y Minerva dijeron que no tenían conocimiento de que el ganado de la reserva Jaci-Paraná estuviera entrando en sus cadenas de suministro. Las tres dijeron que tenían sistemas para controlar las fincas que abastecen directamente a sus mataderos y que excluyen a las granjas que no cumplen las leyes medioambientales. Y las tres reconocieron que no pueden rastrear a los proveedores indirectos, como Felipe, que venden el ganado a través de intermediarios, ocultando su origen. Lear dijo que utilizó “un sólido proceso de abastecimiento” que garantizó que trabajaba “con los proveedores más capaces y avanzados que se comprometen a comprar pieles de ganado criado en granjas que cumplen la normativa”. La empresa dijo que si los proveedores violaban sus políticas, tomaría medidas que podrían incluir la cancelación de sus contratos “y/o acciones legales contra el proveedor”. GM dijo que esperaba que sus proveedores “cumplieran las leyes y reglamentos y actuasen de forma coherente con los principios y valores” del fabricante de automóviles. Ford dijo que aspiraba a “abastecerse solo de materias primas producidas de forma responsable”. Volkswagen dijo que sus proveedores ya se adherían a un alto nivel de sostenibilidad. En Jaci-Paraná, la demanda mundial de cuero está ayudando a mantener un rebaño creciente de 120.000 cabezas de ganado donde antes había bosques. “Si se vendiera todo el ganado”, dijo Moser, la exfiscala, el gobierno tendría suficiente dinero “para reforestar toda la reserva”. ADVERTISEMENT El pasado diciembre llovía a cántaros cuando dos hombres atracaron en la casa de Lourenço Durães, junto al río Jaci-Paraná. Durães, un recolector de caucho de 71 años, invitó a los hombres a entrar y les ofreció un café. Después de hablar del clima durante unos minutos, uno de los visitantes fue al grano. “No voy a engañarte”, dijo, según Durães y uno de sus amigos, que recientemente describieron el encuentro. “Vine a matarte”. Querían deshacerse de Durães porque sus tierras son valiosas para los ganaderos. Jaci-Paraná fue creada en 1996 para conceder a una comunidad de recolectores de caucho el derecho a seguir con su medio de vida. Durães es uno de los últimos recolectores. La comunidad está siendo expulsada por la deforestación. “Estamos asustados, pero espero que se haga justicia”, dijo Durães, y añadió que creía que ese día se había librado de la amenaza porque es un hombre mayor. Según Durães y una denuncia ante la policía presentada por su amigo, el presunto asesino identificó a la persona que lo había enviado, pero solo por un apodo. La policía no investigó, según el informe policial, porque Durães y su amigo no pudieron proporcionar el nombre completo de la persona para presentar cargos. En una entrevista, Lucilene Pedrosa, que dirige la división regional de la policía, dijo que su equipo estaba esperando que los hombres proporcionen más información para poder investigar. Los datos del gobierno analizados por el Times muestran el atractivo que despierta la tierra de esa zona. Según esos datos, entre enero de 2018 y junio de 2021 los ranchos que operan en Jaci-Paraná en tierras deforestadas ilegalmente vendieron al menos 17.700 reses a ranchos intermedios. Los compradores eran proveedores de los tres grandes frigoríficos, JBS, Marfrig y Minerva, según los datos del gobierno y de las empresas. ADVERTISEMENT Casi la mitad de esas 17.700 reses fueron compradas por Armando Castanheira Filho, un comerciante local que ha sido uno de los mayores compradores de Jaci-Paraná y que es un proveedor directo de los tres grandes frigoríficos. Esas ventas crearon un rastro de papel que ocultaba que el ganado procedía de ranchos ilegales. Una reportera del Times fue testigo de una transacción de este tipo cuando Felipe —el ganadero que reconoció haber participado en la deforestación ilegal— vendió sus 72 reses este año. El comprador de ese día era Castanheira. El Times siguió el rastro de los animales. Once horas después, acabaron en un matadero de Marfrig. Marfrig tiene un sitio web en el que indica la procedencia de su ganado, en un esfuerzo por demostrar que se abastece de manera responsable. En el caso del envío del 14 de julio rastreado por el Times, el rancho de Felipe no aparece en la página web. Pero en la lista de fincas que suministraron ganado para el sacrificio del día siguiente sí figura la granja de Castanheira, que está situada afuera de la reserva. Al final de ese día en el matadero de Marfrig, un camión marcado con el nombre de una curtiembre, Bluamerica, salió del matadero llevando pieles. Bluamerica es una curtiembre que suministra a Lear, el fabricante de asientos para automóviles. ADVERTISEMENT Castanheira confirmó que algunas de las reses que compra a la reserva van directamente al matadero, sin pasar por su rancho, aunque los papeles muestran que pasaron primero por su propia finca. Negó que lo hiciera para ocultar el origen del ganado. “No lo hago para ‘blanquear’ nada”, escribió en un mensaje de texto. Dijo que su intención era simplemente beneficiarse de la diferencia entre lo que paga por cada animal y lo que puede obtener en el matadero. Marfrig, Minerva y JBS dijeron que no enviaban camiones para recoger el ganado en la reserva de Jaci-Paraná, ni en ningún otro lugar que no fueran sus proveedores directos. Los abogados de Marfrig también han presentado un informe a la policía que enumera los hechos descritos por el Times, calificándolos como “posibles delitos de carácter penal”. Castanheira sostiene que la reportera del Times fue testigo del único caso de este tipo de transacciones por su parte. Las tres empresas cárnicas dijeron que ahora han excluido a Castanheira de su grupo de proveedores. ADVERTISEMENT Dos de los propietarios de Bluamerica, las empresas Viposa y Vancouros, afirmaron que sus proveedores eran objeto de auditorías periódicas y reconocieron las dificultades que plantea el seguimiento de los proveedores indirectos. Ambas empresas dijeron que estaban trabajando con el Fondo Mundial para la Naturaleza, un grupo medioambiental con sede en Suiza, para mejorar sus sistemas. En general, un análisis de los datos del gobierno sobre los movimientos de ganado en Jaci-Paraná entre 2018 y 2021 identificó 124 transacciones que muestran signos de “lavado de ganado”, dicen los expertos. Las transacciones muestran que al menos 5600 reses fueron transferidas de granjas en la reserva a intermediarios que, en el mismo día, vendieron ganado a los tres principales mataderos. Holly Gibbs, geógrafa de la Universidad de Wisconsin-Madison que lleva una década investigando el agronegocio en la Amazonía, dijo que, aunque los intermediarios legítimos suelen comprar y vender ganado el mismo día, el hecho de que las transacciones no se sigan de cerca es “una enorme laguna”. “Están introduciendo animales criados en una zona protegida en las cadenas de suministro nacionales e internacionales”, dijo. La cadena de suministros, desde los ranchos hasta los concesionarios, es compleja. Las pieles de los mataderos de Minerva y JBS van a las curtiembres propiedad de JBS, mientras que las de Marfrig son procesadas principalmente por Vancouros y Viposa, según los datos corporativos y las entrevistas. Los datos comerciales recopilados por Panjiva, la unidad de investigación de la cadena de suministro de S&P Global Market Intelligence, muestran que el fabricante de asientos Lear, con sede en Southfield, Míchigan, es el mayor comprador estadounidense de pieles de JBS, Vancouros y Viposa. El pasado mes de mayo, los ganaderos ilegales de Jaci-Paraná lograron una importante victoria. El gobernador de Rondônia firmó una ley que reduce el tamaño de la reserva en un 90 por ciento. La ley, contra la que los fiscales están luchando en los tribunales, abre una vía para que los ganaderos de las tierras deforestadas ilegalmente puedan legalizar sus negocios. Los críticos de esa medida dicen que podría sentar un precedente para una mayor deforestación en otras reservas protegidas. ADVERTISEMENT Sea cual sea el resultado de esa lucha legal, Durães, el recolector de caucho, dijo que no tenía intención de abandonar su trozo de bosque. El pasto para el ganado ya llega a un kilómetro y medio de su casa de madera de dos habitaciones. Vivir entre los poderosos árboles es la única existencia que conoce. Y quedarse, dijo, es “la única manera de mantener el bosque en pie”. Cada pocos segundos, en la curtiembre Vancouros, al sur de Brasil, el sonido de las pieles cayendo en docenas de tambores de madera de tres metros se ve interrumpido por los chasquidos de un marcador neumático cuando cada piel es perforada con un código de siete dígitos que traza su origen. Clébio Marques, director comercial de la curtiembre, sacó una piel azul húmeda de una pila, sacó su teléfono y tecleó su código en el sitio web que su empresa creó para sus clientes, como Lear. Luego aparecieron los datos del proveedor de esa piel en concreto. “Todo nuestro cuero es rastreable”, dijo. “Esto no es obligatorio, nadie lo pidió, pero pensamos que el mercado necesitaba más transparencia”. Pero entonces a Marques se le presentó la constatación de que uno de sus proveedores más importantes, Marfrig, compraba ganado a proveedores cuyas transacciones mostraban indicios de blanqueo de ganado. “Estoy sorprendido”, dijo. “Esperamos que el producto principal sea legal”. ADVERTISEMENT Sin embargo, subrayó que la vigilancia de su propia empresa no era culpable. “Tenemos que confiar en los documentos que nos proporcionan, porque nuestra auditoría se basa en su sistema”, dijo Marques. Los tres principales empacadores de carne tienen sistemas diseñados para rastrear la última granja de la que procede el ganado que sacrifican. Sin embargo, los tres tienen el mismo defecto: no tienen en cuenta el hecho de que el ganado no suele pasar toda su vida en una sola granja. Por lo tanto, no consideran que un proveedor directo pueda estar vendiendo ganado que en realidad fue criado por otra persona, en tierras deforestadas ilegalmente. Los sistemas de seguimiento se crearon tras una investigación de Greenpeace en 2009 que vinculaba a los proveedores brasileños de carne y cuero con la deforestación ilegal. En la actualidad, las tres grandes empresas declaran que tienen políticas de tolerancia cero con la deforestación para todos sus proveedores directos. Los tres principales mataderos publican sus datos de seguimiento en internet. El de JBS es el más detallado; las otras empresas omiten la ubicación exacta de los ranchos. Fue el análisis del Times de estos datos de JBS para 2020, el año más reciente disponible, el que indicó que los proveedores de la empresa incluían ranchos que podrían haber violado las normas gubernamentales diseñadas para evitar la deforestación y el desplazamiento de los pueblos indígenas. ADVERTISEMENT JBS afirmó que todos sus proveedores cumplían las normas en el momento de la compra. Marfrig y Minerva dijeron que compartían toda la información sobre sus proveedores directos que permite la ley de privacidad de datos de Brasil. Como parte de este proceso, las curtidurías se apoyan en una organización financiada por la industria, el Leather Working Group, para certificar su cumplimiento. El grupo ha asignado su máxima calificación, “oro”, a todas las curtiembres de la Amazonia que suministran cuero a Lear, lo que significa que se adhieren a prácticas ambientalmente sostenibles. En un comunicado, el grupo dijo que estaba trabajando para mejorar sus protocolos de trazabilidad, pero que “debido a la complejidad de los sistemas de cría en Brasil y la falta de bases de datos disponibles públicamente, todavía no hay, por desgracia, una solución fácil para esta situación”. JBS, Marfrig y Minerva se han comprometido públicamente a mejorar el seguimiento de los ranchos que venden ganado a sus proveedores directos. JBS ha dicho que rastreará una capa de proveedores indirectos para 2025. Marfrig se comprometió a rastrear a todos sus proveedores indirectos en la Amazonia para 2025 y Minerva dijo que tendría cadenas de suministro totalmente rastreables en Sudamérica para 2030. “Solo un seguimiento desde el nacimiento hasta el sacrificio de los animales individuales puede garantizar que no hay deforestación en estas cadenas de suministro de alto riesgo en la Amazonía”, dijo Rick Jacobsen, de la Agencia de Investigación Ambiental, el grupo sin fines de lucro. Los asientos de cuero del todoterreno Escalade de Cadillac, descrito por un concesionario del estado de Washington como “un hotel de lujo sobre ruedas”, pueden elevar el precio del modelo de primera línea de General Motors a más de 100.000 dólares. ADVERTISEMENT El Escalade es uno de los muchos vehículos que se venden en Estados Unidos y que usan asientos de cuero y otros accesorios de Lear, una empresa que domina una quinta parte del mercado mundial de asientos para automóviles. Ni Lear ni GM etiquetan la procedencia del cuero para los asientos de sus carros. Las importaciones de cuero brasileño de Lear han aumentado durante la última década, impulsadas por un aumento del cuero procedente de JBS, según Panjiva, la empresa de datos sobre la cadena de suministro. El año pasado, Lear fue el mayor importador estadounidense de cuero y pieles de Brasil, importando unas 6000 toneladas, gran parte de ellas de JBS, según los datos de Panjiva. Los camiones de gran tamaño y los grandes todoterrenos son una fuerza creciente detrás de la demanda de acesorios de cuero en la industria del automóvil. Para muchos compradores, el cuero “grita lujo y suele añadir un importante valor de reventa”, dijo Drew Winter, analista principal de Wards Intelligence, una empresa de investigación de automóviles. Raymond E. Scott, director general de Lear, expuso la importancia de los vehículos de lujo en una presentación a los inversores en junio. La empresa tiene el 45 por ciento del mercado de lujo, dijo. Y lo que estaba impulsando el crecimiento del negocio de asientos de Lear era “realmente la fuerza de los todoterreno y los camiones de tamaño completo de GM”, un elenco que también incluye la Yukon, la Chevrolet Tahoe y la Suburban. En Brasil, “el 100 por ciento de nuestros proveedores utilizan el geo-cercado” (una tecnología que utiliza el GPS para establecer una valla virtual) “para asegurarse de que no compran animales de granjas involucradas con la deforestación”, dijo Lear en un comunicado de 2018. Sin embargo, los hallazgos del Times en Brasil indican que los proveedores de Lear no tenían la capacidad de rastrear todo el ganado de esta manera. Lear dijo que exigía a todos los proveedores que cumplieran con una política de no deforestación, que prohíbe el uso de cualquier material proveniente de áreas deforestadas ilegalmente o de tierras indígenas u otras protegidas. Según los archivos corporativos, los otros clientes más importantes de Lear son Ford, Daimler, Volkswagen y Stellantis, formada por la fusión de Fiat Chrysler y el fabricante francés de autos Peugeot y Citroën. ADVERTISEMENT General Motors dijo que su cadena de suministros estaba “construida sobre relaciones sólidas, transparentes y de confianza”. Ford dijo que se exigía a sí misma y a sus proveedores unos estándares ambiciosos y que “lo hizo bien en muchas áreas y puede mejorar en otras”. Volkswagen dijo que trabajaba en un mejor seguimiento de la cadena de suministro hasta la granja. Daimler dijo que un pequeño porcentaje de su cuero procedía de Brasil. Stellantis afirmó que compartía la preocupación por la rastreabilidad, y que trabajaba activamente para confirmar la ubicación de las curtiembres y las granjas en su cadena de suministro. El año pasado, alrededor de un tercio de las 15.000 toneladas de cuero importadas a Estados Unidos procedían de Brasil, que recientemente superó a Italia para convertirse en el mayor exportador de cuero y pieles a Estados Unidos. Gran parte de ese aumento puede atribuirse a la industria del automóvil. La mayor parte de los envíos de cuero de JBS a Lear en Estados Unidos viaja desde São Paulo a Houston, según datos comerciales de Panjiva. Desde allí, gran parte se transporta por camión a través de la frontera mexicana hasta una de las dos docenas de fábricas de asientos de automóviles que Lear tiene en México, donde los trabajadores cortan y cosen las pieles para hacer cubreasientos. ADVERTISEMENT Luego, el cuero vuelve a transportarse por la frontera. Desde enero de 2019 hasta junio de 2021, las plantas de Lear en México enviaron unas 1800 toneladas de cuero a Estados Unidos, según los datos de transporte por camión contabilizados por Material Research. Su destino final: las instalaciones de Lear en todo el país. Suelen estar situadas más cerca de las plantas de ensamblaje final de automóviles, lo que facilita que la empresa pueda adaptar el color y otras variaciones a los modelos que salen de la línea de montaje de vehículos. Uno de estos destinos es la planta de General Motors en Arlington, Texas, un extenso campus de más de 100 hectáreas en el que el fabricante de automóviles produce algunos de los vehículos más grandes y lujosos de la empresa, como el Escalade. Los trabajadores automotrices ensamblan unos 1300 todoterrenos al día para vender en Estados Unidos y para exportar. A diez minutos en carro, Lear tiene una fábrica que confecciona asientos de cuero.

" This article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center’s Rainforest Investigations Network. BURITIS, Brazil — One morning this summer, Odilon Caetano Felipe, a rancher who raises cattle on illegally deforested land in the Amazon, met with a trader and signed over 72 newly fattened animals. With that stroke of the pen, Mr. Felipe gave his cattle a clean record: By selling them, he obscured their role in the destruction of the world’s largest rainforest. Over lunch shortly after the July 14 sale, Mr. Felipe spoke openly about the business that has made him wealthy. He acknowledged cutting down the thick Amazon forest and that he had not paid for the land. He also said he structured his sales to hide the true origins of his cattle by selling to a middleman, creating a paper trail falsely showing his animals as coming from a legal ranch. Other ranchers in the area do the same, he said. “It makes no difference,” he said, whether his farm is legal or not. A New York Times investigation into Brazil’s rapidly expanding slaughterhouse industry — a business that sells not only beef to the world, but tons of leather annually to major companies in the United States and elsewhere — has identified loopholes in its monitoring systems that allow hides from cattle kept on illegally deforested Amazon land to flow undetected through Brazil’s tanneries and on to buyers worldwide. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Felipe’s ranch is one of more than 600 that operate in an area of the Amazon known as Jaci-Paraná, a specially protected environmental reserve where deforestation is restricted. And transactions like his are the linchpins of a complex global trade that links Amazon deforestation to a growing appetite in the United States for luxurious leather seats in pickup trucks, SUVs and other vehicles sold by some of the world’s largest automakers, among them General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen. A luxury vehicle can require a dozen or more hides, and suppliers in the United States increasingly buy their leather from Brazil. While the Amazon region is one of the world’s major providers of beef, increasingly to Asian nations, the global appetite for affordable leather also means that the hides of these millions of cattle supply a lucrative international leather market valued in the hundreds of billions of dollars annually. This leather trade shows how the wealthy world’s shopping habits are tied to environmental degradation in developing nations, in this case by helping to fund destruction of the Amazon despite its valuable biodiversity and the scientific consensus that protecting it would help to slow climate change. ADVERTISEMENT To track the global trade in leather from illegal ranches in the Brazilian rainforest to the seats in American vehicles, The Times interviewed ranchers, traders, prosecutors and regulators in Brazil, and visited tanneries, ranches and other facilities. The Times spoke to participants at all levels of the illicit trade in the Jaci-Paraná Extractive Reserve, an area in Rondônia State that has been granted special protections because it is home to communities of people who, for generations, have lived off the land by tapping rubber trees. These communities are now being forced out by ranchers who want the land for cattle. Over the past decade, ranchers have significantly expanded their presence in the reserve, and today some 56 percent of it has been cleared, according to data compiled by the state environmental agency. The reporting is also based on analysis of corporate and international trade data in several countries and thousands of cattle-transport certificates issued by the Brazilian government. The certificates were obtained by the Environmental Investigation Agency, an advocacy group in Washington. The Times independently verified the certificates and separately obtained thousands of additional ones. This enabled the tracking of leather from illegal farms in the Amazon to slaughterhouses operated by Brazil’s three biggest meatpackers, JBS, Marfrig and Minerva, and then to the tanneries they supply. JBS describes itself as the world’s largest leather processor. According to Aidee Maria Moser, a retired prosecutor in Rondônia State who spent almost two decades fighting illegal ranching in the Jaci-Paraná reserve, the practice of selling animals reared in the reserve to middleman traders suggests an intent to conceal their origin. “It’s a way to give a veneer of legality to the cattle,” she said, “so slaughterhouses can deny there was anything illegal.” The problem isn’t limited to Rondônia. Last month, an audit led by prosecutors in the neighboring state of Pará, home to the second-largest cattle herd in the Amazon, found that JBS had bought 301,000 animals, amounting to 32 percent of its purchases in the state, between January 2018 and June 2019 from farms that violated commitments to prevent illegal deforestation. ADVERTISEMENT JBS disagreed with the criteria used by the prosecutors and agreed to improve its monitoring system, block suppliers flagged by the research and donate $900,000 to the state in response to the audit. To get a sense of scale of the ranches operating in vulnerable areas across the Brazilian Amazon, The Times overlaid government maps of protected Amazon land, deforested areas and farm boundaries with the locations of ranches that JBS publicly listed as supplying its slaughterhouses in 2020. An analysis showed that, among the JBS suppliers, ranches covering an estimated 2,500 square miles significantly overlapped Indigenous land, a conservation zone or an area that was deforested after 2008, when laws regulating deforestation were put in place in Brazil. The methodology and results were examined and verified by a team of independent researchers and academics who study land use in the Brazilian Amazon. International trade data showed companies that own tanneries supplied with the hides had then shipped leather to factories in Mexico run by Lear, a major seat maker that supplies auto assembly plants across the United States. Lear said in 2018 that it was then sourcing about 70 percent of its raw hides from Brazil. Brazil’s hides also go to other countries including Italy, Vietnam and China for use in the automotive, fashion and furniture industries, the trade data showed. JBS acknowledged that almost three-quarters of the ranches identified in The Times’s analysis did overlap with land that the government categorizes as illegally deforested, or as Indigenous land or a conservation zone. But it said all the ranches had been in compliance with rules to prevent deforestation when JBS bought from them. JBS said that, in those instances where there were overlaps, the farms were allowed to operate in protected or deforested areas, or their boundaries had changed, or they had followed rules to fix their environmental violations. Ranching is allowed in some protected areas in Brazil if it follows sustainable practices. In a statement, JBS said it has maintained a monitoring system for more than a decade that verifies supplier compliance with its environmental policy. “More than 14,000 suppliers have been blocked for failure to comply with this policy,” it said. However, the company said, “the great challenge for JBS, and for the beef cattle supply chain in general, is to monitor the suppliers of its suppliers, since the company has no information about them.” ADVERTISEMENT Amazon deforestation has surged in recent years as ranchers race to supply growing demand for beef, particularly in China. Leather industry representatives make the point that as long as there is demand for beef, they are simply using hides that would otherwise be sent to landfills. Raoni Rajão, who studies Amazon supply chains at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, said that because the leather industry makes ranching more profitable, it shares responsibility for any deforestation. “Leather can have high added value,” he said. Forest loss is destroying the Amazon’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide, which trees pull out of the air. Carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels is the main driver of climate change. Brazil was one of more than 100 nations to pledge to end deforestation by 2030 at the recent United Nations climate summit in Glasgow. While most ranches in the Amazon region aren’t linked to illegal deforestation, the findings show how illegal leather is entering the global supply chain, circumventing a system that slaughterhouses and leather companies themselves created in recent years to try to show that their cattle come only from legitimate ranches. ADVERTISEMENT In response to detailed questions, JBS, Marfrig and Minerva said they weren’t aware that cattle from the Jaci-Paraná reserve were entering their supply chains. All three said they had systems to monitor farms that supply their slaughterhouses directly, and that they exclude farms that don’t comply with environmental laws. But all three acknowledged that they can’t trace indirect suppliers, such as Mr. Felipe, who sell cattle through middlemen, masking their origins. Lear said it used “a robust sourcing process” that ensured it worked “with the most capable and advanced suppliers that are committed to purchasing hides from cattle reared on compliant farms.” The company said that if suppliers violated its policies, it would take steps that could include canceling their contracts “and/or legal action against the supplier.” G.M. said it expected suppliers to “comply with laws, regulations, and act in a way consistent with the principles and values” of the automaker. Ford said it aspired “to source only raw materials that are responsibly produced.” Volkswagen said its suppliers already adhered to a high level of sustainability. In Jaci-Paraná, the global demand for leather is helping to sustain a growing herd of 120,000 cattle where forest once stood. “If all the cattle were sold,” said Ms. Moser, the former prosecutor, the government would have enough money “to reforest the whole reserve.” It was pouring rain last December when two men docked at Lourenço Durães’ home by the Jaci-Paraná River. Mr. Durães, a 71-year-old rubber tapper, invited the men in and offered them coffee. Then, after discussing the weather for a few minutes, one of the visitors got right to the point. ADVERTISEMENT “I won’t fool you,” he said, according to Mr. Durães and one of his friends, who together described the meeting recently. “I came here to kill you.” They wanted to get rid of Mr. Durães because his land is valuable to ranchers. Jaci-Paraná was created in 1996 to grant a community of rubber-tree tappers the right to pursue their livelihood. Mr. Durães is among the last of the tappers. The community is being pushed out by deforestation. “We are frightened, but I hope for justice,” Mr. Durães said, adding that he believed he was spared that day because he is an old man. According to Mr. Durães and a police report filed by his friend, the would-be hit man identified the person who had sent him, but only by a nickname. The police didn’t investigate, according to the police report, because Mr. Durães and his friend couldn’t provide a full name of a person to press charges against. In an interview, Lucilene Pedrosa, who directs the regional police division, said her team was waiting for the men to provide more information so it could investigate. Government data analyzed by The Times shows the appetite for land in the area. According to the numbers, between January 2018 and June 2021 ranches operating in Jaci-Paraná on illegally deforested land sold at least 17,700 cattle to intermediate ranches. The buyers were suppliers to the three big meatpackers, JBS, Marfrig and Minerva, according to both government and corporate data. ADVERTISEMENT Almost half of those 17,700 cattle were bought by Armando Castanheira Filho, a local trader who has been one of the largest buyers in Jaci-Paraná and a direct supplier to all three major meatpackers. The sales to him created a paper trail that concealed that the cattle originated on illegal ranches. A Times reporter witnessed such a transaction when Mr. Felipe, the rancher who acknowledged engaging in deforestation, sold his 72 cattle this year. The buyer that day was Mr. Castanheira. The Times then tracked the animals. Eleven hours later, they ended up at a Marfrig slaughterhouse. Marfrig runs a website listing where its cattle come from in an effort to show that it sources cattle responsibly. For the July 14 shipment tracked by The Times, Mr. Felipe’s ranch isn’t listed on the site. But the list of farms that supplied cattle for the next day’s slaughter does include Mr. Castanheira’s farm, which is located outside the reserve. At the end of that day at the Marfrig slaughterhouse, a truck marked with the name of a tannery, Bluamerica, left the slaughterhouse carrying hides. Bluamerica is a tannery that supplies Lear, the automobile seat maker. Mr. Castanheira confirmed that some of the cattle he buys from the reserve go directly to slaughter, spending no time at his ranch, although the paperwork shows they went through his own farm first. He denied doing it to hide the cattle’s origin. ADVERTISEMENT “I don’t do this to ‘launder’ anything,” he wrote in a text message. He said his intent was simply to profit from the difference between what he pays for each animal and what he can get at the slaughterhouse. Marfrig, Minerva and JBS said they did not dispatch trucks to pick up cattle at the Jaci-Paraná reserve, or any location other than their direct suppliers. Lawyers for Marfrig have also filed a report with the police that lists the events described by The Times, calling them “potential offenses of criminal nature.” Mr. Castanheira now maintains that the Times reporter witnessed the only instance of this kind of transaction by him. All three meatpacking companies said they have now excluded Mr. Castanheira from their supplier pool. Two of Bluamerica’s owners, companies named Viposa and Vancouros, said their suppliers were subject to regular audits and acknowledged the challenges of tracing indirect suppliers. Both companies said they were working with the World Wide Fund for Nature, an environmental group based in Switzerland, to improve their systems. ADVERTISEMENT Overall, an analysis of government data on cattle movement in Jaci-Paraná and nearby areas between 2018 and 2021 identified 124 transactions that show signs of cattle laundering, experts say. The transactions show at least 5,600 cattle were transferred from farms in the reserve to middlemen who, on the same day, sold cattle to the three major slaughterhouses. Holly Gibbs, a University of Wisconsin-Madison geographer who has been researching agribusiness in the Amazon for a decade, said that though legitimate middlemen often buy and sell cattle on the same day, the fact that the transactions aren’t closely tracked “is a huge loophole.” “They’re bringing animals that were raised on a protected area into national and international supply chains,” she said. The supply chain, from the ranch to the auto showroom, is complex. Hides from Minerva and JBS slaughterhouses go to JBS-owned tanneries, while Marfrig’s hides are mainly processed by Vancouros and Viposa, according to corporate data and interviews. Trade data compiled by Panjiva, the supply-chain research unit at S&P Global Market Intelligence, shows that the seat manufacturer Lear, which is based in Southfield, Mich., is the largest American buyer of hides from JBS, Vancouros and Viposa. This past May, illegal ranchers in Jaci-Paraná won a major victory. Rondônia’s governor signed into law a measure that shrank the size of the reserve by 90 percent. The law, which prosecutors are fighting in court, opens a path for ranchers on illegally deforested land to legalize their businesses. Critics of the law said it could set a precedent for further deforestation in other protected reserves. No matter the outcome of that legal fight, Mr. Durães, the rubber tapper, said he did not intend to leave his sliver of forest. The cattle pasture is now barely a mile away from his two-room wooden home. ADVERTISEMENT Living among the mighty trees is the only existence he knows. And staying, he said, is “the only way to keep the forest standing.” Every few seconds at the Vancouros tannery in southern Brazil, the sound of leather hides tumbling in dozens of 11-foot wooden drums is interrupted by the clicks of a pneumatic marker as each individual hide is pierced with a seven-digit code that traces its origin. Clébio Marques, the tannery’s commercial director, plucked a damp blue hide from a pile, pulled out his phone and typed its code into a website that his company created for its clients, such as Lear. Up popped the details of the supplier of that specific hide. “All of our leather is traceable,” he said. “This is not required, no one asked for it, but we felt the market needed more transparency.” But then Mr. Marques was presented with the finding that one of his most important suppliers, Marfrig, was buying cattle from suppliers whose transactions showed signs of cattle laundering. “I’m surprised,” he said. “We expect the main product to be legal.” He stressed, though, that his own company’s monitoring wasn’t at fault. “We have to trust the documents that are provided to us, because our audit is based on their system,” Mr. Marques said. ADVERTISEMENT All three major meatpackers have systems designed to track the last farm where the cattle they slaughter came from. However, all three have the same flaw: They don’t account for the fact that cattle don’t typically spend their whole lives on a single farm. Therefore, they don’t consider that a direct supplier might be selling cattle that were actually raised by someone else, on illegally deforested land. The tracking systems were created after a 2009 Greenpeace report that linked Brazilian beef and leather suppliers to illegal deforestation. Today, the three major firms state that they have zero-tolerance deforestation policies for all direct suppliers. All three major slaughterhouses publicly post their tracking data online. JBS’s is the most detailed; the other companies omit ranches’ precise locations. It was the Times analysis of this JBS data for 2020, the most recent year available, that indicated the company’s suppliers included ranches that may have violated government rules designed to prevent deforestation and displacement of Indigenous people. JBS said all of its suppliers were in compliance at the time of purchasing. Marfrig and Minerva said that they shared as much information about their direct suppliers as permissible under Brazil’s data privacy law. ADVERTISEMENT As part of this process, tanneries rely on an industry-funded organization, the Leather Working Group, to certify their compliance. The group has assigned its top rating, “gold,” to all the Amazon-based tanneries that supply Lear with leather, signifying that they adhere to environmentally sustainable practices. In a statement, the group said it was working to improve its traceability protocols but that “due the complexity of the farming systems in Brazil and lack of publicly available databases, there is still, unfortunately, no easy solution for this situation.” JBS, Marfrig and Minerva all have publicly pledged to improve the tracking of ranches that sell cattle to its direct suppliers. JBS has said it will trace one layer of indirect suppliers by 2025. Marfrig vowed to trace all its indirect suppliers in the Amazon by 2025 and Minerva said it would have fully traceable supply chains in South America by 2030. “Only a birth-to-slaughter traceability for individual animals is going to be enough to ensure that there is no deforestation in these high-risk supply chains in the Amazon,” said Rick Jacobsen of the Environmental Investigation Agency, the nonprofit group. The leather seats in Cadillac’s Escalade SUV, described by a dealer in Washington State as “a luxury hotel on wheels,” can push the price for General Motors’ top-of-the-line model to more than $100,000. The Escalade is one of the many vehicles sold in the United States that uses leather seats and other trimmings from Lear, a company that commands about a fifth of the world’s market in car seats. ADVERTISEMENT Neither Lear nor G.M. labels where the leather for its car seats comes from. Lear’s imports of Brazilian leather have surged over the past decade, driven by a jump in leather sourced from JBS, according to data from Panjiva, the supply-chain data company. Last year, Lear was the largest American importer of leather and hides from Brazil, importing about 6,000 tons, the bulk of that from JBS, according to Panjiva data. Full-size trucks and large SUVs are a growing force behind the demand for leather trimmings in the auto industry. To many buyers, leather “screams luxury and usually adds significant resale value,” said Drew Winter, a senior analyst at Wards Intelligence, an automotive research firm. Raymond E. Scott, Lear’s chief executive, laid out the importance of luxury vehicles at an investor presentation in June. The company has 45 percent of the luxury market, he said. And what was propelling the growth in Lear’s seating business was “really the strength of G.M.’s full-size trucks and SUVs,” a lineup that also includes the Yukon, Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban. In Brazil, “100 percent of our suppliers use geo-fencing” (a technology that uses GPS to establish a virtual fence) “to ensure they don’t buy animals from farms involved with deforestation,” Lear said in a 2018 statement. However, The Times’s findings in Brazil indicate that Lear’s suppliers didn’t have the ability to track all cattle in this way. Lear said it required all suppliers to comply with a no-deforestation policy, which bans the use of any materials sourced from illegally deforested areas or from Indigenous or other protected lands. According to corporate filings, Lear’s other biggest customers are Ford, Daimler, Volkswagen and Stellantis, formed from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and the French maker of Peugeot and Citroën cars. ADVERTISEMENT General Motors said its supply chain was “built on strong, transparent and trusted relationships.” Ford said it held itself and its suppliers to ambitious standards and “did well in many areas and can improve in others.” Volkswagen said it was working on better tracking the supply chain back to the farm. Daimler said that a small percentage of its leather came from Brazil. Stellantis said it shared concerns over traceability, and was actively working to confirm locations of tanneries and farms in its supply chain. Last year, about one-third of the 15,000 tons of leather imported to the United States came from Brazil, which recently overtook Italy to become the biggest exporter of leather and hides to America. Much of that increase can be attributed to the auto industry. The bulk of JBS’s leather shipments to Lear in the United States travels from São Paulo to Houston, according to trade data from Panjiva. From there, much of it is trucked across the Mexican border to one of two dozen car-seat factories operated by Lear in Mexico, where workers cut the hides and stitch them into seat covers. The leather is then trucked back over the border. From January 2019 through June 2021, Lear’s plants in Mexico shipped at least 1,800 tons of leather to the United States, according to trucking data tallied by Material Research. ADVERTISEMENT Its final destination: Lear facilities nationwide. They tend to be located closer to the final automobile-assembly plants, making it easier for the company to match color and other variations to the models coming down the vehicle assembly lines. One such destination is General Motors’ plant in Arlington, Texas, a sprawling campus on 250 acres where the automaker produces some of the company’s largest and most luxurious trucks, including the Escalade. Autoworkers assemble about 1,300 SUVs a day for sale in the United States as well as for export. A 10-minute drive away, Lear has a factory that makes leather seats.

" For over a decade the N.H.L. has promoted its commitment to the environment, using hockey’s birth on frozen ponds to connect the sport to the natural world and to portray its protection as a corporate imperative. But a new report questions that commitment and accuses the league of using its N.H.L. Green program to endorse refrigerants that will contribute to irreversibly warming the planet. The N.H.L. has a partnership with the chemical company Chemours that involves promoting Opteon, a group of refrigerants produced by Chemours that are used in chillers underneath the ice at rinks. A news release issued last month announced a multiyear renewal of the partnership, which began in 2018, saying the deal would provide “environmentally and economically sustainable refrigerant solutions” to ice rinks across North America. But Opteon refrigerants have a high global warming potential, especially compared with ammonia, a chemical that does not warm the planet and is already used in the chillers of thousands of ice rinks. Misleading marketing could prompt hockey rinks across the United States and Canada to adopt a refrigerant that worsens climate change, according to the report published Wednesday by the Environmental Investigation Agency U.S., a nongovernmental organization based in Washington, D.C. “The N.H.L.-Chemours partnership poses serious ethical concerns by disseminating a dangerously misleading message that it is sustainable to choose a potent greenhouse gas over a refrigerant with zero climate impact,” says the report, which was reviewed in advance by The New York Times. “The N.H.L. is using its prominent influence and platform to amplify this misinformation to communities and companies.” ADVERTISEMENT An N.H.L. spokesman said in an email on Tuesday that the league had not seen the report and declined to comment. An email from a Chemours spokesman said the company had also not yet seen the report. But based on what the Environmental Investigation Agency shared with the company ahead of publication, the Chemours spokesman said that the report appeared “misleading,” and that it “mischaracterizes” the company’s products and describes its relationship with the N.H.L. inaccurately. Thom Sueta, the spokesman, said that the company’s products have “favorable cost and safety profiles” and that the report would not deter its “efforts to help community ice rinks reduce their environmental footprint.” Though N.H.L. teams play in 32 high-profile arenas, the market Chemours is really targeting is the thousands of smaller ice rinks across North America. Once systems that use the company’s refrigerants are in those rinks, those systems are likely to be in place for a couple of decades, maintaining a market for Opteon. The news release announcing the extension of the partnership said that more than 200 rinks — including those where the San Jose Sharks and the Colorado Avalanche play, as well as the Beijing arena that will host the ice hockey competition at the Winter Olympics early next year — had switched to Opteon. The Environmental Investigation Agency calculates that if all of North America’s roughly 4,500 ice rinks switched to Opteon from ammonia, over their lifetime those systems would emit an amount of carbon dioxide equivalent to what would be generated by 15 coal-fired power plants in a year. ADVERTISEMENT Opteon refrigerants have names like XP10 and XP40 and are made of a blend of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, and hydrofluoroolefins, or HFOs. These are human-made compounds that are most commonly used in air-conditioning and refrigerator systems. “There’s a reason why these compounds have been targeted for phasedown, which is that they contribute to global warming and they’re very potent,” said Susan Solomon, a professor of atmospheric chemistry and climate science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “For every pound of it that you emit, your impact on global warming is far greater than a pound of carbon dioxide.” HFCs have been targeted for reduction by treaties and laws around the world because they contribute to global warming, and more than 120 countries, including Canada, have signed on to a treaty committing to reduce their use. The Biden administration has introduced regulations to reduce HFC use by 85 percent over the next 15 years. Business-as-usual emissions of HFCs could increase global warming by as much as half a degree by the latter part of this century, Solomon said. To stave off the most catastrophic effects of global warming, scientists say, the world must prevent the global temperature from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Though ice rink refrigeration systems might ultimately play a small role in warming, Solomon questioned the N.H.L. and Chemours’s advocacy of HFCs at a time when the world is trying to rapidly move away from them. “Personally, I love the Boston Bruins,” she said. “But it’s hard for me to make a case that they should get a special exemption” if they were to seek to switch to a new refrigerant from the ammonia that currently chills TD Garden. “And,” Solomon added, “why can’t they go directly to compounds that are already being used as substitutes?” ADVERTISEMENT The N.H.L.’s sustainability messaging now prominently features Chemours chemicals, but it wasn’t always that way. A league-issued “Greener Rinks” infographic on refrigeration systems from before 2018 endorses ammonia and carbon dioxide as natural refrigerants, saying that ammonia refrigeration systems have “significantly lower potential for ozone depletion and global warming” than HFCs and a predecessor, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or HCFCs. Matthew Rigby, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Bristol in England, said that the HFC refrigerants currently being marketed by the N.H.L. “weren’t the worst,” especially compared with compounds that were commonly used at arenas in the past. “They’re fairly nontoxic and they don’t deplete the ozone layer,” he said. “So obviously this is much more preferable, but they do still impact the climate.” The major concern about ice rink refrigeration and similar systems is that they tend to be very leaky, said Alex Hillbrand, an expert on HFCs at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental group. “That system has a bunch of connections, like metal to metal joints, which can leak,” he said. “The chiller vibrates significantly as it’s operating. And vibrations over time cause small gaps to form.” The refrigerants could also escape when these systems are ultimately disposed of, Hillbrand said, making it important for there to be programs in place to capture, collect and properly incinerate the gas. Most scientists look at how much a substance warms the planet over 100 years to understand its effect on the environment, which is called its global warming potential. While the Environmental Investigation Agency and Chemours differ slightly on the numbers, they broadly agree that the first of two refrigerants marketed as Opteon warms the atmosphere about 600 times more than the same mass of carbon dioxide over a 100-year period; the second warms the atmosphere in excess of 1,200 times more. Ammonia’s global warming potential is zero. “You’re pushing facilities away from ammonia,” Hillbrand said. “That’s a step in the wrong direction.” Chemours contends that Opteon is mostly used to replace the more harmful chemicals in older ice chiller systems, and that it reduces the global warming potential of those systems anywhere from 20 to 80 percent. Sueta, the company spokesman, said that Opteon was cost efficient for rink operators, and that while ammonia has no global warming potential, its production requires the use of fossil fuels. ADVERTISEMENT In a warming world, demand for refrigeration systems may rise as owners of small ice rinks — especially backyard versions that have traditionally relied on naturally freezing temperatures — struggle to keep the ice intact. Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle is home to the N.H.L.’s newest team, the Kraken. Amazon bought the rights to name the building after its own environmental initiative. The arena is powered by renewable sources and has a goal of diverting 97 percent of its waste from landfills. Its operator has promised to buy credits to offset any carbon produced. Environmental considerations were front and center in almost every facet of the arena’s retrofit, which cost more than $1 billion. And its ice chilling system? It uses ammonia. Rob Johnson, the head of sustainability and transportation for the Kraken, said that environmental concerns influenced the team’s decision on which chilling system to buy and that the “lower carbon footprint of an ammonia chiller compared to an HFC-based chiller was a consideration.”"
" This article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center’s Rainforest Investigations Network. BURITIS, Brazil — One morning this summer, Odilon Caetano Felipe, a rancher who raises cattle on illegally deforested land in the Amazon, met with a trader and signed over 72 newly fattened animals. With that stroke of the pen, Mr. Felipe gave his cattle a clean record: By selling them, he obscured their role in the destruction of the world’s largest rainforest. Over lunch shortly after the July 14 sale, Mr. Felipe spoke openly about the business that has made him wealthy. He acknowledged cutting down the thick Amazon forest and that he had not paid for the land. He also said he structured his sales to hide the true origins of his cattle by selling to a middleman, creating a paper trail falsely showing his animals as coming from a legal ranch. Other ranchers in the area do the same, he said. “It makes no difference,” he said, whether his farm is legal or not. A New York Times investigation into Brazil’s rapidly expanding slaughterhouse industry — a business that sells not only beef to the world, but tons of leather annually to major companies in the United States and elsewhere — has identified loopholes in its monitoring systems that allow hides from cattle kept on illegally deforested Amazon land to flow undetected through Brazil’s tanneries and on to buyers worldwide. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Felipe’s ranch is one of more than 600 that operate in an area of the Amazon known as Jaci-Paraná, a specially protected environmental reserve where deforestation is restricted. And transactions like his are the linchpins of a complex global trade that links Amazon deforestation to a growing appetite in the United States for luxurious leather seats in pickup trucks, SUVs and other vehicles sold by some of the world’s largest automakers, among them General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen. A luxury vehicle can require a dozen or more hides, and suppliers in the United States increasingly buy their leather from Brazil. While the Amazon region is one of the world’s major providers of beef, increasingly to Asian nations, the global appetite for affordable leather also means that the hides of these millions of cattle supply a lucrative international leather market valued in the hundreds of billions of dollars annually. This leather trade shows how the wealthy world’s shopping habits are tied to environmental degradation in developing nations, in this case by helping to fund destruction of the Amazon despite its valuable biodiversity and the scientific consensus that protecting it would help to slow climate change. ADVERTISEMENT To track the global trade in leather from illegal ranches in the Brazilian rainforest to the seats in American vehicles, The Times interviewed ranchers, traders, prosecutors and regulators in Brazil, and visited tanneries, ranches and other facilities. The Times spoke to participants at all levels of the illicit trade in the Jaci-Paraná Extractive Reserve, an area in Rondônia State that has been granted special protections because it is home to communities of people who, for generations, have lived off the land by tapping rubber trees. These communities are now being forced out by ranchers who want the land for cattle. Over the past decade, ranchers have significantly expanded their presence in the reserve, and today some 56 percent of it has been cleared, according to data compiled by the state environmental agency. The reporting is also based on analysis of corporate and international trade data in several countries and thousands of cattle-transport certificates issued by the Brazilian government. The certificates were obtained by the Environmental Investigation Agency, an advocacy group in Washington. The Times independently verified the certificates and separately obtained thousands of additional ones. This enabled the tracking of leather from illegal farms in the Amazon to slaughterhouses operated by Brazil’s three biggest meatpackers, JBS, Marfrig and Minerva, and then to the tanneries they supply. JBS describes itself as the world’s largest leather processor. According to Aidee Maria Moser, a retired prosecutor in Rondônia State who spent almost two decades fighting illegal ranching in the Jaci-Paraná reserve, the practice of selling animals reared in the reserve to middleman traders suggests an intent to conceal their origin. “It’s a way to give a veneer of legality to the cattle,” she said, “so slaughterhouses can deny there was anything illegal.” The problem isn’t limited to Rondônia. Last month, an audit led by prosecutors in the neighboring state of Pará, home to the second-largest cattle herd in the Amazon, found that JBS had bought 301,000 animals, amounting to 32 percent of its purchases in the state, between January 2018 and June 2019 from farms that violated commitments to prevent illegal deforestation. ADVERTISEMENT JBS disagreed with the criteria used by the prosecutors and agreed to improve its monitoring system, block suppliers flagged by the research and donate $900,000 to the state in response to the audit. To get a sense of scale of the ranches operating in vulnerable areas across the Brazilian Amazon, The Times overlaid government maps of protected Amazon land, deforested areas and farm boundaries with the locations of ranches that JBS publicly listed as supplying its slaughterhouses in 2020. An analysis showed that, among the JBS suppliers, ranches covering an estimated 2,500 square miles significantly overlapped Indigenous land, a conservation zone or an area that was deforested after 2008, when laws regulating deforestation were put in place in Brazil. The methodology and results were examined and verified by a team of independent researchers and academics who study land use in the Brazilian Amazon. International trade data showed companies that own tanneries supplied with the hides had then shipped leather to factories in Mexico run by Lear, a major seat maker that supplies auto assembly plants across the United States. Lear said in 2018 that it was then sourcing about 70 percent of its raw hides from Brazil. Brazil’s hides also go to other countries including Italy, Vietnam and China for use in the automotive, fashion and furniture industries, the trade data showed. JBS acknowledged that almost three-quarters of the ranches identified in The Times’s analysis did overlap with land that the government categorizes as illegally deforested, or as Indigenous land or a conservation zone. But it said all the ranches had been in compliance with rules to prevent deforestation when JBS bought from them. JBS said that, in those instances where there were overlaps, the farms were allowed to operate in protected or deforested areas, or their boundaries had changed, or they had followed rules to fix their environmental violations. Ranching is allowed in some protected areas in Brazil if it follows sustainable practices. In a statement, JBS said it has maintained a monitoring system for more than a decade that verifies supplier compliance with its environmental policy. “More than 14,000 suppliers have been blocked for failure to comply with this policy,” it said. However, the company said, “the great challenge for JBS, and for the beef cattle supply chain in general, is to monitor the suppliers of its suppliers, since the company has no information about them.” ADVERTISEMENT Amazon deforestation has surged in recent years as ranchers race to supply growing demand for beef, particularly in China. Leather industry representatives make the point that as long as there is demand for beef, they are simply using hides that would otherwise be sent to landfills. Raoni Rajão, who studies Amazon supply chains at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, said that because the leather industry makes ranching more profitable, it shares responsibility for any deforestation. “Leather can have high added value,” he said. Forest loss is destroying the Amazon’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide, which trees pull out of the air. Carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels is the main driver of climate change. Brazil was one of more than 100 nations to pledge to end deforestation by 2030 at the recent United Nations climate summit in Glasgow. While most ranches in the Amazon region aren’t linked to illegal deforestation, the findings show how illegal leather is entering the global supply chain, circumventing a system that slaughterhouses and leather companies themselves created in recent years to try to show that their cattle come only from legitimate ranches. ADVERTISEMENT In response to detailed questions, JBS, Marfrig and Minerva said they weren’t aware that cattle from the Jaci-Paraná reserve were entering their supply chains. All three said they had systems to monitor farms that supply their slaughterhouses directly, and that they exclude farms that don’t comply with environmental laws. But all three acknowledged that they can’t trace indirect suppliers, such as Mr. Felipe, who sell cattle through middlemen, masking their origins. Lear said it used “a robust sourcing process” that ensured it worked “with the most capable and advanced suppliers that are committed to purchasing hides from cattle reared on compliant farms.” The company said that if suppliers violated its policies, it would take steps that could include canceling their contracts “and/or legal action against the supplier.” G.M. said it expected suppliers to “comply with laws, regulations, and act in a way consistent with the principles and values” of the automaker. Ford said it aspired “to source only raw materials that are responsibly produced.” Volkswagen said its suppliers already adhered to a high level of sustainability. In Jaci-Paraná, the global demand for leather is helping to sustain a growing herd of 120,000 cattle where forest once stood. “If all the cattle were sold,” said Ms. Moser, the former prosecutor, the government would have enough money “to reforest the whole reserve.” It was pouring rain last December when two men docked at Lourenço Durães’ home by the Jaci-Paraná River. Mr. Durães, a 71-year-old rubber tapper, invited the men in and offered them coffee. Then, after discussing the weather for a few minutes, one of the visitors got right to the point. ADVERTISEMENT “I won’t fool you,” he said, according to Mr. Durães and one of his friends, who together described the meeting recently. “I came here to kill you.” They wanted to get rid of Mr. Durães because his land is valuable to ranchers. Jaci-Paraná was created in 1996 to grant a community of rubber-tree tappers the right to pursue their livelihood. Mr. Durães is among the last of the tappers. The community is being pushed out by deforestation. “We are frightened, but I hope for justice,” Mr. Durães said, adding that he believed he was spared that day because he is an old man. According to Mr. Durães and a police report filed by his friend, the would-be hit man identified the person who had sent him, but only by a nickname. The police didn’t investigate, according to the police report, because Mr. Durães and his friend couldn’t provide a full name of a person to press charges against. In an interview, Lucilene Pedrosa, who directs the regional police division, said her team was waiting for the men to provide more information so it could investigate. Government data analyzed by The Times shows the appetite for land in the area. According to the numbers, between January 2018 and June 2021 ranches operating in Jaci-Paraná on illegally deforested land sold at least 17,700 cattle to intermediate ranches. The buyers were suppliers to the three big meatpackers, JBS, Marfrig and Minerva, according to both government and corporate data. ADVERTISEMENT Almost half of those 17,700 cattle were bought by Armando Castanheira Filho, a local trader who has been one of the largest buyers in Jaci-Paraná and a direct supplier to all three major meatpackers. The sales to him created a paper trail that concealed that the cattle originated on illegal ranches. A Times reporter witnessed such a transaction when Mr. Felipe, the rancher who acknowledged engaging in deforestation, sold his 72 cattle this year. The buyer that day was Mr. Castanheira. The Times then tracked the animals. Eleven hours later, they ended up at a Marfrig slaughterhouse. Marfrig runs a website listing where its cattle come from in an effort to show that it sources cattle responsibly. For the July 14 shipment tracked by The Times, Mr. Felipe’s ranch isn’t listed on the site. But the list of farms that supplied cattle for the next day’s slaughter does include Mr. Castanheira’s farm, which is located outside the reserve. At the end of that day at the Marfrig slaughterhouse, a truck marked with the name of a tannery, Bluamerica, left the slaughterhouse carrying hides. Bluamerica is a tannery that supplies Lear, the automobile seat maker. Mr. Castanheira confirmed that some of the cattle he buys from the reserve go directly to slaughter, spending no time at his ranch, although the paperwork shows they went through his own farm first. He denied doing it to hide the cattle’s origin. ADVERTISEMENT “I don’t do this to ‘launder’ anything,” he wrote in a text message. He said his intent was simply to profit from the difference between what he pays for each animal and what he can get at the slaughterhouse. Marfrig, Minerva and JBS said they did not dispatch trucks to pick up cattle at the Jaci-Paraná reserve, or any location other than their direct suppliers. Lawyers for Marfrig have also filed a report with the police that lists the events described by The Times, calling them “potential offenses of criminal nature.” Mr. Castanheira now maintains that the Times reporter witnessed the only instance of this kind of transaction by him. All three meatpacking companies said they have now excluded Mr. Castanheira from their supplier pool. Two of Bluamerica’s owners, companies named Viposa and Vancouros, said their suppliers were subject to regular audits and acknowledged the challenges of tracing indirect suppliers. Both companies said they were working with the World Wide Fund for Nature, an environmental group based in Switzerland, to improve their systems. ADVERTISEMENT Overall, an analysis of government data on cattle movement in Jaci-Paraná and nearby areas between 2018 and 2021 identified 124 transactions that show signs of cattle laundering, experts say. The transactions show at least 5,600 cattle were transferred from farms in the reserve to middlemen who, on the same day, sold cattle to the three major slaughterhouses. Holly Gibbs, a University of Wisconsin-Madison geographer who has been researching agribusiness in the Amazon for a decade, said that though legitimate middlemen often buy and sell cattle on the same day, the fact that the transactions aren’t closely tracked “is a huge loophole.” “They’re bringing animals that were raised on a protected area into national and international supply chains,” she said. The supply chain, from the ranch to the auto showroom, is complex. Hides from Minerva and JBS slaughterhouses go to JBS-owned tanneries, while Marfrig’s hides are mainly processed by Vancouros and Viposa, according to corporate data and interviews. Trade data compiled by Panjiva, the supply-chain research unit at S&P Global Market Intelligence, shows that the seat manufacturer Lear, which is based in Southfield, Mich., is the largest American buyer of hides from JBS, Vancouros and Viposa. This past May, illegal ranchers in Jaci-Paraná won a major victory. Rondônia’s governor signed into law a measure that shrank the size of the reserve by 90 percent. The law, which prosecutors are fighting in court, opens a path for ranchers on illegally deforested land to legalize their businesses. Critics of the law said it could set a precedent for further deforestation in other protected reserves. No matter the outcome of that legal fight, Mr. Durães, the rubber tapper, said he did not intend to leave his sliver of forest. The cattle pasture is now barely a mile away from his two-room wooden home. ADVERTISEMENT Living among the mighty trees is the only existence he knows. And staying, he said, is “the only way to keep the forest standing.” Every few seconds at the Vancouros tannery in southern Brazil, the sound of leather hides tumbling in dozens of 11-foot wooden drums is interrupted by the clicks of a pneumatic marker as each individual hide is pierced with a seven-digit code that traces its origin. Clébio Marques, the tannery’s commercial director, plucked a damp blue hide from a pile, pulled out his phone and typed its code into a website that his company created for its clients, such as Lear. Up popped the details of the supplier of that specific hide. “All of our leather is traceable,” he said. “This is not required, no one asked for it, but we felt the market needed more transparency.” But then Mr. Marques was presented with the finding that one of his most important suppliers, Marfrig, was buying cattle from suppliers whose transactions showed signs of cattle laundering. “I’m surprised,” he said. “We expect the main product to be legal.” He stressed, though, that his own company’s monitoring wasn’t at fault. “We have to trust the documents that are provided to us, because our audit is based on their system,” Mr. Marques said. ADVERTISEMENT All three major meatpackers have systems designed to track the last farm where the cattle they slaughter came from. However, all three have the same flaw: They don’t account for the fact that cattle don’t typically spend their whole lives on a single farm. Therefore, they don’t consider that a direct supplier might be selling cattle that were actually raised by someone else, on illegally deforested land. The tracking systems were created after a 2009 Greenpeace report that linked Brazilian beef and leather suppliers to illegal deforestation. Today, the three major firms state that they have zero-tolerance deforestation policies for all direct suppliers. All three major slaughterhouses publicly post their tracking data online. JBS’s is the most detailed; the other companies omit ranches’ precise locations. It was the Times analysis of this JBS data for 2020, the most recent year available, that indicated the company’s suppliers included ranches that may have violated government rules designed to prevent deforestation and displacement of Indigenous people. JBS said all of its suppliers were in compliance at the time of purchasing. Marfrig and Minerva said that they shared as much information about their direct suppliers as permissible under Brazil’s data privacy law. ADVERTISEMENT As part of this process, tanneries rely on an industry-funded organization, the Leather Working Group, to certify their compliance. The group has assigned its top rating, “gold,” to all the Amazon-based tanneries that supply Lear with leather, signifying that they adhere to environmentally sustainable practices. In a statement, the group said it was working to improve its traceability protocols but that “due the complexity of the farming systems in Brazil and lack of publicly available databases, there is still, unfortunately, no easy solution for this situation.” JBS, Marfrig and Minerva all have publicly pledged to improve the tracking of ranches that sell cattle to its direct suppliers. JBS has said it will trace one layer of indirect suppliers by 2025. Marfrig vowed to trace all its indirect suppliers in the Amazon by 2025 and Minerva said it would have fully traceable supply chains in South America by 2030. “Only a birth-to-slaughter traceability for individual animals is going to be enough to ensure that there is no deforestation in these high-risk supply chains in the Amazon,” said Rick Jacobsen of the Environmental Investigation Agency, the nonprofit group. The leather seats in Cadillac’s Escalade SUV, described by a dealer in Washington State as “a luxury hotel on wheels,” can push the price for General Motors’ top-of-the-line model to more than $100,000. The Escalade is one of the many vehicles sold in the United States that uses leather seats and other trimmings from Lear, a company that commands about a fifth of the world’s market in car seats. ADVERTISEMENT Neither Lear nor G.M. labels where the leather for its car seats comes from. Lear’s imports of Brazilian leather have surged over the past decade, driven by a jump in leather sourced from JBS, according to data from Panjiva, the supply-chain data company. Last year, Lear was the largest American importer of leather and hides from Brazil, importing about 6,000 tons, the bulk of that from JBS, according to Panjiva data. Full-size trucks and large SUVs are a growing force behind the demand for leather trimmings in the auto industry. To many buyers, leather “screams luxury and usually adds significant resale value,” said Drew Winter, a senior analyst at Wards Intelligence, an automotive research firm. Raymond E. Scott, Lear’s chief executive, laid out the importance of luxury vehicles at an investor presentation in June. The company has 45 percent of the luxury market, he said. And what was propelling the growth in Lear’s seating business was “really the strength of G.M.’s full-size trucks and SUVs,” a lineup that also includes the Yukon, Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban. In Brazil, “100 percent of our suppliers use geo-fencing” (a technology that uses GPS to establish a virtual fence) “to ensure they don’t buy animals from farms involved with deforestation,” Lear said in a 2018 statement. However, The Times’s findings in Brazil indicate that Lear’s suppliers didn’t have the ability to track all cattle in this way. Lear said it required all suppliers to comply with a no-deforestation policy, which bans the use of any materials sourced from illegally deforested areas or from Indigenous or other protected lands. According to corporate filings, Lear’s other biggest customers are Ford, Daimler, Volkswagen and Stellantis, formed from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and the French maker of Peugeot and Citroën cars. ADVERTISEMENT General Motors said its supply chain was “built on strong, transparent and trusted relationships.” Ford said it held itself and its suppliers to ambitious standards and “did well in many areas and can improve in others.” Volkswagen said it was working on better tracking the supply chain back to the farm. Daimler said that a small percentage of its leather came from Brazil. Stellantis said it shared concerns over traceability, and was actively working to confirm locations of tanneries and farms in its supply chain. Last year, about one-third of the 15,000 tons of leather imported to the United States came from Brazil, which recently overtook Italy to become the biggest exporter of leather and hides to America. Much of that increase can be attributed to the auto industry. The bulk of JBS’s leather shipments to Lear in the United States travels from São Paulo to Houston, according to trade data from Panjiva. From there, much of it is trucked across the Mexican border to one of two dozen car-seat factories operated by Lear in Mexico, where workers cut the hides and stitch them into seat covers. The leather is then trucked back over the border. From January 2019 through June 2021, Lear’s plants in Mexico shipped at least 1,800 tons of leather to the United States, according to trucking data tallied by Material Research. ADVERTISEMENT Its final destination: Lear facilities nationwide. They tend to be located closer to the final automobile-assembly plants, making it easier for the company to match color and other variations to the models coming down the vehicle assembly lines. One such destination is General Motors’ plant in Arlington, Texas, a sprawling campus on 250 acres where the automaker produces some of the company’s largest and most luxurious trucks, including the Escalade. Autoworkers assemble about 1,300 SUVs a day for sale in the United States as well as for export. A 10-minute drive away, Lear has a factory that makes leather seats.

" Este reportaje fue producido en colaboración con la Red de Investigaciones de la Selva Tropical del Centro Pulitzer. BURITIS, Brasil — Una mañana de verano, Odilon Caetano Felipe, un ganadero que cría reses en tierras deforestadas de manera ilegal en la Amazonia, se reunió con un comerciante y firmó la entrega de 72 animales recién engordados. Con ese trazo del bolígrafo, Felipe le dio a su ganado un historial limpio: al venderlo, ocultó su papel en la destrucción de la mayor selva tropical del mundo. Durante el almuerzo, poco después de la venta del 14 de julio, Felipe habló abiertamente del negocio que lo ha hecho rico. Reconoció haber talado la espesa selva amazónica y que no había pagado por la tierra. También dijo que estructuró sus ventas para ocultar el verdadero origen de su ganado al vender a un intermediario y así crear un rastro de papel que muestra falsamente que sus animales provienen de un rancho legal. La mayoría de los ganaderos de la zona hacen lo mismo, dijo. “No importa”, dijo, si su granja es legal o no. Una investigación de The New York Times sobre la industria brasileña de los mataderos, en rápida expansión —un negocio que no solo vende carne de res al mundo, sino también toneladas de cuero al año a grandes empresas de Estados Unidos y otros países—, ha detectado lagunas en sus sistemas de vigilancia que permiten que el ganado procedente de tierras amazónicas deforestadas ilegalmente pase sin ser detectado por las curtiembres de Brasil y llegue a compradores de todo el mundo. ADVERTISEMENT El rancho de Felipe es una de las más de 600 propiedades que operan en una zona de la Amazonia conocida como Jaci-Paraná, una reserva medioambiental especialmente protegida donde la deforestación está restringida. Y transacciones como la suya son el eje de un complejo comercio mundial que vincula la deforestación de la Amazonia con un creciente apetito en Estados Unidos por los lujosos asientos de cuero de las camionetas, los todoterrenos y otros vehículos vendidos por algunos de los mayores fabricantes de automóviles del mundo, entre ellos General Motors, Ford y Volkswagen. Un vehículo de lujo puede necesitar una docena o más de pieles, y los proveedores estadounidenses compran cada vez más el cuero de Brasil. Aunque la región amazónica es uno de los principales proveedores de carne de res del mundo, cada vez más a las naciones asiáticas, el apetito global por el cuero asequible también significa que las pieles de estos millones de reses representan un lucrativo mercado internacional valorado en cientos de miles de millones de dólares anuales. Este comercio del cuero muestra cómo los hábitos de compra de los países más ricos del mundo pueden tener consecuencias nefastas en los países en desarrollo, en este caso al hacer rentable la destrucción de la Amazonia a pesar del consenso científico de que su protección ayudaría a frenar el cambio climático. ADVERTISEMENT Para rastrear el comercio mundial del cuero, desde los ranchos ilegales de la selva brasileña hasta los asientos de los vehículos estadounidenses, el Times entrevistó a ganaderos, comerciantes, fiscales y reguladores en Brasil, y visitó curtiembres, ranchos y otras instalaciones. El Times habló con participantes de todos los niveles del comercio ilícito en la Reserva Extractiva Jaci Paraná, una zona del estado de Rondônia a la que se ha concedido una protección especial porque está habitada por comunidades de personas que, durante generaciones, han vivido de la tierra explotando árboles de caucho. Estas comunidades están siendo expulsadas por los ganaderos que quieren la tierra para las reses. En la última década, los ganaderos han ampliado considerablemente su presencia en la reserva, y en la actualidad se ha desbrozado un 56 por ciento de la misma, según los datos recopilados por la agencia estatal de medio ambiente. El informe también se basa en el análisis de datos empresariales y de comercio internacional en varios países y en miles de certificados de transporte de ganado emitidos por el gobierno brasileño. Los certificados fueron obtenidos por la Agencia de Investigación Medioambiental, un grupo de defensa en Washington. El Times verificó de manera independiente los certificados y obtuvo por separado miles más. Esto permitió seguir el rastro del cuero desde las granjas ilegales de la Amazonia hasta los mataderos operados por los tres mayores empacadores de carne de Brasil, JBS, Marfrig y Minerva, y luego a las curtiembres a las que abastecen. JBS se describe como el mayor proveedor de cuero del mundo. Según Aidee Maria Moser, fiscal jubilada del estado de Rondônia que pasó casi dos décadas luchando contra la ganadería ilegal en la reserva de Jaci-Paraná, la práctica de vender animales criados en la reserva a comerciantes intermediarios sugiere una intención de ocultar su origen. “Es una forma de dar un barniz de legalidad al ganado”, dijo, “para que los mataderos puedan negar cualquier cosa ilegal”. El problema no se limita a Rondônia. Este mes, una auditoría dirigida por los fiscales del vecino estado de Pará, que alberga el segundo mayor rebaño de ganado de la Amazonia, descubrió que JBS había adquirido 301.000 animales, que suponen el 32 por ciento de sus compras en el estado, entre enero de 2018 y junio de 2019 a granjas que violaban los compromisos para evitar la deforestación ilegal. ADVERTISEMENT JBS no estuvo de acuerdo con los criterios empleados por los fiscales y aceptó mejorar su sistema de monitoreo, bloquear a los proveedores señalados por la investigación y donar 900.000 dólares al estado en respuesta a los hallazgos de la auditoría. Para tener una idea de la escala de los ranchos que operan ilegalmente en la Amazonia brasileña, el Times superpuso los mapas gubernamentales de las tierras amazónicas protegidas, las áreas deforestadas y los límites de las granjas con las ubicaciones de los ranchos que JBS identificó públicamente como proveedores de sus mataderos en 2020. El análisis demostró que, entre los proveedores de JBS, los ranchos que cubrían una superficie estimada de 4000 kilómetros cuadrados se superponían significativamente con tierras indígenas, una zona de conservación o un área que fue deforestada después de 2008, cuando se pusieron en marcha las leyes que regulan la deforestación en Brasil. La metodología y los resultados fueron analizados y verificados por un equipo de investigadores y académicos independientes que estudian el uso de la tierra en la Amazonia brasileña. Los datos de comercio internacional mostraron que las empresas propietarias de las curtiembres que se abastecían de las pieles luego enviaron el cuero a las fábricas de México dirigidas por Lear, un importante fabricante de asientos que suministra a las plantas de montaje de automóviles de todo Estados Unidos. Lear dijo en 2018 que alrededor del 70 por ciento de sus pieles en bruto provenían de Brasil. Los cueros también van a otros países, como Italia, Vietnam y China, para su uso en las industrias automotriz, de moda y de muebles, según mostraron los datos comerciales. JBS reconoció que casi tres cuartas partes de los ranchos identificados en el análisis del Times coincidían con tierras que el gobierno clasifica como deforestadas ilegalmente, o como territorios indígenas o zonas de conservación. Pero dijo que todas las fincas cumplían con las normas para evitar la deforestación cuando JBS les compró. JBS dijo que, en los casos en que había superposiciones, las fincas estaban autorizadas a operar en zonas protegidas o deforestadas, o sus límites habían cambiado, o habían seguido las normas para solucionar sus infracciones medioambientales. La ganadería está permitida en algunas zonas protegidas de Brasil, si cumple con las prácticas sostenibles. En un comunicado, JBS dijo que durante más de una década ha mantenido un sistema de control que verifica el cumplimiento de su política medioambiental por parte de los proveedores. “Más de 14.000 proveedores han sido bloqueados por el incumplimiento de esta política”, dijo. Sin embargo, la empresa indicó que “el gran reto para JBS, y para la cadena de suministro de ganado vacuno en general, es controlar a los proveedores de sus proveedores, puesto que la empresa no tiene información sobre ellos”. ADVERTISEMENT La deforestación de la Amazonia se ha disparado en los últimos años debido a la carrera de los ganaderos por abastecer la creciente demanda de carne de res, especialmente en China. Los responsables de la industria del cuero señalan que, mientras haya demanda de carne de res, no hacen más que usar pieles que, de otro modo, irían a parar a los rellenos sanitarios. Raoni Rajão, quien estudia las cadenas de suministro de la Amazonia en la Universidad Federal de Minas Gerais, dijo que debido a que la industria del cuero hace que la ganadería sea más rentable, comparte la responsabilidad de cualquier deforestación. “El cuero puede tener un alto valor agregado”, dijo. La pérdida de bosques está destruyendo la capacidad dela Amazonia para absorber el dióxido de carbono que los árboles extraen del aire. El dióxido de carbono que procede de la quema de combustibles fósiles es el principal impulsor del cambio climático. Brasil fue uno de los más de 100 países que se comprometieron a poner fin a la deforestación para 2030 en la reciente cumbre del clima de las Naciones Unidas celebrada en Glasgow. Aunque la mayoría de los ranchos de la región amazónica no están vinculados a la deforestación ilegal, los resultados muestran cómo el cuero ilegal está entrando en la cadena de suministro mundial, eludiendo un sistema que los mataderos y las propias empresas de cuero crearon en los últimos años para tratar de demostrar que su ganado solo proviene de ranchos legítimos. ADVERTISEMENT En respuesta a preguntas detalladas, JBS, Marfrig y Minerva dijeron que no tenían conocimiento de que el ganado de la reserva Jaci-Paraná estuviera entrando en sus cadenas de suministro. Las tres dijeron que tenían sistemas para controlar las fincas que abastecen directamente a sus mataderos y que excluyen a las granjas que no cumplen las leyes medioambientales. Y las tres reconocieron que no pueden rastrear a los proveedores indirectos, como Felipe, que venden el ganado a través de intermediarios, ocultando su origen. Lear dijo que utilizó “un sólido proceso de abastecimiento” que garantizó que trabajaba “con los proveedores más capaces y avanzados que se comprometen a comprar pieles de ganado criado en granjas que cumplen la normativa”. La empresa dijo que si los proveedores violaban sus políticas, tomaría medidas que podrían incluir la cancelación de sus contratos “y/o acciones legales contra el proveedor”. GM dijo que esperaba que sus proveedores “cumplieran las leyes y reglamentos y actuasen de forma coherente con los principios y valores” del fabricante de automóviles. Ford dijo que aspiraba a “abastecerse solo de materias primas producidas de forma responsable”. Volkswagen dijo que sus proveedores ya se adherían a un alto nivel de sostenibilidad. En Jaci-Paraná, la demanda mundial de cuero está ayudando a mantener un rebaño creciente de 120.000 cabezas de ganado donde antes había bosques. “Si se vendiera todo el ganado”, dijo Moser, la exfiscala, el gobierno tendría suficiente dinero “para reforestar toda la reserva”. ADVERTISEMENT El pasado diciembre llovía a cántaros cuando dos hombres atracaron en la casa de Lourenço Durães, junto al río Jaci-Paraná. Durães, un recolector de caucho de 71 años, invitó a los hombres a entrar y les ofreció un café. Después de hablar del clima durante unos minutos, uno de los visitantes fue al grano. “No voy a engañarte”, dijo, según Durães y uno de sus amigos, que recientemente describieron el encuentro. “Vine a matarte”. Querían deshacerse de Durães porque sus tierras son valiosas para los ganaderos. Jaci-Paraná fue creada en 1996 para conceder a una comunidad de recolectores de caucho el derecho a seguir con su medio de vida. Durães es uno de los últimos recolectores. La comunidad está siendo expulsada por la deforestación. “Estamos asustados, pero espero que se haga justicia”, dijo Durães, y añadió que creía que ese día se había librado de la amenaza porque es un hombre mayor. Según Durães y una denuncia ante la policía presentada por su amigo, el presunto asesino identificó a la persona que lo había enviado, pero solo por un apodo. La policía no investigó, según el informe policial, porque Durães y su amigo no pudieron proporcionar el nombre completo de la persona para presentar cargos. En una entrevista, Lucilene Pedrosa, que dirige la división regional de la policía, dijo que su equipo estaba esperando que los hombres proporcionen más información para poder investigar. Los datos del gobierno analizados por el Times muestran el atractivo que despierta la tierra de esa zona. Según esos datos, entre enero de 2018 y junio de 2021 los ranchos que operan en Jaci-Paraná en tierras deforestadas ilegalmente vendieron al menos 17.700 reses a ranchos intermedios. Los compradores eran proveedores de los tres grandes frigoríficos, JBS, Marfrig y Minerva, según los datos del gobierno y de las empresas. ADVERTISEMENT Casi la mitad de esas 17.700 reses fueron compradas por Armando Castanheira Filho, un comerciante local que ha sido uno de los mayores compradores de Jaci-Paraná y que es un proveedor directo de los tres grandes frigoríficos. Esas ventas crearon un rastro de papel que ocultaba que el ganado procedía de ranchos ilegales. Una reportera del Times fue testigo de una transacción de este tipo cuando Felipe —el ganadero que reconoció haber participado en la deforestación ilegal— vendió sus 72 reses este año. El comprador de ese día era Castanheira. El Times siguió el rastro de los animales. Once horas después, acabaron en un matadero de Marfrig. Marfrig tiene un sitio web en el que indica la procedencia de su ganado, en un esfuerzo por demostrar que se abastece de manera responsable. En el caso del envío del 14 de julio rastreado por el Times, el rancho de Felipe no aparece en la página web. Pero en la lista de fincas que suministraron ganado para el sacrificio del día siguiente sí figura la granja de Castanheira, que está situada afuera de la reserva. Al final de ese día en el matadero de Marfrig, un camión marcado con el nombre de una curtiembre, Bluamerica, salió del matadero llevando pieles. Bluamerica es una curtiembre que suministra a Lear, el fabricante de asientos para automóviles. ADVERTISEMENT Castanheira confirmó que algunas de las reses que compra a la reserva van directamente al matadero, sin pasar por su rancho, aunque los papeles muestran que pasaron primero por su propia finca. Negó que lo hiciera para ocultar el origen del ganado. “No lo hago para ‘blanquear’ nada”, escribió en un mensaje de texto. Dijo que su intención era simplemente beneficiarse de la diferencia entre lo que paga por cada animal y lo que puede obtener en el matadero. Marfrig, Minerva y JBS dijeron que no enviaban camiones para recoger el ganado en la reserva de Jaci-Paraná, ni en ningún otro lugar que no fueran sus proveedores directos. Los abogados de Marfrig también han presentado un informe a la policía que enumera los hechos descritos por el Times, calificándolos como “posibles delitos de carácter penal”. Castanheira sostiene que la reportera del Times fue testigo del único caso de este tipo de transacciones por su parte. Las tres empresas cárnicas dijeron que ahora han excluido a Castanheira de su grupo de proveedores. ADVERTISEMENT Dos de los propietarios de Bluamerica, las empresas Viposa y Vancouros, afirmaron que sus proveedores eran objeto de auditorías periódicas y reconocieron las dificultades que plantea el seguimiento de los proveedores indirectos. Ambas empresas dijeron que estaban trabajando con el Fondo Mundial para la Naturaleza, un grupo medioambiental con sede en Suiza, para mejorar sus sistemas. En general, un análisis de los datos del gobierno sobre los movimientos de ganado en Jaci-Paraná entre 2018 y 2021 identificó 124 transacciones que muestran signos de “lavado de ganado”, dicen los expertos. Las transacciones muestran que al menos 5600 reses fueron transferidas de granjas en la reserva a intermediarios que, en el mismo día, vendieron ganado a los tres principales mataderos. Holly Gibbs, geógrafa de la Universidad de Wisconsin-Madison que lleva una década investigando el agronegocio en la Amazonía, dijo que, aunque los intermediarios legítimos suelen comprar y vender ganado el mismo día, el hecho de que las transacciones no se sigan de cerca es “una enorme laguna”. “Están introduciendo animales criados en una zona protegida en las cadenas de suministro nacionales e internacionales”, dijo. La cadena de suministros, desde los ranchos hasta los concesionarios, es compleja. Las pieles de los mataderos de Minerva y JBS van a las curtiembres propiedad de JBS, mientras que las de Marfrig son procesadas principalmente por Vancouros y Viposa, según los datos corporativos y las entrevistas. Los datos comerciales recopilados por Panjiva, la unidad de investigación de la cadena de suministro de S&P Global Market Intelligence, muestran que el fabricante de asientos Lear, con sede en Southfield, Míchigan, es el mayor comprador estadounidense de pieles de JBS, Vancouros y Viposa. El pasado mes de mayo, los ganaderos ilegales de Jaci-Paraná lograron una importante victoria. El gobernador de Rondônia firmó una ley que reduce el tamaño de la reserva en un 90 por ciento. La ley, contra la que los fiscales están luchando en los tribunales, abre una vía para que los ganaderos de las tierras deforestadas ilegalmente puedan legalizar sus negocios. Los críticos de esa medida dicen que podría sentar un precedente para una mayor deforestación en otras reservas protegidas. ADVERTISEMENT Sea cual sea el resultado de esa lucha legal, Durães, el recolector de caucho, dijo que no tenía intención de abandonar su trozo de bosque. El pasto para el ganado ya llega a un kilómetro y medio de su casa de madera de dos habitaciones. Vivir entre los poderosos árboles es la única existencia que conoce. Y quedarse, dijo, es “la única manera de mantener el bosque en pie”. Cada pocos segundos, en la curtiembre Vancouros, al sur de Brasil, el sonido de las pieles cayendo en docenas de tambores de madera de tres metros se ve interrumpido por los chasquidos de un marcador neumático cuando cada piel es perforada con un código de siete dígitos que traza su origen. Clébio Marques, director comercial de la curtiembre, sacó una piel azul húmeda de una pila, sacó su teléfono y tecleó su código en el sitio web que su empresa creó para sus clientes, como Lear. Luego aparecieron los datos del proveedor de esa piel en concreto. “Todo nuestro cuero es rastreable”, dijo. “Esto no es obligatorio, nadie lo pidió, pero pensamos que el mercado necesitaba más transparencia”. Pero entonces a Marques se le presentó la constatación de que uno de sus proveedores más importantes, Marfrig, compraba ganado a proveedores cuyas transacciones mostraban indicios de blanqueo de ganado. “Estoy sorprendido”, dijo. “Esperamos que el producto principal sea legal”. ADVERTISEMENT Sin embargo, subrayó que la vigilancia de su propia empresa no era culpable. “Tenemos que confiar en los documentos que nos proporcionan, porque nuestra auditoría se basa en su sistema”, dijo Marques. Los tres principales empacadores de carne tienen sistemas diseñados para rastrear la última granja de la que procede el ganado que sacrifican. Sin embargo, los tres tienen el mismo defecto: no tienen en cuenta el hecho de que el ganado no suele pasar toda su vida en una sola granja. Por lo tanto, no consideran que un proveedor directo pueda estar vendiendo ganado que en realidad fue criado por otra persona, en tierras deforestadas ilegalmente. Los sistemas de seguimiento se crearon tras una investigación de Greenpeace en 2009 que vinculaba a los proveedores brasileños de carne y cuero con la deforestación ilegal. En la actualidad, las tres grandes empresas declaran que tienen políticas de tolerancia cero con la deforestación para todos sus proveedores directos. Los tres principales mataderos publican sus datos de seguimiento en internet. El de JBS es el más detallado; las otras empresas omiten la ubicación exacta de los ranchos. Fue el análisis del Times de estos datos de JBS para 2020, el año más reciente disponible, el que indicó que los proveedores de la empresa incluían ranchos que podrían haber violado las normas gubernamentales diseñadas para evitar la deforestación y el desplazamiento de los pueblos indígenas. ADVERTISEMENT JBS afirmó que todos sus proveedores cumplían las normas en el momento de la compra. Marfrig y Minerva dijeron que compartían toda la información sobre sus proveedores directos que permite la ley de privacidad de datos de Brasil. Como parte de este proceso, las curtidurías se apoyan en una organización financiada por la industria, el Leather Working Group, para certificar su cumplimiento. El grupo ha asignado su máxima calificación, “oro”, a todas las curtiembres de la Amazonia que suministran cuero a Lear, lo que significa que se adhieren a prácticas ambientalmente sostenibles. En un comunicado, el grupo dijo que estaba trabajando para mejorar sus protocolos de trazabilidad, pero que “debido a la complejidad de los sistemas de cría en Brasil y la falta de bases de datos disponibles públicamente, todavía no hay, por desgracia, una solución fácil para esta situación”. JBS, Marfrig y Minerva se han comprometido públicamente a mejorar el seguimiento de los ranchos que venden ganado a sus proveedores directos. JBS ha dicho que rastreará una capa de proveedores indirectos para 2025. Marfrig se comprometió a rastrear a todos sus proveedores indirectos en la Amazonia para 2025 y Minerva dijo que tendría cadenas de suministro totalmente rastreables en Sudamérica para 2030. “Solo un seguimiento desde el nacimiento hasta el sacrificio de los animales individuales puede garantizar que no hay deforestación en estas cadenas de suministro de alto riesgo en la Amazonía”, dijo Rick Jacobsen, de la Agencia de Investigación Ambiental, el grupo sin fines de lucro. Los asientos de cuero del todoterreno Escalade de Cadillac, descrito por un concesionario del estado de Washington como “un hotel de lujo sobre ruedas”, pueden elevar el precio del modelo de primera línea de General Motors a más de 100.000 dólares. ADVERTISEMENT El Escalade es uno de los muchos vehículos que se venden en Estados Unidos y que usan asientos de cuero y otros accesorios de Lear, una empresa que domina una quinta parte del mercado mundial de asientos para automóviles. Ni Lear ni GM etiquetan la procedencia del cuero para los asientos de sus carros. Las importaciones de cuero brasileño de Lear han aumentado durante la última década, impulsadas por un aumento del cuero procedente de JBS, según Panjiva, la empresa de datos sobre la cadena de suministro. El año pasado, Lear fue el mayor importador estadounidense de cuero y pieles de Brasil, importando unas 6000 toneladas, gran parte de ellas de JBS, según los datos de Panjiva. Los camiones de gran tamaño y los grandes todoterrenos son una fuerza creciente detrás de la demanda de acesorios de cuero en la industria del automóvil. Para muchos compradores, el cuero “grita lujo y suele añadir un importante valor de reventa”, dijo Drew Winter, analista principal de Wards Intelligence, una empresa de investigación de automóviles. Raymond E. Scott, director general de Lear, expuso la importancia de los vehículos de lujo en una presentación a los inversores en junio. La empresa tiene el 45 por ciento del mercado de lujo, dijo. Y lo que estaba impulsando el crecimiento del negocio de asientos de Lear era “realmente la fuerza de los todoterreno y los camiones de tamaño completo de GM”, un elenco que también incluye la Yukon, la Chevrolet Tahoe y la Suburban. En Brasil, “el 100 por ciento de nuestros proveedores utilizan el geo-cercado” (una tecnología que utiliza el GPS para establecer una valla virtual) “para asegurarse de que no compran animales de granjas involucradas con la deforestación”, dijo Lear en un comunicado de 2018. Sin embargo, los hallazgos del Times en Brasil indican que los proveedores de Lear no tenían la capacidad de rastrear todo el ganado de esta manera. Lear dijo que exigía a todos los proveedores que cumplieran con una política de no deforestación, que prohíbe el uso de cualquier material proveniente de áreas deforestadas ilegalmente o de tierras indígenas u otras protegidas. Según los archivos corporativos, los otros clientes más importantes de Lear son Ford, Daimler, Volkswagen y Stellantis, formada por la fusión de Fiat Chrysler y el fabricante francés de autos Peugeot y Citroën. ADVERTISEMENT General Motors dijo que su cadena de suministros estaba “construida sobre relaciones sólidas, transparentes y de confianza”. Ford dijo que se exigía a sí misma y a sus proveedores unos estándares ambiciosos y que “lo hizo bien en muchas áreas y puede mejorar en otras”. Volkswagen dijo que trabajaba en un mejor seguimiento de la cadena de suministro hasta la granja. Daimler dijo que un pequeño porcentaje de su cuero procedía de Brasil. Stellantis afirmó que compartía la preocupación por la rastreabilidad, y que trabajaba activamente para confirmar la ubicación de las curtiembres y las granjas en su cadena de suministro. El año pasado, alrededor de un tercio de las 15.000 toneladas de cuero importadas a Estados Unidos procedían de Brasil, que recientemente superó a Italia para convertirse en el mayor exportador de cuero y pieles a Estados Unidos. Gran parte de ese aumento puede atribuirse a la industria del automóvil. La mayor parte de los envíos de cuero de JBS a Lear en Estados Unidos viaja desde São Paulo a Houston, según datos comerciales de Panjiva. Desde allí, gran parte se transporta por camión a través de la frontera mexicana hasta una de las dos docenas de fábricas de asientos de automóviles que Lear tiene en México, donde los trabajadores cortan y cosen las pieles para hacer cubreasientos. ADVERTISEMENT Luego, el cuero vuelve a transportarse por la frontera. Desde enero de 2019 hasta junio de 2021, las plantas de Lear en México enviaron unas 1800 toneladas de cuero a Estados Unidos, según los datos de transporte por camión contabilizados por Material Research. Su destino final: las instalaciones de Lear en todo el país. Suelen estar situadas más cerca de las plantas de ensamblaje final de automóviles, lo que facilita que la empresa pueda adaptar el color y otras variaciones a los modelos que salen de la línea de montaje de vehículos. Uno de estos destinos es la planta de General Motors en Arlington, Texas, un extenso campus de más de 100 hectáreas en el que el fabricante de automóviles produce algunos de los vehículos más grandes y lujosos de la empresa, como el Escalade. Los trabajadores automotrices ensamblan unos 1300 todoterrenos al día para vender en Estados Unidos y para exportar. A diez minutos en carro, Lear tiene una fábrica que confecciona asientos de cuero.

" The first time fashion got anywhere near an official United Nations climate conference like the one just held in Glasgow was in 2009. That was COP15 (COP stands for “conference of the parties”), and it was held in Copenhagen. I write “near” a COP because back then fashion was not considered central to the climate conversation. It wasn’t, somehow, serious enough. Fashion was so marginalized, in fact, that in order to talk about its role in creating, and fighting, climate change, it had to hold its own conference. And so the Copenhagen Fashion Summit, which focuses on sustainability, was born. It took more than a decade, but things have changed. There has been a lot of talk this year about financial bigwigs finally coming to the COP table, but this is the first year that fashion had a meaningful, extended presence. As Stella McCartney, who created a special “Future of Fashion” materials exhibition at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery said, after almost two decades of pushing fashion to acknowledge its effect on the environment, she was a “COP virgin” no longer. Here’s what else stuck with me from COP26. Smack in the middle of the Blue Zone (the official delegate area — that is, the one where world leaders spoke), there was an installation by a fashion collective called Generation of Waste made to mimic a bar chart of the various stages of textile waste, from design through raw materials, garment production and so on. ADVERTISEMENT The United Nations Environment Program released a new version of the fashion charter initially created in 2018, now with 130 signatory companies, including, for the first time, LVMH, and with stronger commitments to halve carbon emissions by 2030 (and reach net zero by 2050). On the fringe, Federico Marchetti, the former Yoox Net a Porter chairman, unveiled a digital ID created by the fashion task force of Prince Charles’s Sustainable Markets Initiative: a scannable garment tag that acts like a DNA trace for a product’s manufacturing history, using blockchain technology. And Textile Exchange, an NGO that sounds like a fabric trading post but actually focuses on creating global standards in fashion, presented a trade policy request to national governments supported by 50 brands. That is an unsexy term for a plea to create tariff and import-export structures that incentivize companies to use “environmentally preferred materials” rather than, say, polyester. Which is, by the way, the most used material in the entire fashion industry. No one uttered the now discredited but formerly very popular “fashion is the second most polluting industry on the planet” fake stat. Everyone has finally agreed it’s one of the worst, and that’s plenty bad enough. Degrowth: meaning to make less product. Meaning the action taken in response to the fact that in the first 15 years of this century, clothing production doubled in volume, but the number of times a garment was worn before being thrown away decreased 36 percent. For a long time the response to this kind of data was to urge consumers to “buy less!” and “wear longer!” Now it seems that brands have owned up to their role in the problem. ADVERTISEMENT That said, it’s hard to imagine Bernard Arnault of LVMH or Ralph Lauren standing up at their annual shareholders meeting and announcing that their strategy for 2022 is “degrowth.” (It almost sounds like a potential “Saturday Night Live” skit.) Except that Halide Alagöz, the chief sustainability officer of Ralph Lauren, revealed during a New York Times Climate Hub panel that the brand had secretly been trying it out. Yup: Ralph Lauren has been practicing degrowth. Not that they call it that, exactly. The company calls it “financial growth through degrowth of resources,” according to Ms. Alagöz. Which is a terrible name for an interesting initiative, but Lauren is working on it. What it discovered was that it could decouple production from profits, so that even as the company made less stuff, it was able to make money — largely by maximizing its understanding of sell-through. It ended up with less wasted product that had to be downstreamed to outlet stores. “We have seen our financials getting better although we produce less units compared to five years ago,” Ms. Alagöz said. Designers are also getting creative when it comes to product that exists in the world. One of my favorite points came from William McDonough, an author of “Cradle to Cradle,” a sort of founding manifesto on the circular economy, who pointed out that we should think of garments as source materials that can be re-sourced for second and third use. ADVERTISEMENT This is exactly what the British designer Priya Ahluwalia was thinking when she teamed up with Microsoft to create a platform called Circulate, which allows consumers to send their own used clothes to her company. If the clothes are in acceptable condition, they will get remade and incorporated into her next collection, and the donor will get “reward points” toward a new purchase with the brand. It’s a sourcing hack Ms. Ahluwalia said has opened up a whole new channel for fabric and ideas for her. It’s a growing buzzword in fashion, thanks to regenerative agriculture, a farming technique that helps to restore soil health and nutrients. One of the less discussed aspects of fashion is just how intertwined it is with agriculture — many brands are now investing in supporting regenerative farming — but the word has jumped its tracks and filtered up to companies that boast about a “regenerative strategy” and “regenerative tactics,” which seems to mean … well, it's not clear what it means. But it sounds good, right? This is the sort of fuzzy language that can lead to charges of greenwashing, which is why Textile Exchange is working on a specific definition, out next year. Honestly, they could expand the definition to encompass a whole lexicon of fashion so everyone would be using the same language. For example, another word I bet we will hear more of comes courtesy of a McKinsey report: “nearshoring,” which is to say using suppliers that are not necessarily in your country but are not halfway around the world. After all, according to a presentation by the British brand Bamford, the average merino wool sweater journeys 18,000 miles during its production cycle, from raw material to factory to atelier to shop. A project for COP27, perhaps."
" The travel industry has reached a turning point. As thousands of scientists, government officials and business leaders met in Glasgow over the past two weeks for the pivotal United Nations climate conference, hundreds of members of the trillion-dollar tourism industry came together and made the first commitment toward a shared road map to cut carbon emissions in half by 2030 and reach “net zero” by 2050. More than 300 global travel stakeholders, including tour operators, tourism boards and hotel chains, have signed the Glasgow Declaration on Climate Action in Tourism, requiring them to submit a concrete and transparent plan within 12 months. While the details have yet to be put forward, the companies and countries that signed on, from Germany railway company Deutsche Bahn AG to the country of Panama, will be expected to disclose their carbon emissions and offer clear strategies for how to reduce them. The process is being spearheaded by the U.N. World Tourism Organization and the World Travel & Tourism Council, two industry bodies that have previously sparred on climate matters. “This is undoubtedly the biggest climate commitment our industry has come together for,” said Jeremy Smith, the co-founder of Tourism Declares a Climate Emergency, an initiative that supports climate action and provided the framework for the Glasgow Declaration. “Our initiative launched two years ago because the industry had no collective plan, and we did well getting over 400 tourism organizations on board without funding,” he said. “But the Glasgow Declaration builds on our work. It’s the coming together of major players in our sector and it’s owned by everyone who has signed it, establishing collective responsibility.” ADVERTISEMENT The travel industry is a large contributor to global carbon emissions, with a footprint estimated between 8 and 11 percent of total greenhouse gases, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council, or W.T.T.C. Aviation alone represents around 17 percent of total travel carbon emissions. Each year, a growing number of destinations and communities heavily dependent on tourism — countries like Thailand, India and Madagascar — are hit hard by the impacts of climate change, in the form of rising sea levels, drought, wildfires, deforestation and biodiversity loss. The pandemic spotlighted the adverse impact of industry growth and overtourism on Venice, Bali and other popular destinations, forcing some places to take stock and pivot toward more sustainable and environmentally friendly business models. Yet with most operators and destinations reeling from the industry shutdown last year, it is unclear how many of those plans will be prioritized over the need for fast recovery. “We need a cultural change and we need to move beyond the traditional growth-oriented mind-sets to see a more sustainable, responsible and climate-neutral tourism ecosystem,” said Patrick Child, deputy director general of environment at the European Commission. We asked readers to tell us about the spots that have delighted, inspired and comforted them in a dark year. Here, 52 of the more than 2,000 suggestions we received, to remind us that the world still awaits. The declaration has four main targets: measurement, requiring companies to disclose all travel- and tourism-related emissions; decarbonization, by setting targets aligned with climate science; regeneration, to restore and protect natural ecosystems; and collaboration, to ensure best practices are shared and financing is available to follow through. ADVERTISEMENT A recent analysis by the W.T.T.C. of 250 travel businesses found that only 42 percent had publicly announced climate targets and many of them were not based on the latest science. The council last week published a road map for different industries within travel, providing concrete guidance on how to reach “net zero” targets by 2050. “There has been a lot of apathy, with some people not quite sure about what they need to do and how to do it, or some thinking they are not significant enough, and that’s why it’s really important for larger organizations to show the way,” said Darrell Wade, the co-founder and chairman of Intrepid Travel, the only global tour company with a climate target verified by the Science Based Targets initiative, which promotes best practices in emissions reductions in line with climate science. Joining Deutsche Bahn and Panama in signing the Glasgow Declaration are big companies like Accor, Skyscanner, The Travel Corporation and Iberostar Group, as well as countries that are already affected by climate change, including Norway and Barbados. Signatories hope that more destinations will participate in the coming weeks. Throughout his experience in the Tourism Declares a Climate Emergency initiative, Mr. Smith found it easier to get smaller, more agile companies and smaller countries involved. When it came to larger companies, there were more barriers and obstacles, he said. “When you reach a destination, or even a city, it becomes even harder because there are multiple different players with different interests at the scale of a country,” he said. “It takes time.” Panama, one of only three carbon-negative countries in the world (meaning that it absorbs more carbon emissions than it emits), has taken a lead role in establishing initiatives for economic growth in tourism, which also benefit and preserve local communities and resources. “Our main plan for our sustainable tourism market is to empower local communities, particularly Indigenous people, so that they can generate an income through tourism that allows them to preserve their ancestral way of life, allowing them to sustainably manage their natural resources like forests and coral reefs,” said Ivan Eskildsen, Panama’s tourism minister. ADVERTISEMENT He pointed to an example of a trail that was built in a national park that was designed to involve local communities in the active management of the area. “Over 30 percent of our land and sea are preserved national parks, so it’s humanly impossible to supervise all these areas,” he said. “The community can benefit economically from these areas and will also be prone to stay and take care of it instead of only coming there for short-term income.” Visit Scotland, that country’s national tourism organization, which helped draft the declaration, has also taken a lead role. The organization has reduced its own carbon emission by 74 percent since 2008, and more than 850 local businesses have been given green tourism awards for their sustainability efforts. While the Glasgow Declaration has garnered great momentum and established common objectives, challenges lie ahead, especially when it comes to setting a global standard for reporting emissions figures for such a wide range of sectors within the industry, from tour operators to destinations, and airlines to cruise ships. Signatories are expected to hold each other accountable and set common standards throughout international supply chains. Once action plans have been submitted within the next year, a reporting framework will be necessary. Anyone who fails to submit a road map within that time frame will be removed from the declaration. “It is really important to bring value chains together,” said Catherine Dolton, the chief sustainability officer at IHG Hotels and Resorts. “Hotel developers, hotel owners, investors, franchisees, as well as the operators, are all impacting sustainability at different stages of the hotel life cycle.” Visibly absent from the list of signatories were members of the cruise industry. The sector made a separate pledge to pursue carbon-neutral cruising by 2050 and reduce emissions 40 percent by 2030 in an annual environmental report, published last week by the industry trade group, Cruise Line International Association. While the report makes detailed commitments to reducing the cruise industry’s carbon footprint using new technology and alternative fuels, it does not address other environmental issues such as discharge of waste. “Despite technical advances and some surveillance programs, cruising remains a major source of air, water (fresh and marine) and land pollution affecting fragile habitats, areas and species, and a potential source of physical and mental human health risks,” according to a recent report by the Marine Pollution Bulletin Journal. ADVERTISEMENT Though there was some disappointment about the limited participation of some industries in the pledge, the overall sentiment was one of optimism and a belief that the declaration would lead to real change and less “greenwashing,” a term used to describe companies that try to portray themselves as more environmentally minded than they actually are. “I’ve long been quite pessimistic about travel and tourism’s approach toward climate change,” said Mr. Wade of Intrepid Travel, which recently published a tool kit, available online, to help travel businesses measure and reduce their carbon emissions. “But now I’m really very optimistic because there is broad-level support from the industry to actually reduce emissions, and it’s the first time I’ve seen real concrete commitments from industry and governments.” Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

" The River Thames, the tidal artery that squiggles through central London, holds up a mirror to life on dry land: scraggly remains of fir trees float by after Christmas; in the first days of a fresh year, bobbing champagne bottles hint at recent revelry. Lara Maiklem, author of “Mudlark: In Search of London’s Past Along the River Thames,” scours the shoreline for artifacts such as coins, tokens, buckles and potsherds, some dating to the period of Roman rule. Loosed from pockets or heaped as infill, these are the flotsam of centuries lived on London’s streets. “I find stuff because humans are litterbugs,” Ms. Maiklem said. “We’ve always been chucking things into the river.” But lately Ms. Maiklem is encountering a type of garbage she hadn’t seen there before: the remnants of Covid 19-era personal protective equipment (or P.P.E.), particularly masks and plastic gloves bloated with sand and resting in the rubbly silt. ADVERTISEMENT Ms. Maiklem once counted around 20 gloves while canvassing 100 yards of shoreline. She wasn’t surprised; if anything, she had feared the shore would be even more inundated with pieces that had flown from pockets or trash cans or swirled into the Victorian sewers. Happily, Ms. Maiklem said, the carpet of Covid-inspired trash at the edge of the Thames wasn’t nearly as plush as it is elsewhere. P.P.E. litter is fouling landscapes across the globe. Dirtied masks and gloves tumbleweed across city parks, streets and shores in Lima, Toronto, Hong Kong and beyond. Researchers in Nanjing, China, and La Jolla, Calif., recently calculated that 193 countries have generated more than 8 million tons of pandemic-related plastic waste, and the advocacy group OceansAsia estimated that as many as 1.5 billion face masks could wind up in the marine environment in a single year. Since January, volunteers with the Ocean Conservancy’s International Coastal Cleanup have plucked 109,507 pieces of P.P.E. from the world’s watery margins. ADVERTISEMENT Now, across the litter-strewn planet, scientists, officials, companies and environmentalists are attempting to tally and repurpose P.P.E. — and limit the trash in the first place. Todd Clardy, a marine scientist in Los Angeles, sometimes counts the P.P.E. he sees on the 10-minute walk from his apartment in Koreatown to the Metro station. One day this month, he said, he spotted “24 discarded masks, two rubber gloves and loads of hand sanitation towelettes.” Sometimes he sees them atop grates that read, “No Dumping, Drains to Ocean.” Dr. Clardy suspects some masks simply slip from wrists. “Once it falls on the ground, people probably look at it like, ‘Huh, I’m not wearing that again.’” Breezes likely free some from trash cans, too. “The bins are always full,” Dr. Clardy added. “So even if you wanted to put it on top, it would fly away.” Dr. Clardy’s accounting isn’t part of a formal project, but there are several such undertakings underway. In the Netherlands, Liselotte Rambonnet, a biologist at Leiden University, and Auke-Florian Hiemstra, a biologist at Naturalis Biodiversity Center, keep a running count of masks and gloves littering streets and canals. They track animals’ interactions with the castoff gear. Among their documented examples are an unfortunate perch trapped in the thumb of a phlegmy-looking latex glove, and birds weaving P.P.E. into nesting materials, risking entanglement. “Nowadays it would be difficult to find a coot nest in the canals of Amsterdam without a face mask,” Ms. Rambonnet and Mr. Hiemstra wrote in an email. The researchers maintain a global website, Covidlitter.com, where anyone can report animal and P.P.E. incidents. Dispatches include sightings of a brown fur seal tangled in a face mask in Namibia; a mask-snarled puffin found dead on an Irish beach; and a sea turtle in Australia with a mask in its stomach. Back home, the researchers, who also lead canal cleanups in Leiden, worry P.P.E. trash will increase now that the Dutch government has reinstated mask requirements. “Every weekend we encounter face masks — new ones and old, discolored ones,” Ms. Rambonnet and Mr. Hiemstra wrote. “Some are barely recognizable, and blend in with autumn leaves.” ADVERTISEMENT Cleanup efforts are also underway in London, where staff members and volunteers with the environmental group Thames21 count and collect trash from the river’s banks. In September, the group closely surveyed more than a kilometer of shore and found P.P.E. at 70 percent of their study sites — and notably clustered along a portion of the Isle of Dogs, where 30 pieces pocked a 100-meter stretch. “I don’t remember seeing any face masks until the pandemic; they weren’t on our radar,” said Debbie Leach, the group’s chief executive officer, who has been involved since 2005. Ms. Leach’s team sends the P.P.E. to incinerators or landfills, but small bits are surely left behind because the trash “releases plastics into the water that can’t be retrieved,” she said. Researchers in Canada recently estimated that a single surgical-style mask on a sandy shoreline could unleash more than 16 million microplastics, far too small to collect and haul away. Roaming sandy swaths along Chile’s coast, Martin Thiel, a marine biologist at the Universidad Católica del Norte in Coquimbo, saw plenty of signs asking visitors to mask up — but few instructions about ditching used coverings. To his frustration, masks were scattered, swollen with sand and water and tangled in algae. “They act a little like Velcro,” he said. “They very quickly accumulate stuff.” But a few beaches, including one in Coquimbo, had trash cans designated specifically for P.P.E. Unlike oil-drum-style alternatives nearby, some had triangular tops with tiny, circular openings that would deter rummaging and prevent wind from tousling the garbage. ADVERTISEMENT In a paper published in Science of the Total Environment this year, Dr. Thiel and 11 collaborators recommended that communities install more purpose-built receptacles like these, as well as signs reminding people to consider the landscape and their neighbors, human and otherwise. “We think there is more to the story than, ‘just protect yourself,’” said Dr. Thiel, the paper’s lead author. Houston has already started. In September 2020, the city launched an anti-litter campaign partly aimed at P.P.E. Featuring images such as a filthy mask on grass, the posters read “Don’t Let Houston Go to Waste” and encouraged residents to “Do the PPE123,” choreography that entailed social distancing, wearing masks and throwing them away. Early in the pandemic, “we weren’t sure if [P.P.E.] was a safety concern and would spread Covid around the city,” said Martha Castex-Tatum, the city’s vice mayor pro tem, who spearheaded the initiative. As a clearer picture of transmission emerged, the effort “became a beautification project,” she said. The images were plastered on billboards, sports stadium jumbotrons and trash-collection trucks. Council members handed out 3,200 trash grabber tools and urged residents to use them. As the pandemic bloomed across South Africa, shoppers grabbed fistfuls of wet wipes as they entered stores, draping the cloths over shopping cart handles while roaming aisles, said Annette Devenish, marketing manager at Sani-touch, a brand that supplies many national Shoprite Group supermarkets with wipes for customer use. Sani-touch found that usage soared 500 percent early on and has fallen, but still hovers above prepandemic figures. Environmentalists often rail on wet wipes, many of which snarl sewer systems when they are flushed down drains and degrade into microplastics that drift through food webs. (Thames21, for instance, is backing newly proposed legislation that would ban all wipes containing plastic.) ADVERTISEMENT Ms. Devenish said that manufacturers ought to focus on making them recyclable or compostable, and this fall Sani-touch launched a project to give used wipes a second life. Customers can drop off cloths before leaving the store; recycling companies  will turn the polypropylene cloths into plastic pallets for use in Sani-touch’s manufacturing facilities. Fashioned from many materials, including metal and elastic, single-use masks can be harder to recycle, Ms. Devenish said, but she hopes they can be stuffed into plastic bottles to become “ecobricks,” low-cost building blocks of benches, tables, trash bins and more. P.P.E. recycling schemes are also advancing elsewhere. In the Indian city of Pune, the CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory is teaming up with a bio-medical waste facility and private companies to pilot ways to transform head-to-toe protective wear into plastic pellets used to manufacture other goods. (None are yet being made and sold, “but hopefully soon,” wrote Harshawardhan V. Pol, a principal scientist, in an email.) In fall 2020, the Canadian government asked companies to pitch ideas for recycling P.P.E. or making it compostable. The government  may funnel up to $1 million each toward a few prototypes. Preventing P.P.E. from polluting urban environments will be a boon to the spaces where residents have sought solace. “In stressful times, people seek out these places, but they’ve been pretty bad about taking rubbish and trash away with them,” said Ms. Leach of Thames21. “Masks blow hither and thither,” she added, “and finally come to rest when they hit a patch of water,” grass or sidewalk, where they too often remain."

" This article is part of a special report on Climate Solutions, which looks at efforts around the world to make a difference. The climate conference in Scotland, known as COP26, concluded last week with an assortment of promises and agreements from participating nations on confronting climate change. How they will ultimately turn out is anyone’s guess. But among the participants — both at the conference and on the streets in protest — were young people, who are likely to face the most significant effects of a changing climate, if predictions for the coming decades prove true. Before the conference, we asked five of the participants in a Generation Climate program convened by The New York Times for their thoughts on the issues, why they had become involved and what steps make a difference. Excerpts from their written responses have been edited and condensed. Bruno Rodríguez, 21, Argentina Founder and leader of Youth for Climate (Jóvenes por el Clima) Argentina, part of the youth movement Fridays for Future I was meeting in 2019 with a group of high school students in what eventually would become Youth for Climate Argentina. We met with Indigenous leaders from the north and they were narrating their experiences fighting the destruction of ancestral ecosystems (native woods specifically). They told us that, in order to prevent the bulldozers from moving forward, they put a pregnant woman in front of the machine. They protected their territory with their own bodies. That story was concrete proof: Climate change and environmental issues do not affect us all in the same way. Indigenous communities and vulnerable sectors of society receive the worst impacts. I was 18 years old, and that experience shaped my activist life. ADVERTISEMENT Vanessa Nakate, 24, Uganda Climate activist from Uganda and founder of the Africa-based Rise Up Movement Around the time I was finishing university, I became deeply interested in the climate crisis. I was inspired by my father, who has always been involved in community initiatives, to find out what the biggest issues facing my community were, so that I could do something to help. While doing my research, I kept coming back to the climate crisis. It seemed to be the cause of so much suffering in my country, Uganda — which is funny because no one was really talking about it. That’s when I knew I had to take action, so I started protesting in January 2019. John Paul Jose, 24, India Deputy director general of Zero Hour Southeast Asia, a youth-led movement that provides training and resources for young people seeking to take climate action Knowing about climate change and how it was impacting the world provided a focus. In 2018, when extreme rainfall flooded more than half of our state and country, I realized we are in a climate emergency. My parents and other people also began to realize this was the first time they had seen something of that scale. As time went on, I started noticing that other impacts of climate change were visible and it was even impacting our livelihood: streams began to dry out quickly; wettest summer, driest monsoon; high temperatures. And yet, unlike other issues, tackling the climate crisis was a backstage event, and there were no mainstream political or media discussions on such a pressing issue. ADVERTISEMENT Michiel De Smet, 35, Belgium Finance program lead for the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and finance initiative lead for the European Union Platform on Sustainable Finance At high school, I became interested in food and livestock production, initially driven by concern for the treatment of animals. Increasingly, though, the industry’s role in climate change became clear to me, which then sparked further interest in global warming. Around that time I was also keeping bees, which made me aware of pollution and biodiversity issues. It became clear that the many challenges we face today, like climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, are connected. Add social inequality and one realizes we have to change our economic model. Meredith Adler, 32, U.S. and Canada Executive director of Student Energy, a nonprofit that organizes students across the world committed to a sustainable-energy future When I started in university, I considered myself active on issues of poverty alleviation, youth empowerment, human rights and Indigenous rights. I came to recognize that the immediate problems people are facing are caused by larger systems that are inequitable or unsustainable. And so I became obsessed with energy. Our energy system — how we produce, transport and consume energy — is not equitable or sustainable. It is shaped by colonialism and capitalism, and a person’s access to energy or lack thereof determines so many things about their life, from health to education to how much money they can make. Increasing energy access is directly correlated to increasing income across the world. RODRÍGUEZ I’m one of the authors of the climate emergency bill that was passed in the [Argentine] Senate in 2019 which declared the country in a state of climate and ecological emergency. In Youth for Climate Argentina, I also work with social and economically vulnerable groups fighting for climate justice. These social actors play a key role in the industrial transition processes. I’m pushing for a series of climate and ecological proposals which create jobs for their sectors and also elevate their standard of living by climate transition measures. I’m working as well on an adaptation proposal; many of my city’s poor neighborhoods lack the infrastructure to prevent the impacts of floods and other extreme climate events. ADVERTISEMENT NAKATE I started a project called Vash Green Schools. We install solar panels and climate-friendly stoves, and so far have helped 13 schools in rural areas in Uganda. Many of these schools didn’t have electricity before, so they’re not even transitioning, they’re just starting out green. This kind of thing is crucial across the continent of Africa, where electricity demand is set to double by 2030. But funding from foreign governments and banks still flows into fossil fuels instead of clean energy projects, funding things like the East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline, which will destroy wild habitats and local farmland, let alone cause a huge amount of emissions. JOSE Through social media, I began to make people aware of the climate crisis and the human hand behind it. Also, being from the global south, to highlight climate injustice and inequality. I follow three tracks to give me hope and prevent anxiety: first, individual actions or initiatives, from awareness through social media and educational materials to local initiatives like rewilding (protecting natural and wildlife areas) and regenerative permaculture (integrating human activity and environmental protection). Then come collaborative actions with like-minded people. Activism is the final hope to make everyone, including the leaders, know about the urgency to invest in available solutions. DE SMET I’ve become increasingly aware that we cannot fix climate change until we fix the economy. Shifting to renewable energy can address 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, but to achieve U.N. climate goals, it is imperative we tackle the remaining 45 percent. Taking on this global challenge can only be done if we shift from our current take-make-waste system to one that eliminates waste, circulates products and materials, and regenerates nature — a circular economy. To this end, I lead the Ellen MacArthur Foundation work in the financial sector, collaborating with large financial institutions and policymakers to inform and create solutions for scaling financing for a circular economy — one designed to eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials, and regenerate nature. ADLER Student Energy is a movement of 50,000 youths in over 190 countries. We work to empower young people to deploy climate solutions in their communities, both to help prevent the worst impacts and to help communities adapt. We provide the tool kit that accelerates climate-focused young people’s ability to become entrepreneurs, build their careers and influence policymakers. We also work with corporations, governments and organizations on strategies for meaningful youth empowerment. This year, Student Energy launched the Solutions Movement to mobilize $150 million in funding for 10,000 youth-led energy projects this decade. Instead of going after short-term “wins,” we are playing the long game of building the next generation of voters, consumers, employees and entrepreneurs who will address climate change and build clean energy solutions. RODRÍGUEZ There is a strong obstacle to identifying climate change as a socioeconomic issue. Governments are used to dissociating the economic agenda from the climate agenda and this affects the public debate. A good way to address these difficulties is to inform how climate change specifically impacts our daily lives. Heat waves that affect children, the sick and the elderly the most; extreme economic loss and other examples could be useful for finding better ways of climate change communication. ADVERTISEMENT NAKATE I think many people still believe it is something for 2050, or the end of the century. The fact that the media doesn’t report on the climate crisis like it is a crisis fuels that belief.   The impacts in Africa are already severe: droughts and food shortages in Angola and Madagascar, flooding in Uganda, the monsoon shifting in Sierra Leone, even locust swarms, caused by wet conditions, destroying thousands of hectares of crops in East Africa. If the world properly understood the damage that is being caused in the most affected areas, perhaps there would be more urgency for countries to start cutting their emissions now. RODRÍGUEZ Getting to understand the basic causes of climate change gives us the power to choose a different path as consumers; we can shape the economy of the future just by consolidating a collective environmental consciousness. Governments have the obligation to tell the truth about climate change through integral environmental education policies. The private sector is also responsible for this duty. Companies must inform consumers how they produce what they sell, how much they emit and other environmental costs. JOSE Having impact and showing some progress are such individual actions as rooftop solar/micro renewables, rewilding, land/rooftop garden/regenerative agriculture, mobilization. Lack of resources are slowing down the progress in those actions. But even if millions of us act, those efforts amount to only a fraction of the impact that government and corporations could accomplish. ADLER Talk to the people around you about climate change. A crisis of this scale needs to be front-page news and dinner-table conversation — not just when a disaster occurs, but when the solutions are being debated, and when communities come together and take action. Demand better from media when it comes to how they talk about climate change. Work to uplift and empower Indigenous leadership. Indigenous people are the stewards of our lands and research shows they protect 80 percent of our biodiversity. Everyone will face obstacles in taking action, but each person is also uniquely qualified to do something. DE SMET While a shift toward renewable energy sources is happening, we need young people to also understand how we have to transform our production and consumption systems. The circular economy provides a powerful tool for an industrial transformation that can tackle climate change and biodiversity loss while addressing social needs. We urgently need to move from words to actions, and should use that passion and energy to create a resilient and prosperous future for not only today’s generation but those beyond. ADVERTISEMENT RODRÍGUEZ Recognizing that youth leadership is not a matter of the future but a fundamental pillar of the present is a great step toward lasting climate solutions. I believe that all the young activist energy must be channeled not only through the power of the streets but also through decision-making processes. ADLER We need to believe in young people and empower them. Hands-on experience paired with coaching, mentorship and funding will empower them to build the clean energy businesses we need, or develop skills to work with governments and companies to transform our world."
" Air twisted, whirled and howled, hurling debris off brownstone rooftops and shucking trees from sidewalk plots. Cars flipped, people fled. The tornado that struck Brooklyn in August 2007 caused tens of millions of dollars in damage, displaced dozens of residents and sent a warning to New York: The next one could prove catastrophic, especially in a city unaccustomed to such storms. While the chance of a tornado striking New York City remains extremely small, the 2007 storm proved that it is not out of the question. On Saturday, as heavy rain, quarter-size hail and powerful wind battered the region, seven tornadoes skirted perilously close to the city, with four touching down on Long Island and three in Connecticut, the National Weather Service said. The next time a tornado hits the city, the consequences could be devastating, according to interviews with more than 30 experts, including meteorologists, engineers and government officials. ADVERTISEMENT “Rare events by definition happen,” said Dr. Harold Brooks, a senior research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “How you prioritize that kind of weather event, though, is a pretty hard policy question to answer.” Of the roughly 1,200 tornadoes that form in the United States every year, only a tiny number threaten cities. There is about a 1 in 2,000 chance that a tornado will strike a particular building in Oklahoma City in any given year, said Paul Markowski, a professor of meteorology at Penn State University, citing data from the National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center. The odds of a tornado striking a particular target in New York City, he said, are lower: about 1 in 5,000. But tornadoes appear in every state, killing about 80 people a year nationwide, and the danger to cities should not be dismissed, experts said. “The atmosphere is agnostic about where the right conditions will come together,” Dr. Markowski said. “If you have Oklahoma or Alabama tornado conditions developing in New York, you’ll get an Oklahoma or Alabama tornado event in New York.” ADVERTISEMENT Scientists have not yet determined whether a link exists between climate change and the frequency or strength of tornadoes, which are relatively small, short-lived storms. There is also limited data available. But climate change is most likely increasing the number of days in which conditions are ripe for thunderstorms, which can spawn tornadoes, said Michael Tippett, a professor of applied mathematics at Columbia University. Based on current climate models, the New York region could have about six more days a year of thunderstorm weather by 2100, said John Allen, a climate scientist at Central Michigan University. “I wouldn’t say that New York is exceptionally vulnerable,” he said. “But that’s what makes it challenging in some respects, right? The rare event is the one that could have a considerable impact that people don’t necessarily anticipate or prepare for.” The National Risk Index, an analysis created by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, ranked New York City at higher risk for tornadoes than states like Oklahoma and Kansas because the potential for damage was much higher. “You see someplace that’s so densely populated with infrastructure, with buildings, with people — when an event such as this happens, there’s a consequence,” said Michael Grimm, assistant administrator for risk management at FEMA. On Sept. 1, as the remnants of Hurricane Ida unleashed deadly downpours across the boroughs and threatened a tornado, officials warned residents in the Bronx and Manhattan to “take shelter NOW.” ADVERTISEMENT But it is not clear how many New Yorkers have appropriate shelter, nor how many know what to do if a tornado strikes. A series of national surveys, done yearly from 2017 to 2021, asked 516 New York City residents how much time they believed they would have to reach safety after a tornado warning was issued. About 75 percent of them said they would have more than one hour. In reality, it’s about 15 minutes. “You can imagine how dangerous that would be if people are thinking: ‘Well, the tornado warning came. I better hop in a cab and get home,’” said Dr. Joseph Ripberger, associate director of the National Institute for Risk and Resilience and an author of a study on the surveys. (Experts say cars are particularly dangerous during tornadoes.) Some experts said that while the city had more urgent, climate-change-driven problems to address — namely hurricanes and flooding — more tornado education was needed. “I work in disaster response, and I wouldn’t know what to do if there was a tornado,” said Amy Chester, managing director of Rebuild by Design, a nonprofit that works on infrastructure. “New York is utterly unprepared for tornadoes, and we saw what happened when we were unprepared for the flash floods,” Ms. Chester said. Heather Roiter, assistant commissioner of New York City’s office of emergency management, said the city was “always trying to get the message out about how to be prepared for emergencies, including tornadoes.” She said the city was trying to focus “at the community level,” noting an event her office hosted in July in partnership with Oklahoma City’s emergency management agency. ADVERTISEMENT Officials in Alabama, Texas and Oklahoma — states where tornadoes are more common — said that drills in which students walk to an enclosed area, away from windows, helped ensure that warnings were taken seriously even outside school. Experts said this practice would be useful in New York, which mandates drills for fires and other emergencies but not for tornadoes. History shows some of the horror tornadoes can inflict on cities. In 1896, one killed 138 people in St. Louis. In 1925, a tornado killed nearly 700 people across three states, injuring 2,000 others and obliterating 15,000 homes. In 2020, several tornadoes shredded East Nashville, killing 25 in Tennessee. What makes New York City especially vulnerable to a tornado, experts said, is its large population — largely unfamiliar with tornado safety — and its architecture, with many older buildings and an abundance of potential debris. In Manhattan, a powerful tornado could cause billions of dollars in damage. In other boroughs, neighborhoods could be smashed and utilities seriously damaged. “This summer was really a big wake-up call for this area, that we’re not immune to the effects of severe thunderstorms, and the perils that they bring, which includes tornadoes,” said Megan Linkin, a meteorologist and senior underwriter at Swiss Re Corporate Solutions, an insurance company. “You would have an extreme amount of flying debris, and the debris causes extraordinary, life-threatening damage,” said Illya Azaroff, an architecture professor at the New York City College of Technology. Wind could make older buildings look “like a dog’s chew toy,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT Buildings with flat roofs could be severely damaged, especially if cladding was unable to withstand wind suction, said Abi Aghayere, a professor of structural engineering at Drexel University. Newer buildings and skyscrapers would most likely withstand wind, but projectiles could crack the glass exteriors of many buildings. “No matter what building you’re at, you need to get away from the windows and get to an interior space,” said Anne Cope, chief engineer at the Insurance Institute for Business and Homes Safety. If a tornado hits the city, experts said that residents should listen to warnings and immediately find shelter away from windows. Do not delay, go outside or watch as rain clouds darken the sky. By the time the wind sounds like an oncoming train, they said, it will probably be too late to flee."
" WASHINGTON — President Biden announced on Monday that his administration was moving to block new federal oil and gas leasing within a 10-mile radius around Chaco Canyon in New Mexico, one of the nation’s oldest and most culturally significant Native American sites. The move, announced at a tribal nations summit meeting at the White House, dovetails two of Mr. Biden’s top policy priorities: working to limit climate change and addressing injustices against Native Americans. It also generated significant pushback from Republicans and from New Mexico’s oil and gas industry. As Mr. Biden pushes his ambitious climate agenda, he has sought to highlight both the role of Native Americans in protecting the nation’s landscape, and the disproportionate impact of climate change on tribal populations. “No group of Americans has created and cared more about preserving what we inherited than the tribal nations,” he said on Monday. “We have to continue to stand up for the dignity of sovereignty of tribal nations.” ADVERTISEMENT At the White House meeting with tribal leaders on Monday, Mr. Biden also signed an executive order directing four federal agencies to create a strategy to improve public safety and justice for Native Americans and to address the epidemic of missing or murdered Indigenous people. But the president has come under fierce criticism recently from Native American environmentalists. Last month, dozens of Indigenous and environmental activists protested in front of the White House for days, calling on Mr. Biden to do more to combat fossil fuel use. Dozens of them were arrested at a sit-in at the Interior Department. The demonstrators were protesting the administration’s approval of Line 3, a $9 billion pipeline that would carry hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil through Minnesota’s delicate watersheds and tribal lands. They also called on the Interior Department to close the Bureau of Indian Affairs and restore millions of acres of land seized from Native Americans. The administration’s move to protect Chaco Canyon and the area around it, known as Chaco Culture National Historical Park, came after years of tribal requests. ADVERTISEMENT It followed Mr. Biden’s decision in October to restore and expand protections to Bears Ears National Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante, national monuments in Utah that are sacred to Native Americans and that had been opened to mining and drilling by the Trump administration. The Chaco Canyon park, an area of roughly 30,000 acres in the high desert mesas of northwest New Mexico, was established in 1907 by President Theodore Roosevelt. A UNESCO World Heritage site, it is home to a vast network of pre-Columbian ruins. Between the ninth and 13th centuries, the area was home to a large, complex society of Pueblo culture, with multiple settlements of multistory houses and sacred sites. But for the past decade, Pueblo and other Native groups have expressed concerns that oil and gas development was encroaching on the borders of the park. While Congress has enacted some short-term drilling bans around the park, there has been no long-term or permanent policy to block drilling at its edges. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American cabinet secretary, will enact the new plan to protect the area. Ms. Haaland, a former environmental activist, is a citizen of the Laguna Pueblo, a sovereign nation near Albuquerque. “Chaco Canyon is a sacred place that holds deep meaning for the Indigenous peoples whose ancestors lived, worked and thrived in that high desert community,” Ms. Haaland said. “Now is the time to consider more enduring protections for the living landscape that is Chaco, so that we can pass on this rich cultural legacy to future generations. I value and appreciate the many tribal leaders, elected officials and stakeholders who have persisted in their work to conserve this special area.” Some Native people said they remained skeptical of the administration’s efforts to protect their lands. “There have been a lot of promising announcements but so far not a lot of tangible results,” said Heather Tanana, an assistant professor at the University of Utah College of Law, who is Navajo. Of the move to protect the Chaco Canyon region, Ms. Tanana said: “In theory, it sounds good. But oil and gas development has been going on in that area since the 50s, and a lot of harm has already happened. What will happen to remedy those harms?” ADVERTISEMENT The administration has recently proposed tough new regulations on oil and gas producers, and industry representatives immediately raised questions about the new move. “There doesn’t appear to be a scientific or environmental rationale for that 10-mile radius,” said Robert McEntyre, a spokesman for the New Mexico Oil & Gas Association. “And given the role that oil and gas plays in the economy of that area, we shouldn’t have an arbitrary number that would limit economic opportunities, perhaps the only economic opportunities, in that part of the state.” “No one is saying that we want to develop inside the park or that we need to be directly inside its boundaries,” Mr. McEntyre added. “But the 10-mile number appears to be arbitrary. Especially over such a long period that could have generational consequences.” Representative Bruce Westerman of Arkansas, the ranking Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee, said, “Shutting down safe, reliable pipelines, eliminating thousands of technical jobs and thwarting energy development at every turn is apparently not enough for President Biden and his administration, as now they are continuing their war on American energy by banning all new oil and gas leases near Chaco Canyon.” In the coming weeks, administration officials said, the Bureau of Land Management, which is part of the Interior Department, will publish a notice in the Federal Register that will initiate the process of banning new oil and gas leases on federal land in the 10-mile radius around Chaco Culture National Historical Park for a period of 20 years. One that notice is published, there will be an initial two-year moratorium on issuing new oil and gas drilling leases in the federal land in the 10-mile radius while the proposal is subject to a public comment period, environmental analysis and formal tribal consultation. The ban would not affect existing valid leases or rights and would not apply to oil, gas or other minerals owned by private, state or tribal entities. "
" This article is part of a special report on Climate Solutions, which looks at efforts around the world to make a difference. There was a time, including when Martin Henn’s grandfather and father were at the peak of their careers, when many architects lived by a simple creed: bigger was better. But with a growing awareness of how that thinking contributes to the greenhouse gas emissions that are linked to climate change, a new vocabulary has sprouted in many firms: sustainability, circular economy, organic design. That is the kind of language that Martin Henn, 41, said he brought into the German architecture firm HENN that his grandfather, Walter Henn, founded in Dresden in 1947 and that his father, Gunter, joined in 1979 and later expanded into Munich. It is in line with a growing awareness among architects about the need to design in ways that help, rather than hurt, the environment. Switching building practices has enormous potential to reduce CO2 emissions. Construction and operations generate nearly 40 percent of the CO2 emitted globally each year, with materials and construction alone accounting for 11 percent of emissions, according to Architecture 2030, a think tank based in Santa Fe, N.M. Just three popular materials — concrete, steel and aluminum — contribute 23 percent of all emissions. Mr. Henn, a managing director of HENN, joined the family firm in 2008 after working at Zaha Hadid Architects in London and Asymptote Architecture in New York. He now oversees the design of all of HENN’s projects. He said he has approached his role with the intention of making a positive impact on the environment with every building his company conceives. ADVERTISEMENT “Architecture is a powerful tool that can actually help mitigate climate change,” he said. “The opposite tends to be the general perception, but definitely doesn’t have to be the case.” HENN has more than 350 employees and has worked on the Merck Innovation Center in Darmstadt, Germany; the Volkswagen Transparent Factory in Dresden; and a Hyundai Design Center in Seoul, among others. The firm has been involved with more than 70 buildings, including Westlake University in Hangzhou, China, and the renovation of the Gasteig, a cultural center in Munich. Below are excerpts from a recent interview with Mr. Henn, who spoke to The New York Times from Berlin, where he is based. This interview has been edited and condensed. HENN is a long-established architecture firm. How did its priorities change when you joined? I come from a younger generation that understands the urgency of our climate crisis. Limiting the environmental impact of our work and making a positive impact became a priority. I also brought a new design vocabulary to the firm. Can you explain how sustainability factors into the structures you design? The most sustainable building is one that uses the least amount of building materials and operational energy, is made from materials with the lowest carbon footprint and has the longest life span. HENN considers all three factors in every design. ADVERTISEMENT We believe in less demolition and more repurposing or renovation. Around one-third of our projects are renovations. New construction, when necessary, should anticipate the future with designs that are easy to reuse or disassemble. Our buildings also use local and recycled materials; more timber and less concrete because timber is one of the most sustainable building materials in the world; and facades that let the building breathe like an organism, which keeps them cool in the summer and warm in the winter without the use of air-conditioning or heaters. Can you tell us how two of your most recent projects considered the environment? We recently overhauled the HVB Tower in Munich, which was built in 1981. The goal was to preserve the exterior while transforming it into an energy-efficient building. We removed, cleaned, perforated and reinstalled the original facade panels to create a double-layered skin. The windows of the new inner layer can be opened for fresh air. This is unusual in tall buildings, but it reduces cooling costs and is better for the environment and healthier for the occupant. The renovated building achieved LEED Platinum certification. Another example is the Brunner Innovation Factory, in Rheinau, for the furniture company Brunner. Inspired by the construction details and natural materials of their products, we designed a lightweight, minimal structure made from sustainable timber that is designed to be easily disassembled and reused. ADVERTISEMENT Please talk about how some of your upcoming projects are sustainable. We are undertaking an ambitious modernization of the Gasteig, a cultural center in Munich that opened in 1985. Our proposal reuses as much of the original structure as possible — a radical idea in the context of today’s culture of disposability. We are removing and reusing bricks as a form of CO2 storage; using solar panels for energy and the nearby river for passive heating and cooling strategies; and using the roof as an urban farm whose produce will be used in Gasteig’s restaurant. HENN is also working on expanding the University Hospital in Aachen [Germany]. We’re leaving the original building and the landscape visually untouched since our extension happens almost entirely underground. The ICU, operating rooms and common spaces are organized around a series of light wells and sunken gardens that provide plentiful sunlight, natural ventilation and access to green spaces within the hospital. As you’ve designed buildings and helped see them realized, can you share what challenges you’ve encountered when it comes to sustainability? The imperative of faster-better-stronger still applies to the construction industry, which can mean defaulting to fast, familiar and cheap solutions. But building sustainably doesn’t mean a more expensive building, especially when you consider the lifetime costs, not just the construction costs. ADVERTISEMENT Things that seem more expensive upfront will cost less in the long term: a double-layer facade, instead of a single layer, will decrease heating and cooling costs; the use of high-quality materials will prevent the need for repair and replacement; structural systems designed for disassembly can be reused again and again; and even LED lights last longer than regular lights. What social responsibility do architects have to be more sustainable? As architects, we have an urgent personal and professional responsibility to address building-related CO2 emissions. The most important thing we can communicate is that sustainability isn’t an afterthought or an add-on, it’s not just solar panels on a roof — it’s fundamental to the form-finding, the materials we use and the performance of a building and its components. How can architects influence developers to use sustainable building materials to construct their structures? Is it their responsibility to do so? One way to approach this is through the developer’s bottom line. Besides the long-term cost-saving benefits of adaptable buildings, circular construction and sustainable building materials, we can save time and money through modular and prefab [prefabricated] construction. Developers are already interested in sustainability, it’s a much easier conversation to have now than it was 10 years ago. The next step is to move beyond the certification checklist, which comes at the end of the project, to identify how sustainability can motivate a project and be integrated from day one. What are some construction materials that make structures more sustainable? It’s best to use local materials that don’t need to be transported long distances and natural materials like wood, which is carbon-sequestering and renewable when harvested sustainably; surfaces made from clay or ceramics, a readily available material that has a natural pollutant binding effect and regulates interior humidity; and natural stone cladding which can be produced using zero-waste methods."
" This article is part of a special report on Climate Solutions, which looks at efforts around the world to make a difference. Bibba Thompson and the 75 older adults who live around her in a local government housing community in northern England do not look like revolutionaries. But they are cheerfully taking part in a home energy trial that is billed by organizers as part of a new “green industrial revolution,” one they hope will put their little community at the forefront of global energy changes for the second time in three centuries. Since August, Ms. Thompson, 58, and her neighbors in the hilltop village of Winlaton, outside Newcastle, have had their gas heaters and stoves fueled by a blend that includes up to 20 percent hydrogen. The reason? To reduce the climate-warming gases, like carbon dioxide, that are emitted by their appliances. ADVERTISEMENT As the host of the United Nations climate talks in Glasgow, the British government has committed to one of the world’s most ambitious emission reduction targets, pledging to slash greenhouse gases by 78 percent by 2035. Home heating is one of the areas where it has to match its promises with action. Trials in Australia and elsewhere have experimented with lower levels of hydrogen in the fuel blend, and the Netherlands allows blends of up to 12 percent, but the gas network operators organizing the 670-home Winlaton trial say this is the first time  a 20 percent hydrogen blend has been put into an existing gas grid with normal gas appliances. The firms argue that it is an important step toward reducing Britain’s greenhouse gas emissions, and they hope it will encourage the eventual use of 100 percent hydrogen in the home heaters that the government says account for about 14 percent of the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions. With the government concentrating on supporting the use of hydrogen for industrial customers rather than home heating, the gas companies are desperate for their huge pipe networks to retain a central role in the nation’s heating, and part of their strategy is to convince the public that switching to hydrogen would be clean, easy, cheap and safe. “A few people were dubious at first about ‘Is my boiler going to blow up?’ but it has all gone well and they are quite chuffed with it now,” said Ms. Thompson, who lives on site and manages the 55-unit complex for people over 65.“The older ones think that cleaning up the environment is great for their grandkids, and it really strikes a chord here because of our history,” she said. “We might be just a little village but we have got a big coal heritage.” ADVERTISEMENT Winlaton did indeed play a big role in the era that first unleashed fossil fuels on a mass scale. A few hundred meters from Ms. Thompson’s housing project, just behind the library on Church Street, sits a 330-year-old forge, the last remnant of an operation that made Winlaton a crucial site in the Industrial Revolution. The forge was part of an enterprise set up in 1691 by Ambrose Crowley that became the largest iron works in Europe, with hundreds of workers churning out nails and chains for the Royal Navy and other iron goods, including slave manacles for British colonies. That was years before the invention of the steam engine and other machines that are generally held to mark the start of the Industrial Revolution. Val Scully, a trustee of the local heritage center, said that Mr. Crowley’s key contribution was to pioneer mass production techniques and the creation of an industrial working class, who toiled side by side on weekly salaries. It was that system that allowed the inventions of the next decades to flourish and unleash the genie of coal power, a genie that much of the world is now desperately trying to put back in its bottle. Tim Harwood, the head of hydrogen projects at Northern Gas Networks, a pipeline operator, said northeast England has  a chance to be the home of “the next industrial revolution, a green one.” The region is already an important focus of offshore wind energy and the government sees the industrial clusters around Newcastle and Hull as centers of what it hopes will be a conversion to clean-burning hydrogen. ADVERTISEMENT Hydrogen’s lower calorific value means that rolling out a 20 percent blend to all natural gas customers would reduce their emissions from heating by 7 percent, trimming about 1 percent from total emissions in Britain. The big payoff would come with a switch to pure hydrogen, which could slice more than a tenth off the nation’s emissions. But it would also require the installation of millions of new appliances — an enormous challenge. Mr. Harwood said blending is “just a steppingstone and a way of stimulating the switch over to hydrogen.” Many analysts and some government ministers doubt that the nation will be able to produce enough hydrogen in the foreseeable future to roll it out beyond heavy industries. The challenges include getting the costs of production down quickly enough to reduce the subsidies needed to make hydrogen price-competitive and moving as quickly as possible from “blue hydrogen,” which is made with methane and requires the capture and underground storage of its own carbon emissions, to the cleaner “green hydrogen,” which needs more electricity to produce but has no carbon emissions. The gas operators are trying to speed things up, and are keen not to be bypassed in the government’s drive to install the potentially cleaner electric heat pumps that are already popular in continental Europe. ADVERTISEMENT “If you think about the 23 million customers in the U.K. that have a gas supply, we’re hoping to penetrate up to 16 million customers with hydrogen,” Mr. Harwood said. “You couldn’t put a heat pump in most Winlaton homes,” he said, “because the housing stock is old, leaky and cold, and heat pumps don’t produce enough heat without special insulation.” Current programs to upgrade the gas network by replacing metal pipes with hydrogen-ready plastic should be finished by the time enough hydrogen is being produced to consider switching heating to pure hydrogen, Mr. Harwood said, and the gas companies want the government to mandate as soon as possible that all new gas boilers must be capable of being converted to hydrogen. The government has already announced plans for a “hydrogen village” trial in which about 2,000 properties will run on pure hydrogen from 2025, to be followed by a “hydrogen town” of up to 15,000 properties by 2030, but Mr. Harwood said the gas operators would prefer to see that schedule sped up. Dave Tully, a 63-year-old former military policeman who lives in a two-bedroom terrace house in Winlaton, said he received leaflets about the 10-month trial and a free safety inspection of his appliances but he still felt “railroaded” into taking part. “I think it was going to go ahead no matter what the public thought, but in the end that’s probably fair enough,” he said. “It turns out it hasn’t changed the way our cooker or heater work at all and I suppose we have to do something about climate change, so this sort of thing is probably necessary.” ADVERTISEMENT The hydrogen campaign in Winlaton has included invitations to two display homes, where locals can see that the 100 percent hydrogen stoves and heaters are the same size as existing gas appliances. The only noticeable difference is that the flame from the  burners is orange rather than blue and has a broader “sunflower” shape to distribute the heat more widely, as hydrogen is lighter and its heat tends to rise more quickly. Mr. Harwood said he hoped to see those new flames heating British cups of tea within a decade."
" This article is part of a special report on Climate Solutions, which looks at efforts around the world to make a difference. When the fisherman leveled his spear gun and fired at her across the dark water, Evelyn Malicay held her ground in her kayak, gripping a stone to defend herself. This was her backyard, the marine sanctuary she had helped create and felt a duty to protect. The spear missed. Ms. Malicay’s efforts to catch yet another late-night poacher did not. “What they do not know,” she said, recalling that night several years ago when she called the police on the man, “is that I am always on watch.” Ms. Malicay, 53, a compact, vibrant Filipina mother who years ago lost her village council seat over her support for the Maite Marine Sanctuary, has since apprehended neighbors and relatives fishing inside it, recruited dozens of community members to back her and won numerous awards for her championship of marine conservation. ADVERTISEMENT The sanctuary, just steps away from her home, is one of the most successful of the 22 marine protected areas on the island of Siquijor in the south-central Philippines, at the heart of the species-rich Coral Triangle. This no-fishing zone shares one uncommon asset with a variety of other unusually successful conservation projects around the globe: It’s run by women. Globally, commitments to conservation have been marked by failure. Last year, just as the World Economic Forum identified the accelerating loss of biodiversity as one of the most critical threats to the global economy — threatening “the collapse of food and health systems” and “the disruption of entire supply chains,” according to their annual Global Risk Report — the United Nations issued a damning summary of progress toward the Convention on Biological Diversity’s 2020 targets, which were agreed upon a decade ago by nearly every nation. “Humanity stands at a crossroads,” the U.N. report read. More than 190 nations had collectively missed every target. As those reports were being published, Robyn James, a Nature Conservancy gender and equity adviser based in Australia, was concluding a review of her own, looking at hundreds of studies from around the world to consider whether engaging women in conservation and natural resource management increases the impact of those projects. The environmental sector has been slower to address gender inequity than other sectors, like development and business, Ms. James co-wrote in Oryx — The International Journal of Conservation. The six-author study showed that in countries from Nepal to Cameroon, Australia to Canada, women are excluded from roles in conservation and natural resource management. But in landscapes and organizations where they are meaningfully included, environmental outcomes improve. ADVERTISEMENT Case studies they considered show that when women lead in conservation, indicators of success like solidarity, rule compliance and forest and fishery regeneration often go up, even as these women face doubt, discrimination and even threats of violence. In the early days of the Maite Marine Sanctuary, which was created in 2009 to prevent harvest in the coral reef and sea grass habitats within its boundaries, Ms. Malicay used her position as an elected village council member to maintain strict enforcement of the sanctuary, knowing that by doing so, she was helping to preserve food and financial security for future generations. But, said Reaan Catitig, who coordinates the Coastal Conservation and Education Foundation’s technical support for Siquijor’s marine sanctuaries, the sanctuary then did not yet have broad support. Men were afraid to give up their fishing grounds, he said, and angry to be forced beyond its edges. Many members of the village community “became her enemy,” Mr. Catitig said, and she was never elected to the council again. Whenever she goes out to patrol, Ms. Malicay said, “I always carry a stone.” In Australia, Ms. James said that she, too, has experienced discrimination throughout her career, which she began as a wildlife ranger in a remote region of Australia. Tagging kangaroos and surveying crocodiles, she was often the only woman, she said. Globally, in 2019, according to the World Wildlife Fund, only an estimated 7.5 percent of rangers were women. “I experienced all sorts of sexual harassment, exclusion and people thinking I couldn’t do it,” Ms. James said. Later in her career, she was discouraged from applying for leadership positions because of the risks of working at remote field sites, or the logistical complications posed by being a mother. ADVERTISEMENT Both women’s experiences fit a growing body of research demonstrating all the ways women in conservation are restricted by cultural norms and gendered stereotypes that vary by location — but exist everywhere in some form. In 2019, for example, conservation researchers in Colorado documented evidence showing that in the United States, women in conservation are often excluded from decision-making, overlooked in hiring, relegated to administrative tasks or assumed to be inadequate or wrong. In a Solomon Islands community Ms. James has worked with, women in the field also risk physical violence. She said one strong female conservation leader there was accused of sorcery — an allegation that has led to the assault and murder of scores of accused women and men across the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea, according to regional news reports. “Whenever you challenge power, that can come with risk,” Ms. James said. “It is risky for these women, but we have to keep supporting them.” Partly, she said, that is justified by a simple human rights argument for gender equality. But there’s a conservation argument, too: In the most biodiverse places on Earth, men and women experience and interact with nature very differently. For example, in many coastal communities, men go to the sea to fish, while women collect shellfish along the shore. As a result, women have different needs from conservation — and see different opportunities for solutions. ADVERTISEMENT In Siquijor, islanders are, as in most of the Philippines, heavily dependent on the ocean for both income and food. But these days, fishermen here are catching less and less. Oceana, an ocean conservation nonprofit, reports that across the Philippines 75 percent of fishing grounds are overfished, and reef fish have declined by up to 90 percent. As fish stocks have continued to decline as a result of both overfishing and climate change, research at nearby Silliman University shows that fishermen have only tried harder, resorting to ever more illegal and destructive methods: three-layered trammel nets, chlorine poison, dynamite. The resulting ecosystem death spiral is straight out of “Fisheries 101,” said Aileen Maypa, a biologist who spent years working to restore reefs in Siquijor and neighboring islands. “If you don’t do anything,” she said, “everything is famine.” Dr. Maypa said women’s involvement has repeatedly transformed outcomes in the region. Men “are looking at the now,” she said. “Women are looking at the future.” When women are involved, she said, arguments are less bloody and poaching is less common, and when new conservation projects are proposed, women almost always say yes — and are more willing to accept near-term compromises, and then work to expand projects. “The approach of women is softer,” she said, adding: “That doesn’t mean it’s less strong.” The Philippines is home to more than 1,200 marine protected areas, but most marine scientists believe few achieve meaningful conservation goals. In Siquijor, the most recent local assessments, completed in 2019, show at least half the island’s 22 sanctuaries meet criteria for “excellent” management. Of those, two are run almost entirely by women. ADVERTISEMENT On the far northern end of the island, at the mangrove-banked Binoongan Marine Sanctuary, local conservation leaders say that 16 women did what men could not — or would not — do: They volunteered to manage the sanctuary in collaboration with the village council after the village’s male-dominated fishing organization refused. Without their efforts, many say, the sanctuary would have remained in perpetual decline. Instead, reports show it now features the highest fish biomass of any sanctuary in Siquijor, and in 2019 was named by the island’s alliance of coastal resource managers as both the best marine protected area on the island and the one with the most community support. On the other side of the island, the Maite Marine Sanctuary was named most enterprising and livelihood generating. Under Ms. Malicay’s leadership, about 35 women — some well into their 80s — and 15 men maintain boundary buoys, remove trash and invasive starfish and collect user fees from snorkeling and diving tourists. They also rotate to staff a catering kitchen and bakery, which offer a small but meaningful income to active members and helps sustain families with an alternative — or supplement — to fishing. Every night, at least one of them stands watch for poachers. Since the sanctuary’s inception, they have seen parrotfish, goatfish and grouper return to these waters. Officially, the sanctuary is just over six hectares but every time a fisherman cuts their buoy line, Ms. Malicay said, they inch it little bit farther out to sea. From her kayak on a quiet evening in 2019, she pulled a fine mesh of seaweed from that same boundary line, freeing a white Styrofoam buoy. Nearby, a dark, living thing nudged the surface. A sea turtle, she said. Or maybe a fish. Then, singing softly to herself, she kept paddling."
" WASHINGTON — President Biden and President Xi Jinping of China met in a virtual summit on Monday evening as the United States seeks to engage in what the administration calls “intense competition” with China while preventing serious conflict. The meeting, which began shortly before 8 p.m. Eastern, was expected to last more than three hours. Since becoming president, Mr. Biden had previously spoken twice with Mr. Xi, but they have not met in person this year. Administration officials said the virtual meeting was meant to reassure both sides that misunderstandings and miscommunications would not lead to unintended clashes. A senior U.S. official told reporters on Sunday that the president would emphasize the need to keep “communication lines open” as the two countries confront disagreements over issues like the future of Taiwan, the militarization of the South China Sea and cybersecurity. Mr. Biden has repeatedly suggested that it should be possible to avoid active military engagement with China, even as the United States engages in competition with Beijing and continues to confront the Chinese leadership on several significant issues. ADVERTISEMENT But the call, which was initiated at Mr. Biden’s request, reflected his administration’s deep concern that the chances of keeping conflict at bay might be diminishing. Members of Mr. Biden’s team were guarded about what topics he intended to raise with Mr. Xi. The senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the meeting, broadly outlined a few of the issues that were likely to come up. The official said Mr. Biden planned to address several points of disagreement, including China’s human rights abuses, America’s commitment to defending Taiwan, China’s support of its state-based industries and its policies regarding cybertechnologies. Also on the agenda were areas in which Chinese and American interests appeared to be aligned, including efforts to combat global warming. But the administration official said Mr. Biden would make clear to Mr. Xi that working to prevent climate change was not a “favor” to the United States, but rather a decision by China to act in its own best interests. It was unclear whether Mr. Xi intended to raise other issues, such as U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods or the recent U.S. deal to provide nuclear submarines to Australia. The senior official said Mr. Biden was not planning to raise those topics unless Mr. Xi mentioned them. ADVERTISEMENT The official declined to say whether the two leaders would discuss the possibility of U.S. representation at the 2022 Winter Olympics, which will be held in Beijing in February. Biden administration officials have said they believe the U.S.-China relationship is in a new phase that is more dynamic and complex than it has been in years past. But it remains unclear how Mr. Biden will try to accomplish his goals when previous administrations tried and failed to make good on similar agendas. President Barack Obama tried a similar balancing act with the Chinese, securing a commitment from Mr. Xi to avoid militarizing the South China Sea — a threat to international travel through the area — and to reduce cyberconflicts between the two countries. Since then, China has built up its military presence in the South China Sea, and cyberclashes have intensified."
" This article is part of our series on the Future of Transportation, which is exploring innovations and challenges that affect how we move about the world. A fully fueled Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner can fly roughly 8,000 miles while ferrying 300 or so passengers and their luggage. A battery with the energy equivalent to that fuel would weigh about 6.6 million pounds. That’s why — despite environmental advantages — we don’t have battery-powered electric airliners. But aviation companies working to make cleaner aircraft are exploring the use of hydrogen, the world’s most abundant element, to power both electric and combustion engines — and to make air travel more eco-friendly Hydrogen-powered planes are already aloft, although mostly as small, experimental aircraft. Yet those planes are helping to pave the way for net-zero carbon aviation by 2050, the goal set by many government and environmental groups. But hydrogen isn’t without controversy: For now, it’s expensive, not always green, and some say dangerous. “There are three ways of using hydrogen as fuel onboard an aircraft,” said Amanda Simpson, who leads green initiatives for the aircraft manufacturer Airbus. Hydrogen can be a source of power for batterylike fuel cells, in hybrid aircraft, or as combustible fuel. ADVERTISEMENT Alternative-fuel technologies are well established in the automotive world, of course. Cars that burn alternative fuels — remember diesels converted to burn used French-fry oil? — have been around since the earliest days of horseless carriages. And hybrid gas and electric cars, such as the Toyota Prius, have been available since 1997. But only a few models, including the Toyota Mirai and the Hyundai Nexo, use hydrogen fuel cells. When Val Miftakhov founded ZeroAvia to develop electric aircraft, he first considered battery power. A Siberian émigré and physicist, his earlier start-up converted gasoline cars to electric, then incorporated an improved charging system. But batteries can sustain only the shortest excursions, like training flights. “Where a mission is an hour, batteries might work,” he said. Battery-powered trainers also exist, such as the Pipistrel Alfa Electro which claims a one-hour flight time. ZeroAvia instead chose fuel cells, which are essentially a chemical battery that substitutes lighter-than-air hydrogen for the weighty lithium ion. Hydrogen is notable for its energy density — the amount of energy per kilogram — which is about three times that of jet fuel. The byproduct of burning hydrogen is water. Hydrogen can be made from water and renewable energy, although most is now made from natural gas, which is not particularly green.  Mr. Miftakhov acknowledged that hydrogen storage containers, which were generally designed for ground transportation, were not practical for aircraft. “We need to focus on reducing the weight,” he said, “We have some fairly low-hanging fruit.” Unlike electric batteries, hydrogen fuel cells can be recharged in minutes, but there is a lack of fueling stations, and building them would be a huge undertaking. ADVERTISEMENT That problem is less critical for hybrid aircraft, which use a combination of electric and combustion power, said Pat Anderson, a professor of Aerospace Engineering at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. “It can pull up to a fuel pump that exists today and fill up,” he said. Mr. Anderson’s students used a hybrid system in a 2011 eco-flight competition. They didn’t win, but it sold Mr. Anderson on the merits of hybrid power engines, which he now builds at VerdeGo Aero, a Florida company that counts Erik Lindbergh, an X-Prize Foundation board member and Charles Lindbergh’s grandson, as executive chairman. Modern hybrid systems can use a variable mix of electric and combustion power, and can even use the combustion motor as an electric generator in flight. It may give planes more range than battery or fuel cells alone, Mr. Anderson said. Whatever the power source, there are some advantages specific to electric engines, said Roei Ganzarski, who leads two companies: MagniX, which makes electric propulsion systems for aircraft, and Eviation which is developing the futuristic-looking Alice electric aircraft. One advantage is cost. “Airplanes today are really, really expensive, and the main reason is the engines,” he said. They require a lot of maintenance and consume a lot of expensive fuel. “I can reduce the operating cost of that plane around 40 to 50 percent on average,” he claimed. That’s because electric motors are comparatively maintenance free. Harbour Air, which bills itself as “the world’s largest seaplane airline,” is seeking permission to carry passengers on its MagniX electric-powered de Havilland dhc-2 Beaver. A 10-passenger Cessna Grand has also flown with a MagniX engine. ADVERTISEMENT There are some things electric power cannot achieve, like lifting that 787. But that doesn’t mean big jets can’t go green, or at least greener. Several fuel refiners and airlines are experimenting with Sustainable Aviation Fuels, known as SAFs. These fuels, which burn just like the common “Jet A” fuel, can be made from waste such as used cooking fats. Some companies, like Neste, use hydrogen in refining its SAF fuel. Although aviation safety organizations allow commercial aircraft to use fuel containing 50 percent or less SAF, in demonstrations, existing jets have burned 100-percent SAF, “and the engines are very happy with it,” Ms. Simpson of Airbus said. But SAF may be seen as a stopgap, as larger planes have flown happily burning emissions-free pure hydrogen. In 1957, a Martin B-57B powered part of a flight using hydrogen as fuel. In 1988, a Soviet TU-155 airliner flew on hydrogen fuel alone. For Senator Spark Matsunaga, a Democrat of Hawaii who died in 1990, it was a missed opportunity — as significant as Soviet’s Sputnik satellite beating the United States into space. “Once again we’ve missed the boat,” he said, “and we can only hope that the next administration will be more interested in hydrogen than this one has been.” Any mention of hydrogen aircraft means addressing the zeppelin in the room. Although hydrogen has been used in ballooning since 1783, its aeronautical future dimmed on May 6, 1937, when the zeppelin Hindenburg very publicly burned in Lakehurst, N.J. killing 36. It is still debated if the flames, immortalized on radio and in newsreels (and a Led Zeppelin album cover), were caused mostly by hydrogen or the incendiary paint used on the airship’s fabric skin. Regardless, the damage to hydrogen’s reputation lingers today. More recently, ZeroAvia experienced a bad news/good news scenario when its hydrogen-fuel-cell-powered Piper Malibu Mirage M350 crash landed last April. The good news was that no one was hurt, despite the plane losing a wing. Better still, with no fuel to leak and no hot engine to ignite it, there was no Hindenburg-like conflagration. “The hydrogen system itself all held up perfectly,” Mr. Miftakhov said. “The emergency crew said if it were a fossil-fuel plane it would have been a major fire.” ADVERTISEMENT But the big argument against hydrogen has not been safety but cost. Although “green” hydrogen can be produced with water and renewable energy, most produced now is so-called “gray hydrogen” made using fossil fuels, which is not much cleaner than burning those fuels themselves. Hydrogen proponents say that technological improvements and larger scale facilities could bring the cost down to $1 per kilogram, the point at which it is competitive with fossil fuel. Part of the Biden administration’s “Earthshots” initiative is a proposed $400 million investment in 2022 toward reaching the $1 per kilogram mark within 10 years. Hydrogen boosters like Mr. Ganzarski argue that while green hydrogen may initially be costly to make, the cost of not pursuing hydrogen aircraft may be greater. It is with some understatement that he said, “Emissions are not good for our health.”"
" GLASGOW — After two weeks of lofty speeches and bitter negotiations among nearly 200 nations, the question of whether the world will make significant progress to slow global warming still comes down to the actions of a handful of powerful nations that remain at odds over how best to address climate change. The United Nations global conference on climate change closed Saturday with a hard-fought agreement that calls on countries to return next year with stronger emissions-reduction targets and promises to double the money available to help countries cope with the effects of global warming. It also mentions by name — for the first time in a quarter century of global climate negotiations — the main cause of climate change: fossil fuels. But it did not succeed in helping the world avert the worst effects of climate change. Even if countries fulfill all the emissions promises they have made, they still put the world on a dangerous path toward a planet that will be warmer by some 2.4 degrees Celsius by year 2100, compared to preindustrial times. That misses by a wide margin the target of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees that scientists say is necessary to avert the worst consequences of warming. And it sets the stage for worsening storms, wildfires, droughts and sea-level rise as well as the social and economic upheaval that would accompany a widening climate crisis. ADVERTISEMENT A relative handful of political leaders around the world — in capital cities such as Washington, Beijing and New Delhi — hold much of the influence over whether those promises are kept and the arc of warming can be sufficiently bent away from disaster. But they face a complex combination of pressures: industry interests that stand in the way of regulations, demands from developing countries for money to help them transition away from fossil fuels, and an increasingly vocal movement among citizens to rein in emissions more quickly and deliver what they call climate justice. Chief among the leaders facing such pressures is President Biden, who is pursuing one of the biggest climate legislation efforts ever attempted in the United States, but who faces heavy resistance not only from Republicans, but from key senators within his own party. At the same time, in China, will Xi Jinping — just recently elevated to the pantheon of Communist Party leaders alongside Mao Zedong — be able or willing to corral provincial leaders to reduce their use of the coal that has powered China’s economic rise? Can India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, whose representatives weakened the final agreement’s language on coal at the 11th hour on Saturday, achieve his pledge of boosting renewable energy sources fivefold by 2030? Will Brazil keep its promise to join other countries in reversing deforestation in the Amazon? The pledges have kept the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees “within reach — but its pulse is weak,” said Alok Sharma, the British politician who presided over the summit. “And it will only survive if we keep our promises, if we translate commitments into rapid action.” ADVERTISEMENT The test of rapid action includes what his own government does. Britain, the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution and one of history’s largest emitters of planet-warming greenhouse gases, has said it intends to reduce its emissions by 68 percent by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. But Britain is also facing criticism for building new roads and airports — both potential sources of carbon dioxide emissions, which are among the main causes of global warming — and for continuing to extract oil and gas in the North Sea. Mikaela Loach, a young Briton who has sued the British government over an oil and gas project there, responded to the summit outcome on Twitter by dubbing it “#CopOut26.” “We cannot sit & wait for govs to make the right decisions,” she wrote. “WE all must be part of movements. WE have to act to end the fossil fuel era.” Also this weekend Greta Thunberg, the young climate activist, criticized the United States for its sales of offshore oil leases.    Courts have already begun to weigh in. Citizens in Germany, Pakistan and the Netherlands have sued to force their governments to take stronger action against climate change. In the United States, an environmental law nonprofit has sued the government on behalf of 21 young plaintiffs. And in the first climate case against a private company, a local Dutch court earlier this year instructed Royal Dutch Shell, one of the world’s largest oil companies, to sharply cut emissions from all of its global operations. The company is appealing the court action. ADVERTISEMENT For businesses, the biggest effect from the Glasgow climate meeting is likely to come from an accord that was announced on the sidelines: A coalition of the world’s biggest investors, banks and insurers that collectively control $130 trillion in assets pledged to use that capital to hit “net zero” emissions targets in their investments by 2050. That push would make limiting climate change a central focus of many major financial decisions. But lawmakers will likely face industry pressure over the writing of new regulations defining just what constitutes net zero investments Success or failure could end up depending significantly on what government regulators come up with, said Simon Stiell, the environment minister from Grenada, a Caribbean island nation that is particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise. “I expect there will be a significant lag between those pledges and it getting to a point where you have carrots and then you have the stick,” he said. “That piece isn’t part of the discussions that took place.” Beyond that, the consequences of the Glasgow summit for private businesses are less clear. In Europe, many companies have already adjusted their business models for the next decade to align with new European Union laws unveiled this past summer, ahead of the summit, which include high carbon taxes that apply to a widening swath of industries. A tense era in U.S.-China ties. The two powers are profoundly at odds as they jockey for influence beyond their own shores, compete in technology and maneuver for military advantages. Here’s what to know about the main fronts in U.S.-China relations: Pacific dominance. As China has built up its military presence, the U.S. has sought to widen its alliances in the region. A major potential flash point is Taiwan, the democratic island that the Communist Party regards as Chinese territory. Should the U.S. intervene there, it could reshape the regional order. Trade. The trade war started by the Trump administration is technically on pause. But the Biden administration has continued to protest China’s economic policies and impose tariffs on Chinese goods, signaling no thaw in trade relations. Technology. Internet giants have mostly been shut out of China, but plenty of U.S. tech companies still do big business there, raising cybersecurity concerns in Washington. Mr. Xi has said China needs to achieve technological “self-reliance.” Human rights. Under Mr. Xi, China’s confrontations with the U.S. over values and freedoms have become more frequent, including standoffs over Beijing’s crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and mass detentions of Muslims in Xinjiang. World leadership. China’s leaders see signs of American decline everywhere and they want a bigger voice in global leadership, seeking a greater role in Western-dominated institutions and courting allies that share their frustration with the West. Airbus, for example, is developing technology for hydrogen fueled planes. Europe’s auto industry is doubling down on shifting to electric vehicles, even if many carmakers did not join a pledge struck in Glasgow to phase out gasoline car sales. Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal, the largest steel maker outside of China, says it aims to reduce the company’s “carbon emissions intensity” in Europe by 35 percent by 2030. That is partly driven by high carbon taxes. ADVERTISEMENT Oil and gas companies, though, are nowhere near retreating from their core businesses even though it is the burning of fossil fuels that creates the carbon dioxide that is warming the world. The leaders of these companies say that they need their fossil fuel revenues to fund alternative energy investments — particularly at a time when oil and gas prices are enormously high. “We are a cash machine at these types of prices,” said Bernard Looney, chief executive of BP, on a call with analysts this month. European and American oil and gas companies could potentially gain from one contentious paragraph in the summit document. It calls for a “phasing down” of coal but says nothing about reducing oil and gas production. As coal declines, producers of liquefied natural gas, a competitor to coal in electricity generation, stand to gain new markets. A number of the promises made in Glasgow could pose a test for a broad swath of industries. For instance, a landmark deal to reduce deforestation by half by 2030 would inevitably affect a range of companies that use products linked to deforestation, such as palm oil and wood. “Almost every sector of our economy is part of the crime of deforestation,” said Mindy Lubber, who heads Ceres, a nonprofit that works with companies and investors to address their environmental effects. Some scientists saw the results of the Glasgow summit as a call to further scientific action. Maisa Rojas, a climate modeler at the University of Chile, said researchers need to better quantify the effects of climate change on vulnerable people and communities. That will help address an issue that was one of the most bitterly argued at Glasgow — “loss and damage,” or the question of what is owed to people who have barely contributed to global warming but are most harmed by it. “We need a systematic understanding and monitoring of what is going on,” said Dr. Rojas, who is the director of the university’s Center for Climate and Resilience Research. Indeed, one of the most important issues that at-risk countries like Grenada plan to press in the coming months is financing for loss and damage. These nations did not win their battle in Glasgow, instead getting only a commitment from rich countries to have a “dialogue” on the compensation issue in the future. Mr. Stiell argued that simply offering disaster relief, as some countries including the United States have suggested, is insufficient. Loss and damage funding is also required for the slow attrition of land due to sea-level rise and for agricultural losses from long running droughts. “There needs to be outcomes beyond a dialogue,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT Many of the youth activists who protested outside the talks said the promises didn’t go nearly far enough to address a problem that they are already living with. Mitzi Jonelle Tan, an activist from the Philippines who joined tens of thousands of activists on the streets of Glasgow to rally for “climate justice,” said the outcome felt like “a stab in the back from those who call themselves leaders.” “But the youth climate movement will keep fighting,” she said, “even when we are angry, sad, or afraid, because this is everything to our generation.” Liz Alderman, Winston Choi-Schagrin, Henry Fountain and Stanley Reed contributed reporting."
" Good morning. We’re covering an agreement at COP26, rising tensions on the Poland-Belarus border and a U.S. military cover-up in Syria. On Saturday, diplomats from nearly 200 countries struck an agreement to do more to fight climate change. Signed at the COP26 summit in Glasgow, the pact urged wealthy nations to “at least double” funding to protect poor nations from the hazards of a hotter planet. The pact also states that all nations will need to halve their carbon dioxide emissions this decade to hold warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, compared to preindustrial levels. It called on governments to return next year with stronger plans to cut emissions. And it is the first global climate agreement to explicitly mention the need to curb fossil fuels. Here are the key takeaways. However, the pact still leaves developing countries far short of the funds they need to build cleaner energy and cope with extreme weather. And it leaves unresolved how the burden of those cuts will be shared and what action is expected of individual nations. Next steps: The plan’s architects hope the agreement will show governments and corporations that more ambitious action is inevitable, empowering civil society groups and lawmakers to shift toward cleaner energy sources.

A legal officer flagged the bombing as a possible war crime that required an investigation, but the military never conducted an independent investigation. The Defense Department’s independent inspector general began an inquiry, but the report containing its findings was stalled and stripped of any mention of the strike.

" Before it started, the United Nations global climate summit in Glasgow known as COP26 was billed by its chief organizer as the “last, best hope” to save the planet. Halfway through, optimistic reviews of its progress noted that heads of state and titans of industry showed up in force to start the gathering with splashy new climate promises, a sign that momentum was building in the right direction. The pessimistic outlook? Gauzy promises mean little without concrete plans to follow through. The Swedish activist Greta Thunberg accused the conference of consisting of a lot of “blah, blah, blah.” On Saturday, diplomats from nearly 200 countries struck a major agreement aimed at intensifying efforts to fight climate change, by calling on governments to return next year with stronger plans to curb their planet-warming emissions and urging wealthy nations to “at least double” funding by 2025 to protect the most vulnerable nations from the hazards of a hotter planet. ADVERTISEMENT Here’s a look at some key takeaways from the 26th annual United Nations climate change summit. The agreement established a clear consensus that all nations need to do much more, immediately, to prevent a catastrophic rise in global temperatures. When the conference opened the U.N. Secretary General, António Guterres, said the top priority must be to limit the rise in global temperatures to just 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels. That’s the threshold, scientists have warned, beyond which the risk of calamities like deadly heat waves, water shortages and ecosystem collapse grows immensely. (The world has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius.) “The reality is you’ve got two different truths going on,” Helen Mountford, vice president for climate and economics at the World Resources Institute, said last week. “We’ve made much more progress than we ever could’ve imagined a couple years ago. But it’s still nowhere near enough.” The agreement outlines specific steps the world should take, from slashing global carbon dioxide emissions nearly in half by 2030 to curbing emissions of methane, another potent greenhouse gas. And it sets up new rules to hold countries accountable for the progress they make — or fail to make. The environment minister of the Maldives, Shauna Aminath, said the latest text lacked the “urgency” that vulnerable countries like hers required. “What looks balanced and pragmatic to other parties will not help the Maldives adapt in time,” she said. ADVERTISEMENT The final agreement leaves unresolved the crucial question of how much and how quickly each nation should cut its emissions over the next decade. Rich countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan and much of western Europe, account for just 12 percent of the global population today but are responsible for 50 percent of all the planet-warming greenhouse gases released from fossil fuels and industry over the past 170 years. President Biden and European leaders have insisted that countries like India, Indonesia and South Africa need to accelerate their shift away from coal power and other fossil fuels. But those countries counter that they lack the financial resources to do so, and that rich countries have been stingy with aid. A decade ago, the world’s wealthiest economies pledged to mobilize $100 billion per year in climate finance for poorer countries by 2020. But they have fallen short by tens of billions of dollars annually. The COP26 agreement still leaves many developing countries without the funds they need to build cleaner energy and cope with increasingly extreme weather disasters. One of the biggest fights at the summit in Glasgow revolved around whether — and how — the world’s wealthiest nations, which are disproportionately responsible for global warming to date, should compensate poorer nations for the damages caused by rising temperatures. Calls for this fund, an issue called “loss and damage,” is separate from money to help poorer countries adapt to a changing climate. Loss and damage is a matter of historic responsibility, its proponents say, and would pay for irreparable losses, such as the disappearance of national territory, culture and ecosystems. ADVERTISEMENT The Paris agreement in 2015 urged clearer rules on how to allow polluting companies and countries to buy and trade permits to lower global emissions, but the extremely dense and technical subject continued as a topic of discussion well into Saturday in Glasgow. Negotiators announced a major deal on how to regulate the fast-growing global market in carbon offsets, in which one company or country compensates for its own emissions by paying someone else to reduce theirs. One of the thorniest technical issues is how to properly account for these global trades so that any reductions in emissions aren’t overestimated or double-counted. Vulnerable countries insist that rich nations should grant them a share of proceeds from carbon market transactions to help them build resilience to climate change. The United States and the European Union have opposed doing so, but island nations in particular want a mechanism to ensure that carbon trading leads to an overall reduction in global emissions. “We want a credible market that will deliver reductions in emissions, not just a free pass for countries to buy cheap credits offshore to meet their national requirements,” said Ian Fry, a negotiator for the Solomon Islands, an archipelago in the southwest Pacific Ocean. U.S. and China: The two countries announced a joint agreement to do more to cut emissions this decade, and China committed for the first time to develop a plan to reduce methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The pact between the rivals, which are the world’s two biggest polluters, surprised delegates to the summit. The agreement was short on specifics and while China agreed to “phase down” coal starting in 2026, it did not specify by how much or over what period of time. Deforestation: Leaders of more than 100 countries, including Brazil, China, Russia and the United States, vowed to end deforestation by 2030. The agreement covers about 85 percent of the world’s forests, which are crucial to absorbing carbon dioxide and slowing the pace of global warming. Some advocacy groups criticized the agreement as lacking teeth, noting that similar efforts have failed in the past. Methane: More than 100 countries agreed to cut emissions of methane, a potent planet-warming gas, 30 percent by the end of this decade. The pledge was part of a push by the Biden administration, which also announced that the Environmental Protection Agency would limit the methane coming from about one million oil and gas rigs across the United States. India: India joined the growing chorus of nations pledging to reach “net zero” emissions, setting a 2070 deadline to stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. One of the world’s largest consumers of coal, India also said that it would significantly expand the portion of its total energy mix that comes from renewable sources, and that half of its energy would come from sources other than fossil fuels by 2030. There was a clear gender and generation gap at the Glasgow talks. Those with the power to make decisions about how much the world warms in the coming decades are mostly old and male. Those who are angriest about the pace of climate action are mostly young and female. Malik Amin Aslam, an adviser to the prime minister of Pakistan, scoffed at some of the distant net zero goals being announced during the conference, including India’s: “With an average age of 60, I don’t think anyone in the negotiating room would live to experience that net zero in 2070,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT On the first day of the conference, Greta Thunberg joined scores of protesters on the streets outside the United Nations climate conference in Glasgow. Throughout the two-week conference she and other young climate activists — including Vanessa Nakate, Dominika Lasota and Mitzi Tan — made numerous appearances at protests. Ms. Thunberg told the BBC in an interview ahead of the summit that she had not been officially invited to speak. She added that she thought the organizers had not invited a lot of young speakers because they “might be scared that if they invite too many ‘radical’ young people then that might make them look bad,” she said, using air quotations. The climate summit, which was delayed last year, is one of the biggest international gatherings held during the coronavirus pandemic. Many summit participants traveled from countries where vaccines are still not widely available. Globally, fewer than half of all adults have been vaccinated against Covid-19, illustrating the inequities of vaccination. Travel and quarantine restrictions meant additional costs in both time and money for lodging, which made the trip impossible for some. And some participants, like President Xi Jinping of China, Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, decided against traveling at all. Partway through, conference organizers issued a letter of apology to participants for the long lines and video difficulties, saying that planning around Covid restrictions has been challenging. Patricia Espinosa, the executive secretary of the U.N. climate body, asked attendees to “bear with us” as organizers grappled with the complex arrangements, like ensuring that all those entering the venue tested negative for the coronavirus, and enforcing controls on the number of people in meeting rooms."
" Antes de que comenzara, la cumbre internacional de las Naciones Unidas sobre el clima celebrada en Escocia y conocida como COP 26 fue promocionada por su principal organizador como “la mejor y última esperanza” para salvar el planeta. A medio camino, las evaluaciones optimistas de los avances señalaron que los jefes de Estado y los titanes de la industria llegaron con fuerza a la reunión con nuevas promesas de alto impacto para el clima, un indicio de que se estaba cobrando impulso en la dirección correcta. ¿Cuál fue la perspectiva pesimista? Las promesas vagas no significan mucho sin planes concretos para cumplirlas. La activista sueca Greta Thunberg acusó a la conferencia, celebrada en Glasgow, de ser puro “bla bla bla”. ADVERTISEMENT El sábado, diplomáticos de casi 200 países cerraron un acuerdo importante destinado a intensificar los esfuerzos para combatir el cambio climático, en el que se invita a los gobiernos a regresar el próximo año con planes más sólidos para frenar las emisiones que contribuyen al calentamiento del planeta y se insta a las naciones ricas a “duplicar al menos” el financiamiento para proteger a los países más vulnerables de los riesgos que implican las temperaturas más elevadas para 2025. A continuación, un vistazo a algunas de las conclusiones clave de la 26.ª cumbre anual de las Naciones Unidas sobre el cambio climático. El acuerdo estableció un consenso claro de que todas las naciones deben hacer mucho más, y de inmediato, para prevenir un aumento catastrófico de las temperaturas a nivel mundial. Cuando se inauguró la conferencia, el secretario general de la ONU António Guterres declaró que la principal prioridad debe ser limitar el incremento de las temperaturas globales a solo 1,5 grados Celsius por encima de los niveles preindustriales. Los científicos han advertido que rebasar ese umbral aumenta enormemente el riesgo de que se desaten desastres como olas de calor letales, escasez de agua y el colapso de ecosistemas. (La temperatura del planeta ya se ha incrementado 1,1 grados Celsius). “La realidad es que se tienen dos verdades diferentes en juego”, dijo la semana pasada Helen Mountford, vicepresidenta para el clima y la economía en el Instituto de Recursos Mundiales. “Hemos logrado avances mucho mayores de los que podríamos haber imaginado hace dos años. Pero seguimos estando muy lejos de lo necesario”. ADVERTISEMENT El acuerdo esboza medidas específicas que el mundo debe tomar, desde recortar casi a la mitad las emisiones globales de dióxido de carbono para 2030 hasta frenar las emisiones de metano, otro potente gas de efecto invernadero. Además, establece nuevas reglas para responsabilizar a los países de los avances que consigan, o no consigan. La ministra del Medioambiente de Maldivas, Shauna Aminath, declaró que el texto más reciente carecía de la “urgencia” que requieren los países vulnerables como el suyo. “Lo que parece equilibrado y pragmático para otras partes no ayudará a Maldivas a adaptarse a tiempo”, afirmó. El acuerdo final deja sin respuesta la pregunta crucial de cuántas emisiones debe recortar cada país durante la próxima década y con cuánta rapidez. Los países ricos, entre ellos Estados Unidos, Canadá, Japón y gran parte de Europa occidental, representan solo el 12 por ciento de la población mundial en la actualidad, pero son responsables del 50 por ciento de todos los gases de efecto invernadero relacionados con el calentamiento global que han emitido los combustibles fósiles y la industria en los últimos 170 años. El presidente de Estados Unidos, Joe Biden, y los dirigentes europeos han insistido en que países como India, Indonesia y Sudáfrica necesitan acelerar el paso al que se alejan de la energía generada por carbón y otros combustibles fósiles. Sin embargo, esos países replican que no tienen los recursos financieros para hacerlo, y que las naciones ricas han escatimado su asistencia. Hace una década, las economías más poderosas del mundo prometieron destinar 100.000 millones de dólares anuales al financiamiento climático de los países más pobres para 2020. Pero todavía deben decenas de miles de millones de dólares al año. El acuerdo de la COP 26 sigue sin otorgar a los países en desarrollo los fondos que necesitan para recurrir a energías menos contaminantes y enfrentar los desastres del clima cada vez más extremos. Una de las discusiones más grandes en la cumbre se dio en torno a si las naciones más ricas, que son responsables de manera desproporcionada por el calentamiento del planeta hasta el momento, deben o no compensar a las naciones más pobres por los daños derivados de las temperaturas elevadas, y cómo deben hacerlo. ADVERTISEMENT Este fondo, conocido como “mecanismo de pérdidas y daños”, es independiente del dinero para ayudar a los países pobres a adaptarse al clima cambiante. El tema de “pérdidas y daños” es una cuestión de responsabilidad histórica, según afirman sus proponentes, y cubriría pérdidas irreparables, como la desaparición de territorios, culturas y ecosistemas nacionales. El Acuerdo de París de 2015 instó a establecer reglas más claras sobre cómo permitirles a las empresas y naciones contaminantes comprar e intercambiar permisos para reducir las emisiones globales, pero este tema, tan denso y técnico, siguió presente en los debates hasta bien entrado el sábado en Glasgow. Los negociadores anunciaron un acuerdo importante sobre cómo regular el floreciente mercado mundial de las compensaciones de carbono, en el que una empresa o un país compensa sus propias emisiones al pagarle a un tercero para que reduzca las suyas. Uno de los temas más espinosos es cómo registrar estos intercambios globales de modo que ninguna reducción se sobrevalore o se contabilice dos veces. Los países vulnerables insisten en que los ricos deben concederles una parte de las ganancias de las transacciones en el mercado de bonos de carbono para ayudarles a adquirir resiliencia ante el cambio climático. Estados Unidos y la Unión Europea se han opuesto a hacerlo, pero las naciones isleñas en particular desean un mecanismo para asegurarse de que el comercio de bonos de carbono conduzca a una reducción de las emisiones globales. “Queremos un mercado creíble que entregue reducciones en las emisiones no solo un permiso para que los países compren créditos baratos en paraísos fiscales para cumplir con sus requisitos nacionales”, dijo Ian Fry, un negociador de las islas Solomón, un archipiélago en el suroeste del Pacífico. Estados Unidos y China: Los dos países anunciaron un acuerdo conjunto para hacer más a favor de reducir las emisiones esta década, y China se comprometió por primera vez a desarrollar un plan para reducir el metano, un potente gas de efecto invernadero. El pacto entre las potencias rivales, que son los dos mayores contaminadores del mundo, sorprendió a los delegados en la cumbre. El acuerdo fue somero en detalles y aunque China acordó “reducir gradualmente” el carbón a partir de 2026, no especificó cuánto o durante qué período de tiempo. Deforestación: los líderes de más de 100 países, incluidos Brasil, China, Rusia y Estados Unidos, prometieron poner fin a la deforestación para 2030. El acuerdo cubre aproximadamente el 85 por ciento de los bosques del mundo, que son cruciales para absorber dióxido de carbono y ralentizar el ritmo del calentamiento global. Algunos grupos de defensa criticaron el acuerdo por carecer de fuerza y señalaron que esfuerzos similares han fracasado en el pasado. Metano: Más de 100 países acordaron reducir las emisiones de metano, un potente gas que calienta el planeta, en un 30 por ciento para fines de esta década. La promesa fue parte de un impulso de la gestión de Biden, que también anunció que la Agencia de Protección Ambiental limitaría el metano proveniente de aproximadamente un millón de plataformas de petróleo y gas en Estados Unidos. India: El país se unió al creciente coro de naciones que se comprometieron a alcanzar emisiones “netas cero”, estableciendo una fecha límite de 2070 para dejar de agregar gases de efecto invernadero a la atmósfera. El país, uno de los mayores consumidores de carbón del mundo, también dijo que expandirá significativamente la porción de su mezcla energética total que proviene de fuentes renovables, y que la mitad de su energía provendrá de fuentes distintas a los combustibles fósiles para 2030. Se vio una clara brecha generacional y de género en las charlas de Glasgow. Las personas que tienen el poder de decidir cuánto se calienta el mundo en las próximas décadas son, en su mayoría, hombres blancos de la tercera edad. Las personas más molestas por el ritmo de las acciones climáticas son, en su mayoría, mujeres jóvenes. Malik Amin Aslam, asesor del primer ministro de Pakistán, se burló de algunas de las metas lejanas de cero emisiones netas que se anunciaron durante la conferencia, incluida la de India: “Con una edad promedio de 60 años, dudo que alguien en la sala de negociaciones esté vivo para experimentar ese cero neto en 2070”, declaró. ADVERTISEMENT El primer día de la conferencia, Greta Thunberg se unió a decenas de manifestantes en las calles fuera de la cumbre. A lo largo de las dos semanas que duró la conferencia, ella y otras jóvenes activistas —incluyendo a Vanessa Nakate, Dominika Lasota y Mitzi Tan— hicieron varias apariciones en protestas. Thunberg le dijo a la BBC en una entrevista previa a la cumbre que no había sido invitada a dar un discurso de manera oficial. Agregó que creía que los organizadores no habían invitado a muchos ponentes jóvenes porque “quizá temen que si invitan a demasiados jóvenes ‘radicales’, estos podrían hacerlos quedar mal”, declaró, trazando comillas en el aire. Realizar las conversaciones durante la pandemia ya era en sí mismo un desafío La cumbre sobre el clima, que se retrasó el año pasado, es una de las reuniones internacionales más importantes celebradas durante la pandemia de coronavirus. Muchos participantes de la cumbre viajaron desde países donde las vacunas aún no están ampliamente disponibles. A nivel mundial, menos de la mitad de todos los adultos se han vacunado contra la COVID-19, lo que ilustra las inequidades de la vacunación. Las restricciones de viaje y cuarentena significaron costos adicionales tanto en tiempo como en dinero para el alojamiento, lo que hizo que el viaje fuera imposible para algunos. Y algunos participantes, como el presidente Xi Jinping de China, Vladimir V. Putin de Rusia y Jair Bolsonaro de Brasil, decidieron simplemente no acudir. A mitad de camino, los organizadores de la conferencia emitieron una carta de disculpa a los participantes por las largas filas y las dificultades del video, diciendo que planificar ha sido un desafío debido a las restricciones pandémicas. Patricia Espinosa, la secretaria ejecutiva del organismo climático de la ONU, pidió a los asistentes que “nos tengan paciencia” mientras los organizadores lidiaban con arreglos muy complejos, como asegurarse de que todos los que ingresaran al lugar dieran negativo al coronavirus y hacer cumplir los controles de aforo."
" Michelle Butler was 21 weeks pregnant with twins — a boy and a girl — when she felt contractions. As her sister drove her to the hospital, Ms. Butler prayed for them to stop. But the contractions persisted and on July 5, 2020, at about 1 p.m., the babies, C’Asya Zy-Nell and Curtis Zy-Keith Means, were born. She was told that the infants, who each weighed under a pound, had less than a 1 percent chance of survival. They were quickly placed on ventilators. C’Asya died less than a day later. Ms. Butler, 35, said she had held her in her arms, prayed for her and told her she loved her. But Curtis hung on. He was trying to breathe on his own and his heart rate was improving, showing a resilience that shocked longtime nurses and doctors at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. ADVERTISEMENT “He was striking even from the first breath,” said Dr. Brian Sims, a neonatologist at the hospital who cared for Curtis. “He just showed that he was going to be a strong, strong fellow from Day 1.” Curtis was released in April, after 275 days in the neonatal intensive care unit. On Wednesday, Guinness World Records named Curtis, who was born 132 days early, the world’s most premature infant to live to a first birthday. He is now 16 months old. Babies born that premature seldom live more than a day, Dr. Sims said. “The truth is no baby has survived at this age,” he said. “We say less than 1 percent, but it’s really closer to zero.” Curtis’s early birth reflects the persistently high frequency of premature births in the United States, where the yearly rate of preterm births hovers at about 10 percent, according to the March of Dimes. In Alabama, the rate was 12.5 percent in 2019, according to the organization. Curtis was born one month after the previous record-holder, Richard Hutchinson, who was born in Minneapolis after only 21 weeks and two days of gestation. ADVERTISEMENT The risk of preterm births is even higher for Black women, who are over 50 percent more likely than white women to give birth early, according to the Population Reference Bureau. Myriad factors can contribute to premature births, including a mother’s age and income, her health and her access to prenatal care. Access to contraception can play a role. Women who have pregnancies in quick succession are also at risk of giving birth early, said Bruce Bekkar, a gynecologist and obstetrician who serves as the chairman of the Public Health Advisory Council at the Climate Action Campaign in San Diego. Climate change could be exacerbating the problem, according to a 2020 study that examined more than 32 million births in the United States and found that pregnant women exposed to high temperatures or air pollution were more likely to have children who were premature, underweight or stillborn. It is too early to conclude how large a role climate change is playing in low birth weights and preterm births, said Dr. Bekkar, one of the authors of the 2020 study. But the evidence that it is a significant factor is compelling, he said, noting that the number of preterm births fell at least 20 percent in California in areas where fossil fuel plants shut down. Other events caused at least in part by climate change, like the growing number of wildfires in the western part of the United States and the increasing frequency and intensity of heat waves, have been associated with preterm births. “It’s going to get worse,” Dr. Bekkar said. Climate change “is going to continue to put increasing pressure on premature birthrates.” ADVERTISEMENT Dr. Sims said it was not clear why Ms. Butler went into early labor. She had access to neonatal care and saw a doctor regularly, he said. Ms. Butler said her cervix began to open up shortly before the birth. She underwent surgery at UAB Hospital to close it and was discharged from the hospital on July 4. Her sister was driving her home over severely bumpy roads when she began feeling the contractions, Ms. Butler said. She said that when her daughter died, she had little time to grieve, knowing that Curtis was still trying to survive. “I had to pull myself together and be strong for him,” Ms. Butler said. The doctors told her that with a baby born that early, they would have to “take it day by day, hour by hour.” “It was a roller coaster,” Ms. Butler said. “He had his good and bad days, for sure.” Ms. Butler, who also has a 7-year-old daughter and a 14-year-old son, drove 90 minutes several days a week from her home in Greene County, Ala., to visit Curtis at the hospital. The nurses showed her how to feed him, change him and keep his feeding tube clean. When he was stable enough, he was placed on his mother’s chest for skin-to-skin contact, said Sumita Gray, a nurse in the hospital’s regional neonatal intensive care unit. Ms. Butler balanced visits to the hospital with her job at a catfish processing plant. Two weeks before Curtis was discharged, Ms. Butler quit her job, knowing she would need to spend more time with the baby. ADVERTISEMENT Ms. Gray said she was thrilled when she saw him recently, when the doctors and nurses who cared for Curtis reunited with him and Ms. Butler to present them with the Guinness World Records plaque. “He looked great,” she said. “He was roly-poly.” Curtis still relies on a feeding tube and a nasal cannula, which helps supplement his oxygen. He needs speech and physical therapy, Ms. Butler said. But the doctors said they were pleased with his progress. “He’s very interactive,” Dr. Sims said. “He laughs, he gets an attitude. All the things that you expect from a baby so far, he does those things.” Ms. Butler said Curtis, who now weighs 18 pounds 9 ounces, sleeps all night and seldom whines. “He’s a happy baby,” she said. “He’s not a crybaby.”"
" GLASGOW — Diplomats from nearly 200 countries on Saturday struck a major agreement aimed at intensifying global efforts to fight climate change by calling on governments to return next year with stronger plans to curb their planet-warming emissions and urging wealthy nations to “at least double” funding to protect poor nations from the hazards of a hotter planet. The new deal will not, on its own, solve global warming, despite the urgent demands of many of the thousands of politicians, environmentalists and protesters who gathered at the Glasgow climate summit. Its success or failure will hinge on whether world leaders now follow through with new policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions. And the deal still leaves vulnerable countries far short of the funds they need to cope with increasing weather disasters. The talks underscored the complexity of trying to persuade scores of countries, each with its own economic interests and domestic politics, to act in unison for the greater good. But the agreement established a clear consensus that all nations must do much more, immediately, to prevent a harrowing rise in global temperatures. And it set up transparency rules to hold countries accountable for the progress they make or fail to make. ADVERTISEMENT John Kerry, the United States climate envoy, entered the plenary hall Saturday evening with his arm around the shoulder of Xie Zhenhua, China’s chief climate negotiator. Last minute deal-making could be seen on the floor as Mr. Xie and Mr. Kerry huddled, mask to mask, with Alok Sharma, the British politician who led the United Nations summit.  Architects of the agreement hoped it would send a powerful signal to capitals and corporate boardrooms around the globe that more ambitious action on climate change is inevitable, which could in turn would empower civil society groups and lawmakers working to shift countries away from burning oil, gas and coal for energy in favor of cleaner sources like wind, solar and nuclear power. “The train is moving and all countries need to get on board,” said Ani Dasgupta, president of the World Resources Institute. “If the world is going to beat back the climate crisis, no one can sit on the sidelines.” ADVERTISEMENT Yet many others said the deal failed to meet the moment, in a year of deadly heat in Canada, devastating floods in Germany and New York, and raging wildfires in Siberia. At the start of the two-week summit, leaders, including President Biden and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, framed the meeting as the world’s last, best chance to save the planet. The final deal is “not in line with the urgency and scale required,” said Shauna Aminath, environment minister of the Maldives, an archipelago of low-lying islands in the Indian Ocean that has been inhabited for thousands of years but could be inundated within three generations because of rising seas. “What looks balanced and pragmatic to other parties will not help the Maldives adapt in time,” she said. “It will be too late for the Maldives.” In the final hours of talks Saturday night, negotiators clashed over wording that would have called on countries to “phase out” coal power and government subsidies for oil and gas. Fossil fuels have never been explicitly mentioned in a global climate agreement before, even though they are the dominant cause of global warming. In the end, at the urging of India, which argued that fossil fuels were still needed for its development, “phase out” was changed to “phase down.” Switzerland’s representative, Simonetta Sommaruga, assailed the change: “We do not need to phase down, but to phase out.” Going into the summit, world leaders said their ultimate goal was to prevent Earth from heating more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, compared to preindustrial levels. Past that threshold, scientists have warned, the risk of deadly heat waves, destructive storms, water scarcity and ecosystem collapse grows immensely. The world has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius. ADVERTISEMENT But even as countries vowed to step up their climate efforts both before and during the Glasgow summit, they are still falling far short. The detailed plans that governments have made to curb fossil-fuel emissions and deforestation between now and 2030 would put the world on pace to warm by roughly 2.4 degrees Celsius this century, according to analysts at Climate Action Tracker, a research group. “Countries still don’t seem to understand that we’re in an emergency situation and we need to cut emissions much faster this decade, or else any hope of staying at 1.5 degrees will be lost,” said Niklas Höhne, a German climatologist and founding partner of NewClimate Institute, which created the Climate Action Tracker. A major focus of this year’s talks was how to push countries to do more. Under the last big climate deal, the Paris Agreement in 2015, governments weren’t formally scheduled to come back with new climate pledges until 2025, which many experts said was far too late for a major course correction. The new agreement in Glasgow asks countries to come back by the end of next year with stronger pledges to cut emissions by 2030. Though the agreement states clearly that, on average, all nations will need to slash their carbon dioxide emissions nearly in half this decade to hold warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, it leaves unresolved the question of exactly how the burden of those cuts will be shared among nations. It remains to be seen if countries will follow through; there are no sanctions or penalties if they fail to do so. Ahead of Glasgow, some governments like the United States and European Union did step up their climate pledges under the Paris Agreement. Yet others — like Australia, China, Brazil and Russia — barely improved on their short-term plans. ADVERTISEMENT Money, meanwhile, remained a huge sticking point in the talks. A number of swiftly industrializing countries, such as India and Indonesia, have said they would be willing to accelerate a shift away from coal power if they received financial help from richer countries. But so far, that help has been slow to arrive. A decade ago, the world’s wealthiest economies pledged to mobilize $100 billion per year in climate finance for poorer countries by 2020. But they are still falling short by tens of billions of dollars per year. At the same time, only a small fraction of that aid to date has gone toward measures to help poorer countries cope with the hazards of a hotter planet, such as sea walls or early-warning systems for floods and droughts. According to one recent study, some African nations are spending up to 9 percent of their gross domestic product on adaptation, while still only addressing about one-fifth of their needs. The new agreement tries to fill in some of those gaps. It calls out rich countries for failing to meet the $100 billion goal and urges them to “at least double” finance for adaptation by 2025. It also sets up a process for figuring out a collective goal for long-term finance, although that process could take years, and developing countries say they may ultimately need trillions of dollars this decade. Tina Stege, the climate ambassador for the Marshall Islands, called the promises for more money “a step toward helping countries like mine who must transform our very physical environment in the coming years to survive the onslaught of climate change.” Separately, vulnerable countries like Bangladesh had also called for a new stream of funding to help countries recover from climate disasters they can’t adapt to, paid for by industrialized nations like the United States and the European Union that are historically responsible for most of the extra greenhouse gases now heating the atmosphere. In diplomatic speak, this is known as “loss and damage.” ADVERTISEMENT But wealthy nations blocked a proposal to set up a new fund for this purpose, instead agreeing only to initiate a “dialogue” on the issue in future talks. “The needs of the world’s vulnerable people have been sacrificed on the altar of the rich world’s selfishness,” said Mohamed Adow, an activist with Power Shift Africa. But, he added, “loss and damage is now up the political agenda in a way it was never before and the only way out is for it to be eventually delivered.” Separately, negotiators in Glasgow announced a major deal on how to regulate the fast-growing global market in carbon offsets, in which one company or country compensates for its own emissions by paying someone else to reduce theirs. One of the thorniest technical issues is how to properly account for these global trades so that any reductions in emissions aren’t overestimated or double-counted. The summit provided signs of growing momentum for climate action, albeit with caveats. On the sidelines at the talks, clusters of countries announced initiatives they were undertaking on their own. More than 100 countries agreed to cut emissions of methane, a potent planet-warming gas, by 30 percent this decade. Another 130 countries vowed to halt deforestation by 2030 and commit billions of dollars toward the effort. Dozens of other countries vowed to phase out their coal plants and sales of gasoline-powered vehicles over the next few decades. Activists noted that those promises were voluntary and often didn’t include major emitters like China or Russia. But others argued they could pressure heads of state and titans of industry to do more. ADVERTISEMENT “If you tried to get every single country to agree to get rid of internal combustion engines through the formal U.N. process, you’d get nowhere,” said Nigel Topping, who was chosen by the United Nations as its “high level climate action champion.” “But if you get a bunch of countries and major automakers to stand up and say, ‘we’re doing this,’ it starts forcing the market, and pretty soon more and more companies start signing on.” On top of that, most major economies have now pledged to reach net zero emissions by a certain date, essentially a promise to stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. The United States and European Union said they would do so by 2050, China by 2060. At Glasgow, India joined the chorus, saying it would reach net zero by 2070. When Climate Action Tracker looked at these additional promises, it estimated that the world could conceivably limit global warming to 1.8 degrees Celsius by 2100, although, so far, most countries haven’t put policies in place to get there. Calculations like that persuaded many politicians and environmentalists that the dream of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees might yet be in reach, as long as governments can be pressured to follow through on what they’ve promised. “It’s meek, it’s weak and the 1.5 Celsius goal is only just alive, but a signal has been sent that the era of coal is ending,” said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, of the climate deal. “And that matters.” Somini Sengupta contributed reporting."
" The global climate summit wrapping up in Glasgow is known as COP26, with COP standing for Conference of the Parties. In diplomatic parlance, “the parties” refers to the 197 nations that agreed to a new environmental pact, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, at a meeting in 1992. That year, the United States and other countries ratified the treaty, which aims to combat “dangerous human interference with the climate system” and stabilize levels of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. This is the 26th time countries have gathered under the convention. Hence, COP26. A lot of other words and phrases are being bandied about as leaders try to agree on final wording of an agreement. Here some of the ones you’re most likely to hear and read, plus an more in-depth explanation of the climate conference:"
" GLASGOW —  Negotiators from 200 countries appeared to be closing in on an agreement aimed at setting conditions to prevent dangerous levels of global warming late Saturday, but not without tension over how to pay countries that are least responsible for the problem but suffering irreparable harms. John Kerry, the U.S. climate envoy, said, “It is time to come together for future generations in ways that none of us thought we might have an opportunity to do.” He called the text “a powerful statement.” Not everyone agreed. The latest text, said Shauna Aminath, environment minister of the Maldives, lacked the “urgency” that vulnerable countries like hers required. “What looks balanced and pragmatic to other parties will not help the Maldives adapt in time,” she said. Representatives spent much of the day arguing over language in a revised draft agreement — the third version cobbled together during the summit, known as COP26. By tradition, all countries must agree on language; if any one objects, the talks deadlock. ADVERTISEMENT Frans Timmermans, vice president of the European Union, urged negotiators to accept the third version and said he feared “stumbling in this marathon a few meters short of the finish line.” He pleaded for each country to set aside its particular concerns to focus on the larger crisis. “For heavens’ sake, don’t kill this moment by asking for more text, different text, deleting that and deleting this,” he said, urging the group to “act with the urgency that is essential for our survival. Please embrace this text so we can bring hope to the hearts of our children and grandchildren.” Andrea Meza, the Environment and Energy Minister of Costa Rica, summed it up this way: “We don’t have a perfect package but we have a possible package.” The latest draft, which is broadly similar to one released on Friday, called on nations to return next year, instead of 2025, with stronger pledges to cut planet-warming emissions in this decade. It urged wealthy nations to “at least double” by 2025 the financial aid that they provide to developing countries to help them adapt to heat waves, floods, droughts and wildfires. It retained language calling on countries to accelerate efforts “toward the phaseout of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, recognizing the need for support toward a just transition.” That language recognizes the need to help workers in polluting countries who could be displaced after a transition to wind, solar or other green energy. ADVERTISEMENT The reference to “fossil fuels” would be the first time those words are mentioned in an international climate accord, despite the fact that burning fossil fuels is a root cause of global warming. “The Glasgow Climate Pact failed to prioritize climate finance for developing countries to transition away from fossil fuels, adapt to worsening impacts, and cope with irreparable loss and damage from climate change,” Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said. The summit host, Britain, had said its goal was to ensure that the planet would not heat more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, by 2100, compared with the average global temperature during the Industrial Revolution. That is the threshold beyond which scientists say devastating heat waves, fires and floods become significantly more likely. That goal is nowhere within reach. “It’s meek, it’s weak, and the 1.5 Celsius goal is only just alive,” said Jennifer Morgan, who heads Greenpeace. “But a signal has been sent that the era of coal is ending. And that matters.” Dan Jorgensen, Denmark’s minister of climate, energy and utilities, said he was optimistic that the coal and fossil fuel language would remain in the final agreement. “We all agree that climate change is the biggest threat to our civilization, and we all know what the causes are,” he said. “This is not about shaming those countries. We all need to acknowledge that countries that need to move away from coal also need help.” Lisa Friedman contributed reporting"
" GLASGOW — A third draft of a new global climate change agreement was released on Saturday morning, and many are hoping this time is the charm. United Nations climate change negotiations were well into overtime as diplomats worked to write a document. To reach a final agreement, all parties must approve. By tradition, if one country objects to language in the agreement, the talks can deadlock. The goals: to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, by the end of this century, and to help the world’s poorest countries cope with climate disruptions. Beyond the 1.5-degree threshold, according to scientists, the danger of devastating heat waves, fires and floods rises significantly. Currently, that goal is nowhere within reach. The world has already warmed an average of 1.1 degrees Celsius since preindustrial times, although some places have heated more than that. One analysis found that even if all the pledges countries have made in Glasgow to curb emissions this decade are kept, temperatures will still skyrocket by 2.4 degrees Celsius by 2100. ADVERTISEMENT As of early Saturday, negotiators were wrestling with four major sticking points: whether countries should be asked to return next year with stronger emissions plans; how much money should go developing countries; how to structure a global market for carbon; and how, or even whether, to call for a phaseout of coal and fossil fuel subsidies. Compelling countries to strengthen their emissions targets by the end of 2022 could be key to keeping global temperatures from rising to far more dangerous levels. But some big greenhouse gas polluters — like China, Russia and Saudi Arabia — have been pushing back, arguing that they should not be held to the same standard as nations historically responsible for most carbon emissions, like the United States and the countries of the European Union."
" GLASGOW — The international climate talks went into overtime Friday evening, as negotiators wrestled behind closed doors over several sticking points in an agreement that could determine whether nations can prevent the planet from growing dangerously hot by midcentury. A draft agreement released Friday morning called for a doubling of money to help developing countries cope with climate impacts, and said nations should strengthen their emissions-cutting targets by next year. The document urged countries to accelerate a coal phaseout and eliminate subsidies for fossil fuels. Negotiators from about 200 countries worked into Saturday morning, arguing over several aspects of the document, including whether countries should be asked to return next year with stronger emissions plans, if wealthy countries should give financial help to developing countries suffering the worst impacts, and how to structure a global market for carbon. ADVERTISEMENT They even disputed whether the final agreement should mention the words “fossil fuels,” which have never before appeared in a global climate agreement even though their combustion is the principal cause of climate change. One of the most divisive questions involves whether industrialized countries that have prospered by burning coal, oil and gas should pay developing countries for the irreparable harms they have caused. The state of the negotiations reflected the intensifying pressure on polluter countries to not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions far more quickly than they have been willing, but also to address the damage that those emissions have exacted on countries least responsible for the problem. ADVERTISEMENT “There’s a huge disconnect between where we are, where we will be based on current projections and where we need to be in terms of what science is telling us,” said Saber Hossain Chowdhury, a negotiator from Bangladesh. A new draft text was expected Saturday morning, according to summit organizers. To reach a final agreement, all parties must approve. By tradition, if one country objects to language in the agreement, the talks can deadlock. The summit host, Britain, had said its goal was to ensure that the planet would not heat more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, compared with preindustrial times. That is the threshold beyond which scientists say devastating heat waves, fires and floods become significantly more likely. That goal is nowhere within reach. The world has already warmed an average of 1.1 degrees Celsius since the Industrial Revolution, although some places have already heated more than that. One analysis found that even if all the pledges  made in Glasgow are kept, temperatures will still skyrocket by 2.4 degrees Celsius by 2100. The Kenyan environment minister, Keriako Tobiko, noted that an average global temperature rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius would translate into 3 degrees in Africa, intensifying erratic patterns of rainfall and drought that are already punishing farmers. “In Kenya and Africa, we cry, we bleed. We bleed when it rains, we cry when it doesn’t rain,” he said. “So for us, ambition, 1.5 is not a statistic. It is a matter of life and death.” Pressure mounted throughout the day to deliver a strong final document. At noon, more than 700 climate activists marched through the convention center where the summit is being held, chanting “climate justice” and calling for more ambitious targets. They spilled out into the streets to join noisy throngs of more protesters. ADVERTISEMENT The demonstrations enlivened the two-week-long proceedings, which have been dominated by well-crafted speeches onstage and arguments over verbs in small meeting rooms. But they also served as a reminder to politicians and diplomats of the demands of ordinary citizens. Midway through the summit,  more than 100,000 protesters filled the streets of Glasgow, many of them young people, angrily demanding that world leaders take aggressive action to deal with the climate crisis. A British diplomat closely following the negotiations said talks would go down to the wire. “There are a number of key issues still in play here, and we’re still some distance from reaching an outcome,” said David Waskow, international climate director at the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based environmental think tank. The latest draft also “requests” nations to return every year to strengthen their emissions-cutting targets until the 1.5 degree Celsius goal is within reach. In diplomatic terms, that is tamer than “urges,” which was used in the previous draft. Even at current temperatures, Mr. Chowdhury said, “we see the destruction, the devastation, the pain, the suffering that all countries of the world are facing.” Mr. Chowdhury is from Bangladesh, one of the nations that have suffered most from climate change. He received sustained applause from delegates in the plenary hall. The latest draft calls on countries to accelerate “the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels.” Unabated coal refers to power plants that do not capture their carbon dioxide emissions using a nascent technology not currently available on a commercial scale. The language would allow power plants with the technology to continue burning coal, and is a change from previous language asking nations to “accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels.” John Kerry, the United States special envoy for climate change, on Friday described fossil fuel subsidies as the “definition of insanity,” denouncing measures taken by governments that artificially lower the price of coal, oil or gas. ADVERTISEMENT The world spends about $423 billion each year to subsidize oil, gas and coal, about four times the amount needed to help poor countries address climate change, according to the U.N. Development Program. Officials from other countries argued that the words “unabated” and “inefficient” should be removed from the agreement. “We need clear language on the need to eliminate all fossil fuel subsidies, not only the inefficient ones, and to accelerate the phaseout of coal power,” said Andrea Meza, Costa Rica’s environment minister. “Weasel words,” Catherine Abreu, executive director of Destination Zero, an environmental group, called them. Mr. Kerry defended the language about unabated coal, saying commercial carbon capture technology could be available in the future. It’s unclear whether the coal language will stay in the final version, considering that countries like China, India, Poland and the United States still rely heavily on coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel. ADVERTISEMENT In the negotiations Friday night, diplomats were wrestling over how to write regulations to govern the fast-growing global market in carbon offsets, in which one company or country compensates for its own emissions by paying someone else to reduce theirs. One of the thorniest technical issues is how to properly account for these global trades so that any reductions in emissions aren’t overestimated or double-counted, and negotiators still haven’t resolved debates over how best to do so. It is common for United Nations climate conferences, which are supposed to run for two weeks, to go into overtime. Diplomats often don’t get down to the nitty-gritty details until the final night. Lia Nicholson, who represents small island nations in the negotiations, said the group “finds ourselves at the final hours of this conference overwhelmed at the work still ahead of us.” "
" John Kerry, the U.S. special envoy for climate change, on Friday described fossil fuel subsidies as the “definition of insanity,” denouncing measures taken by governments that artificially lower the price of coal, oil or gas. Speaking at the United Nations climate summit, where negotiators for nearly 200 nations are trying to seek agreement on a deal that averts the worst effects of climate change, Mr. Kerry called for rapidly phasing out the subsidies. But he defended new language in a draft of an agreement that appears to have watered down a push to curb fossil fuels. A version released early Friday called on countries to accelerate “the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels.” The addition of the words unabated and inefficient was seen by some environmental groups as a loophole that would allow subsidies to continue. But Mr. Kerry argued that the wording “must stay” in the final agreement because commercial technology to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions could be developed in the future. He said that “knowing what the evidence is” about how sharply global emissions needed to be cut, countries cannot rule out the use of new technologies. ADVERTISEMENT He spoke forcefully about ending fossil fuel subsidies broadly. The U.N. Development Program recently calculated that the world spends $423 billion each year to subsidize oil, gas and coal, about four times the amount needed to help poor countries address climate change. “That’s a definition of insanity,” Mr. Kerry said, adding that underwriting oil, gas and coal allowed governments “to feed the problem we’re here to cure. It doesn’t make sense.” Officials from other countries argued that the words unabated and inefficient should be removed from the agreement. “We need clear language on the need to eliminate all fossil fuel subsidies, not only the inefficient ones, and to accelerate the phaseout of coal power,” said Andrea Meza, Costa Rica’s environment minister. Tina Stege, the climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, a South Pacific nation threatened by rising sea levels, said, “Fossil fuel subsidies are paying for our own destruction.”"
" When a massive wildfire swept through Paradise, Calif., three years ago this week, it killed 85 people and destroyed more than 13,000 homes. The wood chalet-style cabin where Mike and Jennifer Petersen lived — built by Ms. Petersen’s grandparents in the 1960s — was one of those homes. “I don’t even have a good enough vocabulary to describe what that day was like,” said Mr. Petersen, who remembers driving through the fire to escape, with Ms. Petersen and their sons, who were 18 and 21. “It was nuts.” The Petersens are now rebuilding on the same site — but not the way Ms. Petersen’s grandparents built. They’re putting up a Q Cabin, a 1,400-square-foot structure made from a half-circle of noncombustible steel. From the outside, the house, which cost just under $350,000, looks a little like a small, smartly designed airplane hangar. Inside, it’s an open-plan contemporary home. Mr. Petersen, who manages a hardware store, one of the few surviving businesses in town, said he wanted to build a house that was both stylish and solid. “If there is going to be something that could survive a fire,” he said, “this would be it.” ADVERTISEMENT The Petersens are not alone in their desire for a disaster-proof home. In natural-disaster-prone areas across the United States, homeowners are building houses designed to withstand a multitude of possible calamities. And while some of the technologies are experimental, they offer a glimpse of the future of construction in large swaths of the country, as climate change ushers in an era of more frequent wildfires, storms and floods. As much as a third of the housing stock in the United States — some 35 million houses — is at high risk from natural disasters related to climate change, according to information from CoreLogic, the real estate data analytics company. “These perils have always been there,” said Tom Larsen, a CoreLogic principal who does risk modeling. “But every time there’s a catastrophe that gets closer, people get that feeling of, ‘Wow, that could be me.’” And climate-related catastrophes will likely get worse. CoreLogic predicts that 30 years from now, a typical strong coastal storm in Florida could flood 300,000 homes, more than triple the number affected today. ADVERTISEMENT Vern Sneed, a general contractor and the founder of Design Horizons, the company that makes Q Cabins, said he initially became interested in this type of building — inspired by the Quonset huts manufactured during World War II to hold military supplies — because it could be constructed quickly and cheaply. (Although that has changed recently, with labor shortages and material costs rising.) He also liked the unusual shape, which made Q Cabins stand out among other prefabricated homes when he started marketing them in 2010. Later, he realized that because the houses he was selling were almost entirely steel, they were fire resistant. So he added noncombustible sheathing, which he said makes the structures’ main materials noncombustible, in theory, up to 2,600 degrees. (In certain scenarios, he said, they could still burn, and none of the Q Cabins have been tested in real wildfires.) After the 2018 fire, Mr. Sneed moved his company to Chico, about 20 minutes from Paradise, to sell the factory-built Q Cabin kits to people rebuilding. He has sold a handful in the area, he said, from small storage sheds to a 6,000-square-foot house, and about a dozen more are in the works, including one that Missy Barnard and her husband, David Barnard, are building. A former emergency room director, Ms. Barnard said they scrapped their plans to replace their 1970s ranch-style home with a conventional house when she discovered the Q Cabin. “It’s cool as hell,” she said. “And it’s modern, and it’s noncombustible.” The Barnards are building it themselves, for the most part, working six or seven days a week, which has been challenging. But once it’s done, Ms. Barnard said, “I’m not leaving this house ever again.” Others are looking further into the past than World War II for solutions — a lot further. Michele Barbato, a professor of structural engineering in the department of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California at Davis, is studying compressed earth block construction, a 10,000-year-old technique for making bricks from tightly compacted dirt and mud, mixed with cement, limestone or a chemical stabilizer to make it water-resistant. ADVERTISEMENT Testing in Dr. Barbato’s lab has showed that earth-block homes are fire-, hurricane- and wind-resistant, he said. But the best evidence, he added, may be in structures that have survived for thousands of years, like the Great Wall of China: “We can build the same type of structures today.” Glenn Kelman, the chief executive of Redfin, the Seattle-based real estate brokerage, has invested in the technology because he thinks it’s a promising solution in a time of climate change. “People don’t change unless they have to,” he said. “We’re at the point where people have to.” And homeowners like Will and Michelle Phinizy are giving it a try. Their previous house, a traditional wood-frame structure in a rural area outside Lubbock, Texas, was destroyed in a fire in 2019. “We watched it burn,” Mr. Phinizy said. “It was just a crumpled metal roof on the ground when the sun came up.” They hope that their new home — a 2,200-square-foot Tuscan ranch-style dwelling that they have almost finished building — will be fire-resistant, sustainable and sturdier. And there’s a bonus: The building material was readily available on their property. “We just dug up dirt,” Mr. Phinizy said, and then mixed it with 7 percent cement, turning it into 25,000 earth blocks. ADVERTISEMENT Ryan Runge, the president of Advanced Earthen Construction Technologies, who sold the couple their block-making machine, said the blocks are mold-proof and, when reinforced with rebar, earthquake-resistant. The walls are so thick that they retain heat in winter and remain cool enough in summer that air-conditioning isn’t necessary, at least on the first floor. “It’s like living in a cave,” Mr. Runge said. But there’s a downside: Compressed earth block homes are labor-intensive to build and may not be any cheaper than wood-frame houses. The Phinizys’ home will cost a little over $150 a square foot — roughly in line with the estimates they got to build a conventional home. As Mr. Phinizy put it: “It’s not all dirt cheap, so to speak.” Earth blocks also weigh up to 40 pounds each, Mr. Runge said, which makes them difficult to transport in large quantities. Because of the high labor costs and low material cost, this construction method is more widely used in disaster-prone places like Haiti and Mexico, where labor is less expensive than in the United States, and on higher-end homes, whose owners can afford to pay more for labor and hire pricey structural engineers to help with the additional permitting. (Local building codes don’t usually account for earth-block construction, so a structural engineer has to sign off on these projects.) But while it’s still a niche market — there are maybe a couple hundred earth-block homes in the United States — Mr. Runge said he has seen demand grow in the past year or so, as lumber costs have increased and natural disasters have taken a toll on housing. For the first three years that he owned the company, Mr. Runge said he had about one house under construction every year. But this year, his fourth, there are five homes in the works. “We’re selling them faster than we can make them now,” he said of the earth-block-making machines. On the waterfront in Florida, Gene and Tammy Tener are confronting a different kind of challenge. The Teners bought a house in Crystal River in 2010, because of the area’s natural beauty. “We’ve got manatees that come right up to our dock, and dolphins that come up to the sea wall,” said Mr. Tener, a mechanical engineer. “For me, it was a dream come true.” ADVERTISEMENT Less dreamy: the area’s frequent storms and floods. When they bought the house, they noticed a water line on the curtains and the walls — a visible reminder of just how high the floodwaters had risen in the past. The couple repainted and used the home as a weekend retreat for a while. But a few years ago, they decided it was time to tear it down and build a place where they could live full time. They enlisted Deltec Homes, a North Carolina-based business that builds hurricane- and flood-resistant homes that it advertises as withstanding winds of up to 190 miles an hour. The Teners liked the curvilinear shape of the Deltec homes, which the company says helps the structures offset wind pressure by 30 percent. The house they built — an 18-sided, three-story structure with 180-degree views, 3,200-square-feet of living space and a garage — cost about $750,000. “When the inspectors came, they said, ‘If we have a hurricane, I want to come here,’” said Ms. Tener, who works in early childhood education. Deltec didn’t set out to build storm-resistant houses, said Steve Linton, the company’s president. In the 1960s, the company sold vacation rental properties that had a rounded shape to maximize views. But over time, clients began to notice that their dwellings fared better during strong storms and hurricanes than their neighbors’ did. By the 1990s, the company had redesigned them to withstand stronger winds and was marketing them as storm-resistant. Since the company was founded in 1968, it has built more than 5,000 homes. And last year, Mr. Linton said, new orders were up 44 percent over the previous year. In part, that can be attributed to pandemic-related relocations, he said, but it’s also part of “a greater realization of climate change, and that we need to prepare our homes for future storms that have increasing intensity.” Deltec is now working to develop homes that can withstand winds of up to 225 miles an hour. “The big picture is we’ve got to prepare ourselves for a future we might not understand yet,” Mr. Linton said. ADVERTISEMENT According to the National Association of Home Builders, while most new homes are built to standards requiring them to be resistant to earthquakes, floods, blizzards, hurricanes and wildfires, the vast majority of homes in the United States — about 80 percent — were built before the 2000 International Residential Code and may need improvements to make them safer. But aesthetics and cost remain the major factors driving many homeowners’ design decisions, rather than the threat of future disasters. Nicole C. Close, the owner of a medical research company, said that when she and her husband, Chris Albrecht, were building a home in Kitty Hawk, on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, her top priorities were the look and feel of the house. Mr. Albrecht, who owns a generator company, wanted to make sure it could withstand hurricanes and storms. “I didn’t want to live in a storm-resistant home and have it be ugly,” Ms. Close said. “I’m all about design and aesthetics.” The compromise? The couple built a two-story, 4,800-square-foot Deltec house with a large kitchen that seats 10 people at the bar. It also has a game room with a shuffleboard, a poker table and a home theater. Since they moved into the home in 2019, they have had a couple of big storms and a Category 1 hurricane that knocked out the power and required their generator to run for three days. “We saw things flying in the air like canoes,” Ms. Close said. “But we really felt safe and protected.” For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

" Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together. The United Nations climate change conference known as COP26 officially comes to an end on Friday, as nearly 200 nations try to finalize an agreement to tackle global warming. World leaders, climate experts and activists gathered in Glasgow to galvanize countries into preventing the average global temperature from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. COP26 is the 10th climate conference Lisa Friedman, a reporter on our Climate desk, has covered. It is the first for Lyndsey Layton, the desk’s deputy editor. In separate interviews, they discussed lost luggage, The Times’s approach to coverage, and why, despite some criticism, summits such as COP26 are important for making change. Their answers have been edited and condensed. When did you arrive at the conference?
LISA FRIEDMAN I arrived on Saturday, Oct. 30. My luggage arrived the next night — my flight was delayed, and while we all made our connecting flight to Glasgow, none of our luggage did. I leave on Nov. 14, the Sunday after the conference is supposed to officially close. After 10 times covering this, I know that it sometimes goes into many, many hours of overtime, so I wanted to give myself a little breathing room to do stories and tell readers what it all came to and meant. Is the conference different from what you were expecting?
LYNDSEY LAYTON I didn’t really quite know what to expect. This may sound obvious, but it’s one thing to have edited so many stories about the global nature of climate change. It’s another to come to a place like this and hear all these languages. People have come from all over the planet, concerned about this problem and are working on it and trying to find a way forward.

What is different about COP26 compared with conferences that you’ve covered in the past?
FRIEDMAN The most important one to compare this to is in 2015, when countries signed the Paris Agreement. There, you had the head of the United Nations climate body and lawmakers marching with activists down the streets of Paris and New York ahead of the conference, promising to work together to form an agreement. Since then, we have seen countries not really live up to what they promised. There’s a lot more anger and frustration from developing countries and from environmental activists that the moment is not being met. I’d say that there’s a lot more pressure on countries to not just make promises, but to show that they’re really acting. ADVERTISEMENT What’s the energy like at the conference?
LAYTON I’ve had some really interesting conversations. To give you a sense of the variety of issues: I spoke with a Scottish member of Parliament who comes from an old coal mining town, and the coal mine is shut down. His people are struggling. I asked, “What do they think of climate change?” And he said, “They don’t care.” He said, “Climate change is a middle-class issue. My people are worried about food on the table, a roof over their heads and a way to make a living.” That dilemma is something that is in West Virginia, too. If this country transitions to green energy, there will be displacement. There will be people and communities that are going to suffer. The question is, how do you prop those up? How do you bring in new employment, new activity? It’s so interesting to be able to meet people here who are experiencing the challenges and the impacts of climate change in different ways. What kinds of precautions did you take against Covid-19?
FRIEDMAN Our team had a number of calls on safety protocol before we came. We all came armed with masks and hand sanitizer. Once here, the protocol is supposed to be that you take a rapid test and you register your results with the National Health Service and you can only get in once you show negative results. That adds a logistical layer getting in. Inside, everything is pretty distant and spaced and people are wearing masks in the hallway, but it’s also a conference of more than 30,000 people doing work, so masks come off and there are scrums. There are still risks. There have been reports of people testing positive. Both the United Nations climate body and the British presidency of the conference had been really not transparent at all about cases. As journalists, we all find it really troubling, the lack of transparency about the numbers. That’s been an issue here. How does the collective focus on shared goals make you feel?
LAYTON There are so many issues; it’s such a complex problem. And every nation that comes has its own set of particular issues and concerns and its own internal politics. Like the United States — we’re very divided over climate policy, as are so many other nations. There’s so much to discuss and these little conversations are happening between negotiators in rooms that we can’t access. You don’t really have eyes into the real meat of the discussions; you’re just trying to follow the bouncing ball and trying to pick up intel here and there. It’s very hard to get the overall view of what’s really happening. That’s the challenge that our reporters have. How do you create coverage that really stands out?
LAYTON We started planning for this way in advance, months and months and months ago, to figure out what would be the emerging themes. We started thinking about this a long time ago and Hannah Fairfield, the Climate editor, has been super organized. We had a game plan coming into COP26. We had a number of stories that we published before we even got to Scotland. Then we had a plan going in for stories we wanted to do here in addition to whatever news we could break. ADVERTISEMENT There’s a question circulating online on whether the summit is effective. Is that refrain hitting the summit?
FRIEDMAN I have seen some of that. But, no summit, no conference, can solve everything. These conferences are forcing moments. Countries and leaders are put on the spot and they have to commit to things. And then they are on the record committing to these things and we can see whether they make good on their pledges or not. As problematic as some of the charges are, without these big summits, without the eyes of the world on leaders, you wouldn’t get new commitments."

" GLASGOW — Vanessa Nakate, a climate activist from Uganda, told the United Nations climate summit on Thursday that she and her peers did not believe the pledges that ministers, corporations and banks made this week to move aggressively on climate change. But they want to. “I’m actually here to beg you to prove us wrong,” Ms. Nakate said. “God help us all if you fail to prove us wrong.” In one of the most powerful speeches to date before the U.N. climate summit, Ms. Nakate, 24, told diplomats that leaders already are trying to brand the conference, known as COP26, a success, but that she and her peers weren’t buying it. “Let us be honest,” she said. “We have been here before.” After a quarter of a century of climate conferences and new annual commitments, planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. “This year will be no different,” Ms. Nakate said. ADVERTISEMENT “We are drowning in promises,” she said. “Commitments,” Ms. Nakate said, “will not reduce CO2. Promises will not stop the suffering of the people. Pledges will not stop the planet from warming. Only immediate and drastic action will pull us back from the abyss.” She called out business leaders and investors, saying they had not taken immediate action but instead were “flying into COP on private jets” and “making fancy speeches.” She also questioned the presence of those in the fossil fuel industry. “I hope you can appreciate that we may be skeptical when the largest delegation here at the COP26 climate summit does not belong to a country,” she said, “but instead belongs to the fossil fuel industry.” And she had a message for those bearing promises: “Show us your trustworthiness. Show us your honesty. I am here to say: Prove us wrong.” Ms. Nakate, a rising star among the world’s climate activists, received sustained applause after her speech. She first drew widespread attention in January 2020 when The Associated Press cropped her out of a picture at the World Economic Forum. She had been standing next to four white activists, including the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. ADVERTISEMENT The omission shocked and saddened Ms. Nakate, who in a tearful 10-minute video posted on Twitter denounced the “racism” in the global environmental movement and the erasure of Black and African voices. Her response reverberated around the world and solidified her place as a leading voice among young Africans passionately arguing for action against climate change."

" GLASGOW —- For as long as there have been international climate talks, Saleemul Huq, a botanist from Bangladesh, has quietly counseled diplomats and activists on the prickliest question: What is owed to countries least responsible for the problem of global warming but most harmed by its effects — and by whom? Year after year, calls have steadily grown louder for industrialized nations responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions already heating up the planet to own up to the problem — and pay for the damage. This year, demands for redress have sharpened as climate justice has become a rallying cry, not just from countries in the global south, like Mr. Huq’s, but from a broad range of activists, especially young people, in the United States and Europe. They have peaked in Glasgow: As negotiations close this week, a major point of contention between rich and poor countries is whether the final summit document will acknowledge the need for a separate pool of money to address historic harms. Known by sterile code words crafted to avoid blame, “loss and damage,” that fund would be separate from money to help poor countries adapt to a changing climate, its proponents have argued. Loss and damage is a matter of historic responsibility and would pay for irreparable losses, such as the disappearance of national territory, culture and ecosystems, they said. ADVERTISEMENT “The term ‘loss and damage’ is a euphemism for terms we’re not allowed to use, which are ‘liability and compensation,’” Mr. Huq said. “‘Reparations’ is even worse.” The United States, which is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases historically, has long been cool to the idea. But in Glasgow, it signed a statement agreeing to “increase resources” for loss and damage, without committing to anything more specific. The U.S. climate envoy, John Kerry, said Thursday that any agreement on loss and damage would have to shield countries from legal claims. “We’re going to work hard to deal with that issue over here,” he said. In the real world, beyond the windowless chambers where negotiators are arguing over the words of the final document, three factors have made it harder to ignore the demands for loss and damage money. Courts around the world are already hearing liability cases against governments and fossil fuel companies, and in some cases ruling against those governments and companies for the damages they have already caused. Second, it has become impossible for leaders of wealthy countries to ignore big ticket losses and damages when extreme weather events exacerbated by rising temperatures are taking a toll in their own countries, including record wildfires this year in California and floods in Germany. ADVERTISEMENT “We have entered what I call the era of loss and damage,” Mr. Huq said. Perhaps most importantly, Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, broke something of a taboo among rich countries. She said Scotland would devote 2 million pounds, about $2.8 million, to address what it called “structural inequalities.” “Finance is key to this not as an act of charity but as an act of reparation,” she said Thursday at the summit. She called on rich countries to “start to pay their debt to the developing countries around the world. It is no longer any excuse for not doing so.” Mr. Huq called Ms. Sturgeon’s announcement a vital diplomatic nudge. Scotland, after all, describes itself as the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, a center of shipbuilding and heavy industry, which profited handsomely from British colonialism and the African slave trade before that. Scotland’s pledge is “not for charity, not for helping poor people, but taking responsibility and paying a debt to the people who are going to be affected,” Mr. Huq said. “She’s looking for a coalition of the willing.” The latest draft statement from the summit, released early Wednesday, says very little about loss and damage except to cite the “urgency of scaling up action and support, including finance” for loss and damage. It says nothing specific about setting up a separate funding stream, nor how much. This led a bloc of island nations to say that emerging economies would not put forth more ambitious emissions reductions targets, “if we don’t scale up the provision of finance, and this includes the long overdue recognition of a separate and additional component for loss and damage.” ADVERTISEMENT A vigorous fight on the issue is expected in the closing hours of the summit.    Mr. Huq, now 69, sat with a can of Irn-bru, the Scottish soda, in his hand under a giant inflated globe in a large auditorium known here as the Action Zone one day this week. A steady stream of people came to consult and talk. At one point, a 10-foot-tall puppet, named Little Amal, walked through the room, to which Mr. Huq appeared oblivious. This is what he likes to do at every summit — plant himself in one spot and have people pay him a visit, he said. He has come to each one since the first climate change convention was negotiated in Rio in 1992. Loss and damage was first championed by countries in the Pacific Ocean, and then embraced by a widening group of developing world countries. All the while, the real losses and damages kept piling up. Storms washed away crops. Droughts turned farmland to desert. Scientists got better at pinpointing the role of the warming planet in extreme weather. As negotiators met at the climate summit in 2013 in Warsaw, Super Typhoon Haiyan wiped away homes and farms and killed more than 6,000 people in Southeast Asia. Loss and damage was acknowledged in the 2015 Paris accord, the agreement among nations to jointly work to limit global warming, but not before the United States included specific language ruling out the prospect of liability and compensation. The United Nations commissioned reports. A glossary was written to define all the ways that countries were facing irreparable harms, like the loss of territory that requires people to pack up and move or the inundation of vast swaths of farmland that cannot be recovered. A breakthrough came at the Madrid climate summit in 2019: an agreement to set up a technical assistance program. So far that consists of a website but no staff or funding. Yamide Dagnet, who follows climate negotiations at the World Resources Institute, called that “insufficient.” A few months later, Mr. Huq’s country was pummeled by Cyclone Amphan. The country’s early warning system succeeded in getting millions of people out of harm’s way. But a year later, Mr. Huq said, researchers from the International Center for Climate Change & Development, where he is the director, found that thousands of people had migrated to Dhaka after the storm leveled their homes. “This is loss and damage to the livelihoods of the people,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT The cyclone was intensified by warmer ocean temperatures, a telltale sign of the effects of climate change. Estimates of the amount of money required to address loss and damage varies widely, from roughly $300 to $600 billion a year by 2030. At the moment, rich countries have failed to shore up the $100 billion they promised to deliver annually by 2020. That aid is designed to help countries adapt to climate change; it doesn’t include funds to address permanent damage. This week, negotiators from developing countries working on language around loss and damage said their counterparts from wealthy nations had not yet agreed to include any specific reference to a separate fund for loss and damage. “We will make them change their mind,” Mr. Huq maintained. And so the battle now is over whether the final text will endorse the principle of a separate fund to address loss and damage. There’s additional scrutiny on the United States, in part because of its outsized role as history’s biggest polluter, but also because of the stated commitments of the Biden administration to climate justice. That led Rev. Lennox Yearwood, an American climate justice activist who was sitting at a table near Mr. Huq, to credit the Biden administration for putting “environmental justice at the center” of its climate policies, in the wake of the broader movement for racial justice in 2020 after the death of George Floyd and others. But that was hardly sufficient, Rev. Yearwood said. ADVERTISEMENT “I would love for our country to be not the one going in kicking and screaming to the altar, so to speak,” he said. “I’d love for our country to be the country that leads on this and compels other countries to say we are complicit in this process, we have caused damage specifically to the global south and we want to ensure they are repaired.” Mr. Huq, for his part, is optimistic that the rich world will get dragged to the altar this year and commit to setting up a loss and damage fund, even without committing to any specific amount of money. That, he said, would give developing countries a chance to put the fund at the center of the agenda at the 2022 summit, to be held in the Egyptian resort city of Sharm El Sheikh. “I’m hopeful,” he said. “What we need in Glasgow is to plant a seed that we can then water for the next 12 months and make it bloom in COP 27 in Egypt.” Lisa Friedman contributed reporting."
" GLASGOW — In Gaelic, “Glasgow” translates to “dear green place,” a nod to the parks, gardens and flourishing green spaces throughout the city. But according to Chris Mitchell, who was a garbage collector there for more than two decades, the only thing flourishing in Glasgow these days is “a mountain of waste.” As diplomats at the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow this week preach about the need to curb both greenhouse gas emissions and mass consumption to protect the planet, the reality of today’s throwaway society can be seen just a short way from the conference’s doorstep. Outside the gleaming center of Scotland’s largest city, dumpsters and trash cans are overflowing. The city’s rat population has surged, with four garbage workers hospitalized because of attacks over the past five months. And litter is strewn across streets. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Mitchell, a senior official for the GMB Scotland trade union, which represents the city’s 1,000 garbage collectors among other workers, said they staged an eight-day strike that ended on Monday because they were tired of poor working conditions, lack of respect from management and low wages. It is a cry that has been echoed throughout Britain, the United States and other parts of the world, where essential workers who carried communities through the worst of the pandemic are saying they will no longer stand for being overworked and underpaid. “We kept people safe,” said Mr. Mitchell, 45, who started working as a garbage collector when he was 16. “We cared for the most vulnerable. We cared for the elderly.” He appreciated the nightly clap for key workers during the pandemic. But now that coronavirus cases have subsided from peak levels, he feels the government has “abandoned low paid workers who have saved this nation.” In parts of the city, trash is now collected only once every three weeks, down from once every two weeks about a year ago. That means garbage collectors, many of whom make less than 20,000 British pounds ($27,000) a year, have to carry heavier loads up and down steps. On top of the less frequent collections, volumes of trash per household climbed over the past two years, a reflection of increased spending on takeout and online deliveries, according to Mr. Mitchell. “The pandemic has created waste upon waste upon waste,” he said. The city of about 635,000 has urged residents to reduce their waste to help protect the environment, but garbage collectors like Jack McGowan, 26, say that reducing collections is not an effective way to achieve that. ADVERTISEMENT “The bins are always like that,” he said on Wednesday, gesturing to several overflowing dumpsters behind a block of apartments in Scotstoun, an area west of the Glasgow city center. “We need better pay. Respect as well.” Mr. McGowan said he lives with his mother because he cannot afford a mortgage on his salary of £19,000 a year. He said he had already seen four rats jump out of trash cans that morning alone. Glasgow promotes its recycling program and efforts to become more environmentally friendly. But Mr. McGowan said he saw examples every day of people putting nonrecyclable trash in recycling bins. Garbage collectors said they were likely to strike again in the run-up to Christmas if they do not get pay increases. In a statement, the Glasgow City Council said that the leader of the council had already had extensive conversations with the union and that the “door remains open to all trade union colleagues.” Fiona Ross, a council spokeswoman, said she could not go into further detail because talks were continuing. ADVERTISEMENT Meanwhile, the delegates inside the COP26 summit in Glasgow say they are making some progress toward an agreement to avert catastrophic levels of climate change. On Wednesday, the United States and China issued a joint statement in which they pledged to do more to cut emissions this decade and in which China committed for the first time to address emissions from methane. Separately, the United Nations climate agency released a draft of an accord that urged nations “to accelerate the phasing out” of greenhouse gas emissions. But outside the climate talks, there is a mounting frustration over the disconnect between policymakers and those most affected by climate change. There have been daily protests organized by youth activists, who say that pledges by countries that they will commit to goals that are decades away is not enough. “Nobody really wants to incur the cost of preventing climate change today,” said Sayantan Ghosal, an economics professor at the University of Glasgow’s business school. “They’re willing to do it tomorrow, but they’re not willing to do it today.” There has also been a gap between world leaders and business executives on the one hand, who have talked this week about the urgent need for a transition to clean energy, and the working class people on the other who will be most affected by the rising costs associated with that transition. Many of the lowest paid workers in society, including garbage collectors, are more worried about increasing prices of food, rent and energy than about increasing temperatures. They often do not have the flexibility to spend more on food and clothing that are more sustainable. ADVERTISEMENT As the U.S. economy picks up again, after a lull during the pandemic, people are quitting their jobs in record numbers, according to data from the U.S. Department of Labor. There are five million fewer people working than before the pandemic began, and employers have struggled to find enough health care workers, waiters, truck drivers and butchers. This has given employees newfound leverage and power. The number of workers on strike in the United States increased in October to more than 25,000, versus an average of about 10,000 in the previous three months, according to data collected by the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University. The shortages have disrupted Britain, which has struggled to find workers to make up for the thousands of European workers who left in five years since Britain voted to leave the European Union. Mr. Mitchell, the senior union official, said that 20 drivers had left the garbage collection team in recent weeks for other truck driving jobs that are offering better pay. Peter Welsh, a union spokesman, said Scotland needed to invest in the workers who will help deliver a transition to a greener economy. “There are huge, huge challenges that I don’t quite think mainstream politics have begun to grasp and understand,” he said."
" GLASGOW, Escocia— En gaélico, “Glasgow” se traduce como “querido lugar verde”. Es un guiño a los parques, jardines y florecientes espacios verdes que están por toda la ciudad. Pero según Chris Mitchell, quien fue recolector de basura allí durante más de dos décadas, lo único que está floreciendo en Glasgow por estos días es “una montaña de basura”. Mientras los diplomáticos en la cumbre climática de la ONU en Glasgow predicaban esta semana sobre la necesidad de reducir tanto las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero como el consumo masivo para proteger el planeta, la realidad de la sociedad de consumo actual se podía percibir a poca distancia de la entrada de la conferencia. Fuera del reluciente centro de la ciudad más grande de Escocia, los contenedores y botes de basura están desbordados. La población de ratas de la ciudad ha aumentado: cuatro trabajadores del servicio de recolección de basura han sido hospitalizados en los últimos cinco meses por ataques de roedores. La basura está desparramada por las calles. ADVERTISEMENT Mitchell, un alto funcionario del sindicato GMB de Escocia, que representa a los mil recolectores de basura de la ciudad, entre otros trabajadores, dijo que habían organizado una huelga de ocho días que terminó el lunes porque estaban hartos de las malas condiciones laborales, la falta de respeto de la gerencia y los bajos salarios. Ese reclamo se ha repetido en todo el Reino Unido, Estados Unidos y otras partes del mundo: los trabajadores esenciales que cargaron con las comunidades durante los peores momentos de la pandemia afirman que ya no van a tolerar que los exploten y les paguen poco. “Mantuvimos a la gente a salvo”, dijo Mitchell, de 45 años, quien comenzó a trabajar como recolector de basura cuando tenía 16. “Cuidamos a los más vulnerables. Protegimos a los ancianos”. Mitchell agradeció el gesto de los aplausos nocturnos dedicados a los trabajadores esenciales durante la pandemia. Pero ahora que los casos de coronavirus han disminuido, siente que el gobierno ha “abandonado a los trabajadores mal pagados que han salvado a esta nación”. En algunas partes de la ciudad, la basura ahora se recolecta solo una vez cada tres semanas. Hace aproximadamente un año, se recolectaba una vez cada dos semanas. Eso significa que los recolectores de basura, muchos de los cuales ganan menos de 20.000 libras esterlinas (27.000 dólares) al año, tienen que subir y bajar cargas más pesadas. Además de las recolecciones menos frecuentes, el volumen de basura por hogar aumentó en los últimos dos años. Es un reflejo del aumento del gasto en comida para llevar y entregas de compras y pedidos hechos en línea, según Mitchell. ADVERTISEMENT “La pandemia ha creado desechos y más desechos”, dijo. La ciudad de aproximadamente 635.000 habitantes les ha pedido a los residentes reducir sus desechos para ayudar a proteger el medioambiente, pero los recolectores de basura como Jack McGowan, de 26 años, dicen que reducir las recolecciones no es una manera efectiva de lograrlo. “Los contenedores siempre están así”, dijo el miércoles, mientras señalaba varios contenedores de basura desbordados detrás de un conjunto de apartamentos en Scotstoun, una zona al oeste del centro de la ciudad de Glasgow. “Necesitamos que nos paguen mejor. Y también respeto”. McGowan dijo que vive con su madre porque no puede pagar una hipoteca con su salario de 19.000 libras al año. Además, aseguró que ya había visto a cuatro ratas saltar de los botes de basura esa misma mañana. Glasgow promueve sus iniciativas y programas de reciclaje para ser más amigable con el medioambiente. Pero McGowan dijo que todos los días veía a personas que arrojaban basura no reciclable en los contenedores para reciclar. Los recolectores de basura afirmaron que lo más probable es que vuelvan a entrar en huelga durante el período previo a Navidad si no reciben aumentos salariales. A través de un comunicado, el Consejo del Ayuntaminto de Glasgow dijo que su autoridad mayor ya había tenido extensas conversaciones con el sindicato y que “la puerta sigue abierta para todos los compañeros sindicales”. ADVERTISEMENT Fiona Ross, una portavoz del Ayuntamiento, dijo que no podía dar muchos detalles porque las conversaciones seguían en proceso. Mientras tanto, los delegados dentro de la cumbre COP 26 en Glasgow dijeron que estaban logrando algunos avances hacia un acuerdo para evitar niveles catastróficos en el cambio climático. El miércoles, Estados Unidos y China emitieron una declaración conjunta en la que se comprometieron a hacer más para reducir las emisiones esta década y en la que China se comprometió por primera vez a abordar las emisiones de metano. Por otra parte, la agencia climática de las Naciones Unidas publicó un borrador de un acuerdo que instaba a las naciones a “acelerar la eliminación gradual” de las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero. Pero fuera de las conversaciones sobre el clima, existe una frustración cada vez mayor por la desconexión entre los tomadores de decisión y los más afectados por el cambio climático. Ha habido protestas diarias organizadas por activistas jóvenes, quienes afirman que las promesas que hicieron los países de cumplir objetivos para dentro de varias décadas no es suficiente. “En realidad, nadie quiere incurrir en el costo de prevenir el cambio climático hoy”, dijo Sayantan Ghosal, profesor de economía en la facultad de comercio de la Universidad de Glasgow. “Están dispuestos a hacerlo mañana, pero no hoy”. También ha habido una brecha entre, por un lado, los líderes mundiales y los ejecutivos de empresas que han conversado esta semana sobre la necesidad urgente de una transición a las energías limpias, y por el otro, la clase trabajadora que se verá más afectada por el aumento de los costos asociados con esa transición. ADVERTISEMENT Muchos de los trabajadores peor pagados de la sociedad, incluidos los recolectores de basura, están más preocupados por el incremento de los precios de los alimentos, el alquiler y la energía eléctrica que por el aumento de las temperaturas. Por lo general no tienen la flexibilidad para gastar más en alimentos y ropa que sean más sustentables. A medida que la economía estadounidense se recupera, después de una pausa durante la pandemia, la gente está dejando sus trabajos en cifras récord, según datos del Departamento de Trabajo de Estados Unidos. Hay cinco millones menos de personas trabajando que antes de que comenzara la pandemia, y los empresarios han tenido dificultades para encontrar suficientes trabajadores de la salud, meseros, camioneros y carniceros. Esto ha dado a los empleados una nueva influencia y poder. El número de trabajadores en huelga en Estados Unidos aumentó en octubre a más de 25.000, frente a una media de unos 10.000 en los tres meses anteriores, según datos recogidos por la Escuela de Relaciones Industriales y Laborales de la Universidad de Cornell. La escasez ha perturbado a Reino Unido, que ha tenido dificultades para encontrar obreros qu suplan a los miles de trabajadores europeos que se marcharon en los cinco años desde que el país votó a favor de abandonar la Unión Europea. Mitchell, el líder sindical, dijo que 20 conductores habían dejado el equipo de recolección de basura en las últimas semanas para ir a trabajar como choferes de camiones en puestos con mejores salarios. ADVERTISEMENT Peter Welsh, portavoz del sindicato, dijo que Escocia necesitaba invertir en los trabajadores que ayudarán a lograr la transición hacia una economía más verde. “Creo que hay enormes desafíos que los políticos no han ni comenzado a comprender”, dijo.

" Andrew’s reflections as host of this week’s DealBook summit, the 10th edition of the event as we celebrate DealBook’s 20th anniversary: After two days of interviews with some of the world’s top newsmakers, these are the moments that stood out to me. Tim Cook’s comments about his personal investment in cryptocurrency went viral, but what he said about how Apple engages with China was more instructive. We often write about the role of business in speaking out on policy issues. When do they take a public stand, versus when do they engage privately? It’s hard to do both, and Cook made the case for engagement. Critics will say he has no choice, given Apple’s extensive operations in the country. But I don’t doubt the sincerity of his belief in “world peace through world trade,” he said, quoting IBM’s Tom Watson. A day later, I asked Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, about how he thought companies should engage (or not) with China. “There are, I think, good-faith arguments in various directions,” America’s top diplomat said. I also pressed him on what the U.S. would do if China invaded Taiwan. The U.S. and other countries would “take action” to help Taiwan defend itself, he said. The big question is: What kind of action? Hearing Adam Neumann speak publicly for the first time in two years was quite something. Was he humbled? Sitting next to him, it seemed like he was, perhaps more than what came across onscreen. Of course, some will think that the former WeWork chief can never be contrite enough — and I think he understands that. To me, the most telling moment was when I asked him whether he planned to watch the TV series being produced about the company’s rise and fall. He said that Jared Leto, the actor playing him, “told me not to.” I sensed some sadness in the answer. Neumann may have more than $1 billion, but the cliché is true: Money doesn’t buy happiness. ADVERTISEMENT Meghan Markle and Mellody Hobson dropped some truths that often go unsaid. “The No. 1 beneficiary of diversity initiatives in this country has been white women,” Hobson said. On paid family leave, Markle said that “it takes strong men, modern men, to really understand they benefit from it as well.” And there was a “They’re Just Like Us” moment with the Duchess of Sussex: “I clipped coupons growing up,” she said. “I will never buy anything online without finding a promo code first.” Matthew McConaughey may or may not run for governor of Texas. And his comments about waiting to vaccinate his youngest kids made headlines. But I was struck by his Zen-like confidence, which he explained with an impassioned riff on the difference between joy and happiness. Joy, in his telling, should be the goal. Watch this to see what he means. I hope that next year many of you will be able to join us in person again, so we can experience this all together. But a hybrid approach that allows readers from across the globe to also join us virtually seems like the way forward. Inflation is surging. Consumer prices in October rose 6.2 percent year-over-year, the fastest pace in three decades. That has spooked business leaders and lawmakers, and may put more pressure on the Fed to react. ADVERTISEMENT China and the U.S. strike an unexpected climate pact. The world’s two biggest polluters said they would work together to reduce carbon emissions this decade, despite continuing trade tensions, although the announcement lacked many details. Evergrande averts default, again. The embattled Chinese property developer made $150 million in interest payments yesterday, just before crucial deadlines. Missing those would have prompted a default that could ripple through the Chinese economy, though other developers, like Kaisa, remain on the edge of insolvency. Rivian enjoys the biggest U.S. stock debut in years. The electric vehicle maker’s shares jumped 29 percent in their first day of trading, which valued Rivian at $86 billion — on par with G.M. It’s a sign that investors are betting Rivian can become the next Tesla. Elon Musk sells $5 billion worth of Tesla stock. In regulatory filings, the Tesla chief said he sold about 4.5 million shares, “solely” to cover taxes tied to stock options he has received. He still owns about 17 percent of Tesla, a stake worth about $180 billion. You can catch up on everything from the second and final day of the summit in our briefing from the day. Here are some of the highlights: Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned business leaders against sharing information and technology with their Chinese-owned partners. If Beijing wants intellectual property or information — anything, really, he said — “the state will get it.” ADVERTISEMENT He also called on governments, drug companies and others to “step up” vaccine distribution efforts around the world. Watch the full interview with Antony Blinken Ken Griffin of the financial giant Citadel said rapidly growing inflation was one of his biggest worries. He said that the Fed had been “far too generous” with stimulus, and he dismissed predictions that rising inflation would be temporary. “The theory that this is transitory is starting to get long in the tooth,” he said. Griffin also expressed skepticism about the promises made by supporters of cryptocurrency. “I worry that some of this passion has been misplaced when it comes to cryptocurrencies,” he said. Watch the full interview with Ken Griffin Mary Barra, G.M.’s chief, said that she wasn’t bothered by Tesla being worth 10 times more than her company, despite selling far fewer cars. Why? Because G.M.’s investments in electric vehicles would eventually bear fruit, she said: “General Motors is so undervalued as we start this wonderful period we’re in.” Barra said she currently drives a Chevy Volt, but that she was on the waiting list for an electrified version of something bigger. “I’m waiting for my Hummer,” she said. Watch the full interview with Mary Barra Darren Woods, Exxon Mobil’s chief, argued that his oil giant — long criticized for its role in climate change — can help the global economy transition to clean energy. Exxon can “bridge that gap between what’s needed today and what we want for tomorrow,” he said. A debate has emerged over whether rising energy prices are driven by moving too quickly away from fossil fuels or a cyclical phenomenon. Woods said both factors were at play. Watch the full interview with Darren Woods Dax Shepard, a host of the popular interview-based podcast “Armchair Expert,” said that he was against deplatforming, welcoming conversations with all, including those he disagreed with. “I think people’s bad ideas are best heard because that’s when you find out how bad their ideas are,” the actor and comedian said. But Monica Padman, his co-host, still has her guard up during tricky interviews. “We’re having very human conversations, and everyone can come off sympathetic,” she said. Watch the full interview with Dax Shepard and Monica Padman The journalist Maria Ressa, who won a Nobel Peace Prize this year for her work in the Philippines, has put her life and liberty at risk exposing government corruption. Her experience is a sign of what may lie ahead for the U.S. and other countries. “Our dystopia is coming for you,” she said. Ressa, who runs the digital media company Rappler, says the dangers she faces have been exacerbated by Facebook, which she says amplifies division and misinformation. The solution isn’t breaking up that company — others use similar algorithms — but stricter regulation. Watch the full interview with Maria Ressa The legal challenges to the Biden administration’s corporate vaccine mandate are piling up, giving businesses that oppose the rule an opportunity to delay — if not overturn — the rules. ADVERTISEMENT Several trade groups have sued to stop the mandate, including the American Trucking Associations, the National Retail Federation and National Federation of Independent Business. Although a federal appeals court has issued a temporary stay on the mandate, bringing a lawsuit gives these groups a way to formally elaborate their case. Just as noteworthy are the industry groups that aren’t joining these challenges, like the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Retail Industry Leaders Association. Let’s examine the different paths that two big retail groups are taking: The National Retail Federation signed on to a legal challenge to the mandate, arguing that compliance was “virtually impossible” and challenging OSHA’s authority to impose the rule. The group, which is led by Mike George of QVC’s parent, takes particular issue with putting the mandate in place during the crucial holiday season, even though the vaccinate-or-test deadline is Jan. 4. The Retail Industry Leaders Association, led by Ulta’s Mary Dillon, told DealBook that it had concerns about the mandate but that it was not suing. Instead, the group is helping its members prepare to adopt “the protocols necessary to follow the testing and vaccination requirements.” What might explain the split? While both groups count large companies as members, the Retail Industry Leaders Association does not represent any smaller companies, which are among the most concerned about the burden of carrying out the mandate. There’s also the risk of angering the White House, which may factor differently into groups’ stances.

" Pope Francis urged Scotland’s Catholics on Thursday to pray for a “fruitful outcome” as negotiators at the United Nations climate talks in Glasgow try to reach an agreement by week’s end. In a letter released by the Vatican, Francis said he regretted he could not attend the COP26 summit as previously planned, and asked for “God’s gifts of wisdom and strength” for the summit’s decision makers. “Time is running out,” Francis said. “This occasion must not be wasted, lest we have to face God’s judgment for our failure to be faithful stewards of the world he has entrusted to our care.” The summit, the pope said, was meant to address “one of the great moral issues of our time: the preservation of God’s creation, given to us as a garden to be cultivated and as a common home for our human family.” ADVERTISEMENT The Vatican said last month that the pope would not attend the summit and that its delegation to the talks would instead be headed by the secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin. Just before the summit, Francis urged global leaders to “take radical decisions” that would “provide effective responses to the present ecological crisis.” Since the beginning of his papacy in 2013, Francis has made it clear that environmental issues were important to him. He has noted that poor people suffer most as a result of ecological problems brought about by economic models, industrial systems and policies that hurt the environment."
" GLASGOW — China’s top climate change envoy, Xie Zhenhua, apologized as he entered late for a weekend meeting at the United Nations climate summit. “We have quite busy schedules,” Mr. Xie said, according to two people who were present for the exchange. “Especially for me, I have to meet with John Kerry almost every day.” In an unexpected development, the United States and China on Wednesday announced in a joint statement that they will both do more to cut fossil fuel pollution this decade. The terms of the deal weren’t groundbreaking — but the fact that agreement occurred at all is notable, considering the badly strained ties between Washington and Beijing over trade, human rights, Taiwan and other serious differences. Despite that, according to American and Chinese officials, the agreement was the product of months of meetings between Mr. Xie and Mr. Kerry, President Biden’s global climate envoy, before they arrived in Glasgow for the conference, known as COP26. The two also held near daily discussions at the summit, these officials said. ADVERTISEMENT Even as Mr. Biden earlier in the summit publicly scolded President Xi Jinping for not attending in person, setting off a round of sniping from Beijing in return, Mr. Xie and Mr. Kerry continued to quietly meet to discuss whether China could increase its ambition on climate. Over the past 10 days the two envoys, as well as their negotiating teams, met frequently in one or the other’s delegation office, windowless makeshift white rooms of thin partitions held together by metal hinges, set up in a cavernous exhibition center where the two weeks of talks are being held in Scotland. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Kerry, 77, and Mr. Xie, 72, have known one another for more than 20 years and both came out of retirement to take on their country’s top climate positions. Speaking through masked interpreters, they talked about their grandchildren, Mr. Kerry’s vacation home and Mr. Xie’s garden before launching into more intense negotiations about coal, methane and greenhouse gas emissions, according to a senior U.S. official who was part of the talks.  On Wednesday the world’s two largest greenhouse gas emitters sounded more like allies in the fight against climate change than fierce rivals, with both Mr. Xie and Mr. Kerry saying both nations were responsible for keeping rising global temperatures from reaching dangerous levels. “We both see the challenge of climate change is existential and a severe one,” Mr. Xie said. “As two major powers in the world, China and the United States, we need to take our due responsibility and work together and work with others in the spirit of cooperation to address climate change.” Tensions between the United States and China are at their highest point in years. Mr. Kerry said that he has been “honest” about concerns regarding China’s treatment of Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in China’s semiautonomous Xinjiang province, but said his focus has been to be “the climate guy.” He also said the two countries must work together to pivot away from fossil fuels no matter what other issues arise. António Guterres, the United Nations Secretary General, called it “an important step in the right direction.” Laurence Tubiana, France’s former climate change ambassador, said it shows “that the two countries can cooperate to address the climate crisis.” But experts agreed that the terms of the deal fall far short of an agreement that Mr. Kerry and Mr. Xie helped broker in 2014 in which both the United States and China jointly announced new targets to cut emissions. ADVERTISEMENT That moment was groundbreaking because China, as a developing country despite its skyrocketing emissions, was exempt under the rules of the U.N. climate body from taking mandatory action to cut emissions. The 2014 deal helped spur the Paris climate agreement one year later, in which nearly 200 nations of all levels of wealth and responsibility for causing climate change agreed to act. Wednesday’s joint U.S.-China declaration says that both countries will “accelerate the transition to a global net zero economy,” referring to the goal of net zero emissions of carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas. It also calls on both countries to strengthen their emissions plan. In addition, China agreed to “phase down” coal consumption during its 15th Five Year Plan, which starts in 2026. However, the agreement did not extract any new pledges from China about when it will stop spewing ever-larger amounts of fossil fuel emissions into the atmosphere and instead begin to reverse course. China has said it will stop increasing its greenhouse gas emissions before 2030, which it often refers to as the date they will “peak.” But in Wednesday’s agreement, China did not specify exactly when that would occur, and American officials have been pushing their counterparts to set a clear, earlier date. Mr. Kerry on Wednesday said the two countries discussed the issue many times, and insisted that the new agreement pushed China in the direction of bending the curve of emissions downward soon. ADVERTISEMENT Manish Bapna, the president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a Washington-based environmental group, said the agreement was “good news.” But, he said, “If we are to hold global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, we urgently need to see commitments to cooperate translate into bolder climate targets and credible delivery.” “It’s a climate truce,” said Nick Mabey, executive director of E3G, a climate change research group. While the agreement is not a major deal for new climate action, Mr. Mabey said, it has geopolitical significance by signaling China and the United States have ended “the war of words” that has contributed to tensions at the summit. Scientists have said that allowing global temperatures to rise more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels sharply increases the risk of calamities like deadly heat waves, water shortages and ecosystem collapse. The world has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius. China has resisted agreeing to a goal of keeping temperature rise to 1.5 degrees because it would require the country to make steeper and more immediate cuts than it has so far pledged. But in a significant step, China agreed to develop a “national plan” to cut methane — a potent greenhouse gas that the country has so far not mentioned in its plans for curbing emissions. ADVERTISEMENT China’s current national targets for cutting emissions, under the Paris accord, do not mention methane, the second most powerful greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Methane is the main component of natural gas and is also released into the atmosphere from landfills, livestock and thawing permafrost. However, China stopped short of joining a global methane pledge that Mr. Biden announced last week, in which more than 100 countries said they would aim to cut global methane emissions 30 percent by 2030. Speaking through an interpreter, Mr. Xie said, “There is more agreement between China and the U.S. than divergence.” With two days left in the Glasgow summit for the participating nations to put together a global deal, he added, “We hope that this joint declaration can make a contribution to the success” of the summit."

" GLASGOW, Scotland — Prime Minister Boris Johnson rushed back to the United Nations’ climate summit on Wednesday in a last-ditch effort to persuade countries to make more meaningful pledges to curb global warming. But his splashy return to the global stage was all but eclipsed by a mushrooming scandal over the lucrative business dealings of lawmakers from his Conservative Party. Mr. Johnson is not the only world leader whose global ambitions have been swamped by domestic distractions. Some, like President Biden, were hamstrung by political battles back home. Others, like President Xi Jinping of China, were no-shows as they struggled with the pandemic and other challenges. But as the host, Mr. Johnson’s split-screen moment was especially unforgiving: Rather than draw praise, as he had hoped, for his diplomacy on climate change, he has endured a skein of unflattering revelations about Conservative members of Parliament. The most recent embarrassment was a report that a former attorney general did legal work for the British Virgin Islands from his Westminster office, in violation of House of Commons rules. On Wednesday, Mr. Johnson tried his best to change the subject. “We need to pull out all the stops if we are to do what we came here to do,” he said at a news conference before the final two days of the climate conference, known as COP26. Mr. Johnson insisted a landmark deal was in reach, though he warned that several countries were falling short of necessary pledges. ADVERTISEMENT “Will you help us grasp that opportunity or will you stand in the way?” he said. “The risk of sliding back would be an absolute disaster.” Even in Glasgow, Mr. Johnson faced as many questions about the scandal as he did about his efforts to combat climate change. He was asked whether it was appropriate for lawmakers to put their private interests ahead of their constituents (he said it was not) and whether he would apologize for the damage to the country’s reputation (he did not). Onstage, trying to project statesmanship to a global audience, he instead found himself defending Britain’s honor. “I genuinely believe the U.K. is not remotely a corrupt country,” Mr. Johnson said, “nor do I believe our institutions are corrupt.” The latest politician to come under scrutiny for moonlighting is Geoffrey Cox, a lawyer who is defending the British Virgin Islands in a corruption investigation brought by the British government. While Mr. Cox is not barred from practicing law, the Times of London published a video that suggested he was advising his clients while taking breaks to cast votes in Parliament. The deputy head of the opposition Labour party, Angela Rayner, said she had referred Mr. Cox’s case to the Parliament’s commissioner for standards, calling it an “egregious, brazen breach of the rules.” ADVERTISEMENT In a statement, Mr. Cox denied any wrongdoing and said it should be up to his constituents to decide “whether or not they vote for someone who is a senior and distinguished professional in his field and who still practices that profession.” At his appearance on Wednesday, Mr. Johnson defended the ability of lawmakers to work as lawyers, doctors or firefighters, but he added, “The most important thing is those who break the rules must be investigated and should be punished.” For the prime minister, it was the latest in a web of ethics traps that have ensnared him and his party, from lucrative no-bid contracts for companies during the pandemic to questions about whether a party donor paid to redecorate the prime minister’s Downing Street apartment (Mr. Johnson later picked up the tab himself). With a 79-seat majority in Parliament, Mr. Johnson’s position is safe for now. But analysts said he risked alienating members of his party with a crisis largely of his own making. It grew out of his government’s misbegotten attempt last week to protect another embattled Conservative lawmaker, Owen Paterson, by pressuring Tory lawmakers to vote in favor of rewriting Parliament’s ethics rules. When that set off a storm of outrage from the opposition and in the media, the government was forced to backtrack and Mr. Paterson resigned. The spotlight quickly swung to other Conservative lawmakers, a few of whom earn more than $1 million a year from consulting contracts and other business deals. “The question is all about how this is enforced,” said Bronwen Maddox, director of the Institute for Government, a London research institute. “The present system works if the government does not dismantle it.” ADVERTISEMENT The scandal is taking a toll on Mr. Johnson’s popularity, which has dropped to its lowest levels since his landslide victory in 2019. In a recent survey by the firm Ipsos Mori, the Labour Party outpolled the Conservative Party by a single percentage point, 36 percent to 35 percent. “Just say sorry for the mess, prime minister,” declared the normally staunchly loyal tabloid, Daily Express. “The fact that this goes beyond Johnson, and Johnson himself is involved in it, is really problematic for him,” said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. “It allows the opposition to establish this pattern of behavior for both the leader and his troops.” It is also a major distraction at a moment when Mr. Johnson could have been working foreign officials in Glasgow. Rather than staying for the conference, the prime minister left Scotland last week just two days after it began. Downing Street said he moved up his return visit by a few days and was lobbying recalcitrant leaders, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, by phone. After being criticized for flying to London last week by private jet, Mr. Johnson took a train to Glasgow this time. But critics said his on-again, off-again engagement was typical of his approach in the months leading up to the meeting. Mr. Johnson left most of the diplomatic heavy lifting to Alok Sharma, a former business minister whom he named as president of COP26. “Right from the start, the prime minister has had an attention deficit,” said Tom Burke, a former government adviser and chairman of E3G, an environmental research group. “He should have gone to some of the critical countries himself.” Indeed, when the most notable announcement came on Wednesday, it was not Mr. Johnson who delivered it. The U.S. and China said they had agreed to do more to reduce emissions this decade, the result of some 30 meetings between the two countries, according to John Kerry, Mr. Biden’s climate envoy. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Johnson is not the only leader to face distractions. Mr. Biden arrived in Glasgow with Democrats still haggling over the shape of his climate legislation. While he labored to project a message of renewed American engagement, experts said other countries understandably harbored doubts about his ability to deliver. “U.S. influence on the world stage is diminished by uncertainty, among other global leaders, about whether President Biden can get the money to fund his increased ambition through Congress,” said John P. Holdren, a former scientific adviser to President Barack Obama. At least Mr. Biden made it to Glasgow. Mr. Xi of China, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil skipped the gathering, which climate experts said reduced the odds of their countries making a breakthrough commitment, even if they sent ample delegations to Scotland. While the political storms in London were not much of a topic in the hallways or meeting rooms in Glasgow, Mr. Burke said they would confirm the preconceptions of some of the other leaders — that Mr. Johnson is not a reliable counterpart. That could reduce their incentive to make more far-reaching climate pledges. “My sense is that he’s seen as a lightweight, and the other leaders don’t get the joke,” Mr. Burke said. Stephen Castle contributed reporting from London."
" GLASGOW — The United States and China announced a joint agreement Wednesday to “enhance ambition” on climate change, saying they would work together to do more to cut emissions this decade while China committed for the first time to reduce methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The pact between the world’s two biggest polluters came as a surprise to the thousands of attendees gathered here for a United Nations climate summit. China and the United States, rivals that face growing tensions over trade, human rights and other issues, spoke as allies in the fight to keep global warming to relatively safe levels.   “We both see the challenge of climate change is existential and a severe one,” said Xie Zhenhua, China’s climate change envoy. “As two major powers in the world, China and the United States, we need to take our due responsibility and work together and work with others in the spirit of cooperation to address climate change.” John Kerry, the U.S. special envoy for climate, followed the remarks from Mr. Xie with an assessment of his own. “The U.S. and China have no shortage of differences,” said Mr. Kerry, a former secretary of state with a long history of negotiating with the Chinese. “But on climate, cooperation is the only way to get this job done.” ADVERTISEMENT Still, the joint agreement was short on specifics. It did not extract a new timetable from China under which the country would ratchet down emissions, nor did China set a ceiling for how high its carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would reach before they started to fall. China agreed to “phase down” coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, starting in 2026, but did not specify by how much or over what period of time. The announcement from China and the United States came on the same day that summit organizers issued an initial draft of a new global agreement to fight climate change that called on countries to “revisit and strengthen” by the end of 2022 plans for cutting greenhouse gas emissions and to “accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels.” The language on coal and government fossil fuel subsidies would be a first for a U.N. climate agreement if it stays in the final version. ADVERTISEMENT Yet many countries and environmentalists said the rest of the document was still too vague on crucial details like what sorts of financial aid richer nations should provide poorer ones struggling with the costs of climate disasters and adaptation. The draft “is not the decisive language that this moment calls for,” said Aubrey Webson, chairman of the Alliance of Small Island States, a group of countries that are among those most threatened by climate change. Scientists have said that nations need to cut global emissions from fossil fuels roughly in half this decade to keep average global temperatures from rising beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, compared with preindustrial levels. Beyond that threshold, the risks of deadly heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods and species extinction grow considerably. The planet has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius. Negotiators here from nearly 200 countries are likely to demand significant changes to the draft as the talks enter their last, most difficult stretch. By tradition, a new global agreement requires every party to sign on. If any one nation objects, talks can deadlock. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, returned to Glasgow on Wednesday to urge countries to set aside differences and strike a deal. “The world has heard leaders from every country stand here and acknowledge the need for action,” he said. “And the world will find it absolutely incomprehensible if we fail to deliver that.” But persuading nations around the world, many of which depend on fossil fuels for energy and have their own internal politics and vested interests, to move in a new direction is a herculean challenge. Mr. Kerry said countries had no choice but to work together. “This is not a discretionary thing,” he said. “This is science, it’s math and physics that dictate the road we have to travel. And we cannot reach our goal unless everyone works together.” ADVERTISEMENT Several experts said the joint pact between China and the United States fell short of a 2014 deal between the United States and China to jointly curb emissions, which helped spur the Paris climate agreement among nearly 200 nations a year later. “While this is not a game changer in the way the 2014 U.S.-China climate deal was, in many ways it’s just as much of a step forward given the geopolitical state of the relationship,” said Thom Woodroofe, a former climate diplomat and a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute working on United States-China climate cooperation. “It means the intense level of U.S.-China dialogue on climate can now begin to translate into cooperation.” The agreement won praise among leaders and diplomats at the climate summit, who said they hoped it would inject fresh energy into the global negotiations aimed at keeping global temperatures from rising to dangerous levels. With just days remaining before the summit ends, negotiators are working late into the night to try to hammer out a global accord that, they hope, can satisfy every country — no easy task. Small island states like the Maldives, which has been inhabited for thousands of years but is projected to be swamped by rising seas within generations, want all countries to slash emissions as fast as possible. Oil and coal producers like Russia and Australia aren’t as eager to rapidly phase out fossil fuels. And large developing countries like India are holding out for financial help to shift to cleaner energy. There are four major areas of contention as negotiators try to reach a deal before the summit ends on Nov. 12. Under the landmark Paris climate agreement of 2015, every nation agreed that humanity should limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels while “pursuing efforts” to hold warming to just 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). ADVERTISEMENT To reach that target, each nation agreed to submit its own plan to shift away from fossil fuels and to curb deforestation, and to update those plans every five years. While everyone agreed that the initial pledges put forward in Paris were insufficient, the hope was that, over time, nations would ratchet up action and get closer to the goal. But there are a few big problems. First, the ratcheting process has been slow and uneven. Ahead of the Glasgow summit, most countries submitted new pledges to curb their emissions between now and 2030. Some, like the United States and European Union, vowed to make deeper cuts this decade. But others, such as Australia, Brazil and Russia, barely strengthened their short-term plans. When analysts added up the short-term pledges, they found that the world was likely on track to heat up around 2.4 to 2.7 degrees Celsius this century. That’s an improvement over Paris, but it would still increase the likelihood of climate catastrophes that could exacerbate hunger, disease and conflict. On top of that, many of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, such as Ethiopia and Bhutan, want the world to keep to the stricter target of 1.5 degrees Celsius, or else they will face unmanageable disasters. “1.5 degrees is what we need to survive,” Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados, said last week. “Two degrees is a death sentence for the people of Antigua and Barbuda, Maldives, Domenica, Fiji, Kenya, Mozambique, Samoa and Barbados.” How to speed up climate efforts remains a source of debate. Many vulnerable countries want countries to come back to the United Nations annually with stronger plans until the world is on track for 1.5 degrees Celsius. Currently, countries aren’t expected to update their plans until 2025, which some fear could be too late. ADVERTISEMENT But that proposal faces opposition from fossil fuel producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia. And there’s not even consensus that 1.5 degrees should be the official goal: The United States and the European Union have supported focusing on that stricter target, but some major emitters like China have balked. A tense era in U.S.-China ties. The two powers are profoundly at odds as they jockey for influence beyond their own shores, compete in technology and maneuver for military advantages. Here’s what to know about the main fronts in U.S.-China relations: Pacific dominance. As China has built up its military presence, the U.S. has sought to widen its alliances in the region. A major potential flash point is Taiwan, the democratic island that the Communist Party regards as Chinese territory. Should the U.S. intervene there, it could reshape the regional order. Trade. The trade war started by the Trump administration is technically on pause. But the Biden administration has continued to protest China’s economic policies and impose tariffs on Chinese goods, signaling no thaw in trade relations. Technology. Internet giants have mostly been shut out of China, but plenty of U.S. tech companies still do big business there, raising cybersecurity concerns in Washington. Mr. Xi has said China needs to achieve technological “self-reliance.” Human rights. Under Mr. Xi, China’s confrontations with the U.S. over values and freedoms have become more frequent, including standoffs over Beijing’s crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and mass detentions of Muslims in Xinjiang. World leadership. China’s leaders see signs of American decline everywhere and they want a bigger voice in global leadership, seeking a greater role in Western-dominated institutions and courting allies that share their frustration with the West. Money has long been a big sticking point in the global fight against climate change, and tensions over the topic have flared again in Glasgow. President Biden and European leaders have insisted that developing countries such as India, Indonesia or South Africa need to accelerate their shift away from coal power and other fossil fuels. But those countries counter that they lack the financial resources to do so, and that rich countries have been stingy with aid. A decade ago, the world’s wealthiest economies pledged to mobilize $100 billion per year in climate finance for poorer countries by 2020. But they have fallen short by tens of billions of dollars annually. At the same time, little climate aid to date has gone to help poorer countries cope with the hazards of a hotter planet, such as sea walls or early-warning systems for floods and droughts. Vulnerable nations are warning that they need far more help to survive. A group of African nations, along with China, India and Indonesia, has asked for as much as $1.3 trillion a year after 2025, That dwarfs anything that wealthy countries have been willing to propose so far. ADVERTISEMENT Even as vulnerable countries plead for more climate aid, they have asked for separate compensation for climate damages that they can’t adapt to. And they argue that wealthy nations like the United States and the European Union, which are historically responsible for most of the extra greenhouse gases now heating the atmosphere, should pay. This issue is known as “loss and damage.” “Lots of people are losing their lives, they are losing their future, and someone has to be responsible, and those people need to be compensated,” said A.K. Abdul Momen, the foreign minister of Bangladesh. Richer countries have, however, historically resisted calls for a specific funding mechanism for loss and damage, fearing that it could open the door to a flood of liability claims. Only the government of Scotland has been willing to offer specific dollar amounts, pledging $1.4 million last week for victims of climate disasters. One of the thorniest issues is how to regulate the fast-growing global market for carbon offsets. The Paris agreement urged clearer rules on this topic back in 2015, but negotiators have been unable to agree on the extremely dense and technical subject. Carbon offsets allow countries or businesses to compensate for their own emissions by paying for mitigation elsewhere. But it raises tricky questions about accounting, transparency and verification. ADVERTISEMENT Some climate advocates said they would prefer negotiators to leave Glasgow without a resolution on these issues rather than with weak rules. “No point in accepting phony carbon credits into the system, which would directly increase warming,” wrote Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa, a research institute in Kenya. Developing countries have also called for a percentage of proceeds from all carbon credit trades to be set aside for an adaptation fund. But the European Union has criticized this idea, calling it a “mandatory international tax.”  "
" With the summit moving into its final days in Glasgow, its host, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, pleaded with officials and negotiators on Wednesday to seize the opportunity to strike an ambitious agreement that would avert the worst effects of climate change. “Here in Glasgow, the world has been closer than it has ever been to signaling the beginning of the end of anthropogenic climate change,” he said. “We just need to reach out together and grasp it.” Mr. Johnson declined to single out countries that have yet to commit to a framework, saying, “I think everybody knows who needs to do what.” But he pleaded with world leaders to give their representatives more room to bargain and called on negotiators to “pull out all the stops.” “Now is the time to get together and show the determination needed to power on through the blockages,” he said. He warned bluntly that if agreements driven by world leaders and negotiators failed, the world would find it “absolutely incomprehensible.” ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Johnson’s comments on Wednesday were in line with his doomsday rhetoric earlier in the conference, when he likened the price of not reaching an agreement to how “a red digital clock ticks down remorselessly to a detonation that will end human life as we know it.” Britain’s hosting of the summit has been blemished by scandals closer to home, with Conservative lawmakers accused of using their positions for financial gain. Mr. Johnson, a Conservative, avoided questions on Wednesday about the allegations, but he said that lawmakers who were not putting the interests of their constituents first “should face appropriate sanctions and punishment.”"
" We’re also covering a deal to phase out gasoline cars, the gender gap at the conference and more. By Lisa Friedman and Brad Plumer With the climate summit in Glasgow heading toward its closing session, the United Nations issued a draft agreement late Wednesday that countries will use as a template for a global agreement on stronger action against global warming. But big hurdles remain at the conference, which is scheduled to close on Friday. The draft calls on countries to “revisit and strengthen” their plans for cutting planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. And, it asks rich countries to “urgently scale up their provision of climate finance” to help developing nations adapt to global warming. But there were no firm deadlines nor enforcement mechanisms in the draft. So, now, roughly 200 nations need to hammer out the details, and agree on who foots the bill. By tradition, a final agreement requires every party to sign on. If any one country objects, talks can deadlock. And each country brings its own set of often competing interests. Small island states like the Maldives, facing an imminent threat from rising seas, want all countries to slash emissions as fast as possible. Oil producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia are not eager to rapidly phase out fossil fuels. And big developing countries like India are holding out for more help to shift to cleaner energy. ADVERTISEMENT Our team in Glasgow will be covering the talks live for the rest of the week. You can follow the Wednesday sessions here. The numbers: One of the main goals at the climate conference is a global pact to keep the average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, compared with preindustrial levels. Beyond that threshold, scientists say, the likelihood of deadly heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods and biodiversity collapse rises sharply. The planet has already warmed by 1.1 degrees Celsius. Trust, but verify: Satellites could be used to help determine whether nations are keeping their greenhouse gas pledges. By Brad Plumer and Hiroko Tabuchi At least six major automakers and more than two dozen national governments pledged on Wednesday to work toward phasing out sales of new gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles by 2040 worldwide and by 2035 in “leading markets.” ADVERTISEMENT The automakers who signed the pledge included Ford, Mercedes-Benz, General Motors and Volvo. Together, they accounted for roughly one-quarter of global sales in 2019. “Having these major players making these commitments, though we need to make sure that they follow through, is really significant,” said Margo Oge, a former senior U.S. air quality official who now advises both environmental groups and auto companies. “It really tells us that these companies, and their boards, accept that the future is electric.” Why it matters: Transportation accounts for roughly one-fifth of humanity’s carbon dioxide emissions, with a little less than half of that coming from passenger vehicles like cars and vans. The United States did not join: Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, said the Biden administration was “focused on what we are doing at home.” Looking to the future: Rivian, a maker of electric trucks and vans, is going public and has set a stock price that values the company at nearly $70 billion.

By Somini Sengupta The Glasgow talks began with more than 130 presidents and prime ministers posing for a group photo in a century-old museum. Fewer than 10 were women. Their median age was over 60. ADVERTISEMENT The first week of the talks ended with boisterous protests of thousands on the streets of Glasgow. A march on Friday was led by young climate activists, most of them women and some barely old enough to vote in their countries. They accused the world leaders of wasting what little time remains to safeguard their future. Those bookends to the first week of the talks revealed a widening divide that threatens to grow larger in the weeks and months ahead. Video: More than 100,000 demonstrators marched in Glasgow, according to protest organizers. The numbers: Leaders at the summit are setting goals for 2030 at the earliest. In some cases, they’re setting targets for 2060 and 2070, when many of today’s activists will be hitting retirement age. Quotable: Future generations “will judge us with bitterness and with a resentment that eclipses any of the climate activists of today,” Prime Minister Johnson of Britain said in his opening remarks at the conference.

More than 40 countries have pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from their health industries. By Shola Lawal Who gets to keep using fossil fuels, and for how long, during the transition to clean energy? That’s one of the big questions at COP26. A swift transition to renewable energy is crucial in the global fight against climate change. But not only would that be particularly costly in poorer nations, many African countries have an abundance of natural gas or other fossil fuels. Plus, Sub-Saharan Africa contributes about 3 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, among the lowest of the world’s regions. “African countries are the ones on the receiving end of this problem. It’s the bigger emitters that should have the responsibility to cut,” said Titus Gwemende, the Zimbabwe-based climate director at the Open Society Foundation. “We should be sensitive to history.” That’s why some African leaders and activists are, for the first time, vocally opposing a speedier pivot to renewables for their countries. Instead, they are pressing for a slower transition, one that would embrace a continued reliance on fossil fuels — particularly natural gas, which burns more cleanly than coal or oil, but which still pumps planet-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

" Last summer, New York City endured three heat waves and many days when the temperature climbed above 90 degrees. In some neighborhoods, like the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx, which ranks as one of the city’s most vulnerable areas to heat, extreme temperatures actually linger, contributing to increases in heat-related illness and deaths. This sweltering effect can be attributed to the built environment, with its lack of protective tree shade and swarms of traffic and surroundings cramped with glass, asphalt, metal and concrete. Installing cool roofs, which involves lightening the surface color of rooftops to reflect and not absorb heat, can temper excessive heat from the top down and reduce the urban heat island effect — a common and adverse consequence of climate change where air temperatures are significantly higher in a city than in surrounding areas, even at night. The Hunts Point Produce Market, the country’s largest wholesale produce market and a longtime mainstay in the borough, took a step toward climate action in October, coating about 30,000 square feet of its dark 800,000-square-foot roof with a material known as Elasto-Kool 1000, a white paint infused with silicone to reflect solar heat and UV rays and decrease indoor and surface temperatures during summer months. The coated roof is expected to help cut down on the energy use for air-conditioning, reducing the amount of greenhouse gases expelled into the atmosphere. The remainder of the roof is expected to be coated in 2022 or later, depending on the availability of funds. ADVERTISEMENT The project was part of the city initiative NYC CoolRoofs and was being completed by workers of the HOPE Program, a nonprofit organization which provides job training and professional development resources to New Yorkers seeking opportunities in climate-focused industries. To date, CoolRoofs, in partnership with city agencies and grant funding from the Environmental Protection Agency, has covered more than 10 million square feet of rooftops since 2009. “We are making an impact on the environment and on people’s individual lives,” said Zakiyah Sayyed, 36, who resides in the South Bronx and is a crew supervisor for the Hope Program. “We have projects all across the city, so I can see the impact that we are making in NYC.” “Rooftops present an important opportunity to both mitigate and adapt to climate change, and to address a range of environmental and social issues,” said Emily Nobel Maxwell, the cities director for the Nature Conservancy in New York. Combining different roofing types with reflective coatings and solar panels can boost energy benefits. A new 11,500-square-foot “green roof” at 399 Sands Street in the Brooklyn Navy Yard features a mix of sedum and wildflowers, and its effect is augmented by a white cool-roof system by Siplast, a commercial manufacturer. It is atop a property owned by Steiner NYC and was installed by Brooklyn Grange, an organization that designs and maintains green roofs, featuring vegetation, and rooftop farms. “Every roof has the potential to help solve the climate crisis,” said Gwen Schantz, Brooklyn Grange’s co-founder and chief creative officer. ADVERTISEMENT The de Blasio Administration launched Cool Neighborhoods NYC, furthering a strategy that would focus on locations with the highest scores on a heat vulnerability index, such as some neighborhoods in Brooklyn and the Bronx. Under the 2019 Climate Mobilization Act, New York City mandates that new roofs feature reflective surfaces and, if eligible, solar panels or a green-roof system. The NYC CoolRoofs program, which supports the city’s goal to reduce carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050, offers free installations on affordable housing and buildings that house nonprofits, and low-cost installations to other buildings willing to cover the cost of coating materials. The New York City Housing Authority, the public housing agency that is the largest landlord in the city, expects that 2,300 of its 2,500 buildings will have cool-roof features in place in the next few years. “To date, 623 cool roofs have been installed along with full-roof replacements that are more effective at insulating the apartments below them,” said Rochel Leah Goldblatt, deputy press secretary for NYCHA. Though cool roofs are often associated with large buildings, such as Ford Field, the 340,000-square-foot domed football stadium in downtown Detroit, reflective materials such as paint, shingles, tiles or specialized metal sheets, can be installed on private homes. Costs will vary depending on the location, condition of the roof and materials required, but compared to traditional roofing products, cool roof coatings can run up to 20 cents more per square foot, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. On hot summer days, cool roofs can reduce air-conditioning costs by 10 percent to 30 percent, according to NYC CoolRoofs. ADVERTISEMENT The Cool Roof Rating Council, an independent nonprofit based in Portland, Ore., that evaluates the reflective performance of roofing products, said there are rebates and incentives for cool roofs and other energy-saving projects, searchable via their site, coolroofs.org, or on dsireusa.org, the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency. Jeffrey Steuben, executive director for the council, noted that cool roofs need not be covered in white; alternative hues for the coating include gray and terra cotta, among others. The council said it would begin a similar review program dedicated to products for vertical surfaces in January 2022. “There are a growing number of codes and programs that are specifying solar reflective walls,” Steuben said. For now, there’s ample real estate in New York that can be evaluated for a cool-roof makeover ahead of next summer, said Ms. Nobel Maxwell of the Nature Conservancy. “There are more than a million buildings in New York City that, in total, have about 40,000 acres of rooftops, which is about the size of a whole additional borough.” For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

" Pete Buttigieg wants to retire the phrase “save the planet.” Speaking in Glasgow at the United Nations climate change summit, Mr. Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, said that the conversation surrounding climate change should be refocused on whether the planet can sustain life. “What we’re trying to save is lives,” he said. Mr. Buttigieg was joined by Katharine Hayhoe, an atmospheric scientist at Texas Tech University, who often speaks about how to effectively communicate the science of climate change. “The planet will be orbiting the sun long after we are gone,” she said. “The planet does not need us. We’re the ones who need the planet.” The discussion, which took place on the sidelines of global climate change negotiations, was part of high-level talks on Tuesday about ways to cut emissions from the transportation sector. Climate pollution from roads, rails, ships and airplanes account for about 24 percent of total global emissions and are rapidly rising. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Buttigieg said in an interview that he views a $1.2 trillion infrastructure package that the U.S. House and Senate recently passed through the lens of climate change. The transportation department will oversee hundreds of billions of dollars worth of improvements to roads, rails and bridges — work that could lead to a rise in emissions if green technologies are not sufficiently incorporated. “We are paying a lot of attention to the climate implications of the choices we are making,” Mr. Buttigieg said, noting that in addition to road expansions the bill also provides funding for public transportation, bike lanes and new electric vehicle charging stations. But the U.S. did not join countries in an international pledge to rapidly phase out gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles, Mr. Buttigieg said Tuesday, adding that the Biden administration is “focused on what we are doing at home.” The pledge by six automakers and about 30 countries to phase out sales of new gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles by 2040 worldwide — and by 2035 in “leading markets” — would move at a faster pace than the Biden administration has called for. Mr. Biden has signed an executive order aimed at ensuring that 50 percent of all new vehicles sold in the United States are electric by 2030, a move made with the support of major automakers. ADVERTISEMENT “Different countries obviously are taking different approaches,” Mr. Buttigieg said. “We have to do what’s right for the United States and also support international action. That’s the balance, I think, that we’re striking.” Britain, Canada and India are among those that joined the pledge, along with California and Washington State."
" MONTARGIS, France — Just 75 miles separate this provincial town from Paris, but if the capital is all about a renewable energy revolution, the talk here is of how it costs people way too much. “We want to go too fast,” said Jean-Pierre Door, a conservative lawmaker with a lot of angry constituents. “People are being pushed to the limit.” Three years ago, Montargis became a center of the Yellow Vest social uprising, an angry protest movement over an increase in gasoline taxes that was sustained, sometimes violently, for more than year by a much broader sense of alienation felt by those in the outlying areas that France calls its “periphery.” The uprising was rooted in a class divide that exposed the resentment of many working-class people, whose livelihoods are threatened by the clean-energy transition, against the metropolitan elites, especially in Paris, who can afford electric cars and can bicycle to work, unlike those in the countryside. ADVERTISEMENT Now as Mr. Door and others watch the global climate talks underway in Glasgow, where experts and officials are warning that immediate action must be taken in the face of a looming environmental catastrophe, the economic and political disconnect that nearly tore apart France three years ago remains just below the surface. There are plenty of people in the “periphery” who understand the need to transition to clean energy and are already trying to do their part. But if the theme of COP26, as the Glasgow summit is known, is how time is running out to save the planet, the immediate concern here is how money is running out before the end of the month. Household gas prices are up 12.6 percent in the past month alone, partly the result of shortages linked to the coronavirus. Electric cars seem fancifully expensive to people encouraged not so long ago to buy fuel-efficient diesel automobiles. A wind turbine that will slash property values is not what a retired couple wants just down the road. “If Parisians love wind turbines so much, why not rip up the Bois de Vincennes and make an attraction of them?” asked Magali Cannault, who lives near Montargis, alluding to the vast park to the east of Paris. ADVERTISEMENT For President Emmanuel Macron, facing an election in April, the transition to clean energy has become a delicate subject. He has portrayed himself as a green warrior, albeit a pragmatic one, but knows that any return to the barricades of the Yellow Vests would be disastrous for his election prospects. Each morning, at her farm a few miles from town, Ms. Cannault gazes from her doorstep at a 390-foot mast built recently to gauge wind levels for proposed turbines. “Nobody ever consulted us on this.” The only sounds as she spoke on a misty, damp morning were the honking of geese and the crowing of roosters. Claude Madec-Cleï, the mayor of the nearby village of Griselles, nodded. “We are not considered,” he said. “President Macron is courting the Greens.” In fact, with the election looming, Mr. Macron is courting just about everyone and is desperate to avoid a return of the Yellow Vests. The government has frozen household gas prices. An “energy check” worth $115 will be sent next month to some six million people judged most in need. An “inflation indemnity” for the same amount also will be sent to about 38 million people earning less than $2,310 a month. Gasoline inflation has been a main driver of these measures. Sophie Tissier, who has organized more than a hundred Yellow Vest demonstrations, said a heavy police response made it “very hard to restart the movement,” despite what she called “a grave social crisis and rampant anger.” She added that inequalities were so extreme in France that “it prevents us making an ecological transition.” ADVERTISEMENT The president touts the realism of his energy proposals. These combine the development of new small-reactor nuclear power with the embrace of wind power and other renewables. To his left, the Green movement wants nuclear power, which accounts for 67.1 percent of France’s electricity needs, phased out, an adjustment so enormous that it is derided by conservatives as heralding “a return to the candlelight era.” To Mr. Macron’s right, Marine Le Pen favors the dismantling of the country’s more than 9,000 wind turbines, which account for 7.9 percent of France’s electricity production. In the middle, millions of French people, buffeted between concern for the planet and their immediate needs, struggle to adjust. Christine Gobet drives her small diesel car about 90 miles a day from the Montargis area to her job at an Amazon warehouse on the outskirts of Orléans, where she prepares packages and earns about $1,600 a month. Sitting at the wheel outside a garage where her diesel engine had just been replaced at a cost of about $3,000, she mocked the notion of switching to an electric car. ADVERTISEMENT “For people like me, electric is just out of the question,” she said. “Everything’s going up, there’s even talk of more expensive baguettes! We were pushed to diesel, told it was less polluting. Now we are told the opposite.” At the start of the Yellow Vest movement, she joined demonstrations in Montargis. It was not just financial pressure that pushed her. It was a sense that “we are not listened to, that it’s those elites up on high who decide and we just suffer the consequences.” She dropped out of the movement when it became violent. At a traffic circle on the edge of Montargis, known as the “peanut roundabout” because of its shape, traffic was blocked for two months, and stores ran out of stock. Today, she feels that little has changed. In Paris, she said, “they have everything.” Anne Hidalgo, the Paris mayor and a socialist candidate for the presidency, wants “no more cars in the city and has no time for people from the provinces who go there to work.” For working-class people like Ms. Gobet, who was mentioned in a recent 100-part series called “Fragments of France” in the newspaper Le Monde, calls in Glasgow to stop using fossil fuels and close nuclear power stations appear wildly remote from their daily lives. At 58, she illustrates a generational chasm. The world’s youth led by Greta Thunberg is on one side, convinced that no priority can be more urgent than saving the planet. On the other are older people who, as Mr. Door put it, “don’t want the last 20 years of their lives ruined by environmental measures that drive energy prices up and the value of the house they put their money in down.” ADVERTISEMENT The area around Montargis has attracted many retirees who want to be close to Paris without paying Paris prices, as well as many immigrants who live on the outskirts of town. Gilles Fauvin, a taxi driver with a diesel Peugeot, was at the same garage as Ms. Gobet. He said most of his business comes from taking clients with medical needs to hospitals in Orléans and Paris. The combination of plans to ban diesel cars from the capital by 2024 and pressure to switch to expensive electric cars could ruin him. “Diesel works for me,” he said. But of course, diesel cars produce several pollutants. The question for Yoann Fauvin, the owner of the garage and the taxi driver’s cousin, is whether electric cars are really better. “You have to mine the metals for the batteries in China or Chile, you have to transport them with all the carbon costs of that, you have to recycle the batteries,” he said. In front of him, a classic green 1977 Citroen 2CV was being reconditioned and a diesel Citroen DS4 repaired. “This business lives from diesel,” he said. “Around here energy transformation is laughed at. It’s wealthy people who move to electric cars, the people who don’t understand what goes on around here.” Magalie Pasquier, a homemaker who heads a local association against wind power called Aire 45, said her opposition to about 75 new turbines planned for the area has nothing to do with dismissing environmental concerns. ADVERTISEMENT She recycles. She is careful about traveling. She composts. She wears two sweaters rather than turn up the heat. She finds the environmental idealism of the young inspiring. But the world, she believes, has put the cart before the horse. “Why destroy a landscape that attracts people to this area when the real energy issue is overconsumption?” she asked. “Local people are not consulted, and even mayors are powerless to stop these ugly turbines.” A friend, Philippe Jacob, a professor of management and marketing also involved in the movement against the turbines, said the Yellow Vest movement had stemmed from rising gasoline prices, falling purchasing power, deteriorating public services, and widespread dissatisfaction with top-down decision making. “The same is true today, and the situation is very dangerous,” he said. “People have invested their life savings here, and nobody listens when they say planned turbines and biogas plants will mean the region is ruined.”"
" MONTARGIS, Francia — Solo 120 kilómetros separan a esta ciudad provincial de París, pero mientras en la capital se habla de una revolución de la energía renovable, aquí se dice que eso le cuesta demasiado a la gente. “Queremos ir demasiado rápido”, dijo Jean-Pierre Door, un legislador conservador con muchos electores enfadados. “La gente está llegando al límite”. Hace tres años, Montargis se convirtió en el centro de la revuelta social de los “chalecos amarillos”, un movimiento de protesta que fue desencadenado por el aumento de los impuestos sobre la gasolina, pero que se mantuvo —a veces de forma violenta— durante más de un año por el sentimiento de alienación que sienten los habitantes de la “periferia”, que es como el gobierno francés denomina a las zonas alejadas de la capital. ADVERTISEMENT La revuelta tuvo su origen en una división de clases que evidenció el resentimiento de muchas personas de la clase trabajadora, cuyos medios de vida se ven amenazados por la transición a la energía limpia, contra las élites metropolitanas, en especial las de París, que pueden comprar autos eléctricos e ir al trabajo en bicicleta, a diferencia de los habitantes del campo. Ahora, mientras Door y otros observan las conversaciones mundiales sobre el clima que se están celebrando en Glasgow, en las que expertos y funcionarios advierten que hay que tomar medidas inmediatas ante la inminente catástrofe medioambiental, la desconexión económica y política que hace tres años estuvo a punto de destrozar el país sigue latente. Hay mucha gente en la “periferia” que entiende la necesidad de la transición a la energía limpia y ya está tratando de poner su granito de arena. Pero si el tema principal de la COP 26, como se conoce la cumbre de Glasgow, es cómo se está acabando el tiempo para salvar el planeta, aquí la preocupación inmediata es cómo se está acabando el dinero antes de que acabe el mes. El precio del gas para consumo doméstico aumentó un 12,6 por ciento tan solo en el último mes, en parte como consecuencia de la escasez relacionada con la pandemia de coronavirus. Los autos eléctricos parecen estar fuera del alcance de las personas a las que no hace mucho se les animaba a comprar automóviles de diésel de bajo consumo. Un aerogenerador que reducirá el valor de las propiedades no es lo que quiere una pareja de jubilados más adelante. ADVERTISEMENT “Si a los parisinos les gustan tanto los aerogeneradores, ¿por qué no arrasan con el Parque de Vincennes y los ponen ahí para convertirlos en una atracción?”, se pregunta Magali Cannault, quien vive cerca de Montargis, en alusión al vasto parque situado al este de París. Para el presidente de Francia, Emmanuel Macron, quien se enfrenta a las elecciones de abril, la transición a las energías limpias se ha convertido en un tema delicado. Dice ser un guerrero ecológico, aunque pragmático, pero sabe que cualquier retorno a las barricadas de los chalecos amarillos sería desastroso para su futuro electoral. Todas las mañanas, en su granja, a pocos kilómetros de la ciudad, Cannault contempla desde la puerta de su casa un mástil de unos 119 metros construido hace poco para medir los niveles de viento de las turbinas propuestas. “Nadie nos consultó sobre su instalación”. Los únicos sonidos que se escuchaban mientras hablaba durante una mañana húmeda y brumosa eran el graznido de los gansos y el canto de los gallos. Claude Madec-Cleï, alcalde del cercano pueblo de Griselles, coincide con esa opinión. “No nos consideran”, dijo. “El presidente Macron quiere quedar bien con los Verdes”. De hecho, con la cercanía de las elecciones, Macron corteja a casi todos los sectores y está desesperado por evitar el regreso de los chalecos amarillos. El gobierno ha congelado los precios del gas doméstico. El mes próximo se enviará un “cheque de energía” por valor de 115 dólares a unos seis millones de personas que se considera que son el sector más necesitado. También se enviará una “indemnización por inflación” por la misma cantidad a 38 millones de personas que ganan menos de 2310 dólares al mes. La inflación de la gasolina ha sido uno de los principales impulsores de estas medidas. ADVERTISEMENT Sophie Tissier, quien ha organizado más de un centenar de manifestaciones de los chalecos amarillos, dijo que la intensa respuesta policial hizo que fuera “muy difícil reiniciar el movimiento”, a pesar de lo que ella define como “una grave crisis social y una ira desenfrenada”. Tissier dice que las desigualdades son tan extremas en Francia que les “impide hacer una transición ecológica”. El mandatario pregona el realismo de sus propuestas energéticas que combinan el desarrollo de nuevas centrales nucleares pequeñas con la adopción de la energía eólica y otras energías renovables. Desde la izquierda, el movimiento de los Verdes quiere que la energía nuclear, que representa el 67,1 por ciento de las necesidades de electricidad de Francia, se elimine poco a poco, lo cual representa un ajuste tan enorme que los conservadores lo ridiculizan como el anuncio de “un retorno a la era de alumbrarse con velas”. Desde la derecha, Marine Le Pen está a favor del desmantelamiento de los más de 9000 aerogeneradores del país, que suponen el 7,9 por ciento de la producción eléctrica de Francia. En medio, millones de franceses, que se debaten entre la preocupación por el planeta y sus necesidades inmediatas, luchan por adaptarse. Christine Gobet conduce su pequeño auto de diésel unos 145 kilómetros al día desde la zona de Montargis hasta su trabajo en un almacén de Amazon en las afueras de Orleans, donde prepara paquetes y gana unos 1600 dólares al mes. ADVERTISEMENT Sentada al volante frente a un taller mecánico en el que le acaban de cambiar el motor diésel, por unos 3000 dólares, se mofa de la idea de cambiar a un auto eléctrico. “Para la gente como yo, la electricidad está descartada”, dijo. “Todo sube, ¡incluso se habla de baguettes más caras! Nos empujaron al diésel, nos dijeron que era menos contaminante. Ahora nos dicen lo contrario”. Cuando comenzó el movimiento de los chalecos amarillos, se unió a las manifestaciones en Montargis. No solo tomó esa decisión por la presión financiera. Tenía la sensación de que no los escuchan, “las élites de arriba son las que deciden y nosotros simplemente sufrimos las consecuencias”. Ella abandonó el movimiento cuando se volvió violento. En una rotonda a las afueras de Montargis, conocida como la “rotonda de los cacahuetes” por su forma, el tráfico estuvo bloqueado durante dos meses y las tiendas agotaron sus existencias. En la actualidad, cree que poco ha cambiado. En París, dice, “tienen de todo”. Anne Hidalgo, alcaldesa de París y candidata socialista a la presidencia, quiere que “no haya más vehículos en la ciudad y no tiene paciencia con la gente de provincia que va allí a trabajar”. ADVERTISEMENT Para personas de la clase trabajadora como Gobet, mencionada en una reciente serie de 100 artículos titulada “Fragmentos de Francia” en el periódico Le Monde, los llamados en Glasgow para dejar de utilizar combustibles fósiles y cerrar las centrales nucleares parecen muy alejados de su vida cotidiana. A sus 58 años, es un ejemplo del abismo generacional. De un lado está la juventud mundial liderada por Greta Thunberg, convencida de que ninguna prioridad puede ser más urgente que salvar el planeta. En el otro están las personas mayores que, como dice Door, “no quieren que los últimos 20 años de su vida se arruinen con medidas medioambientales que hagan subir el precio de la energía y bajar el valor de la casa en la que invierten su dinero”. Las zonas cercanas a Montargis atraen a muchos jubilados que quieren estar cerca de París, sin pagar los precios de París, así como a muchos inmigrantes que viven en las afueras de la ciudad. Gilles Fauvin, un taxista que tiene un Peugeot diésel, estaba en el mismo garaje que Gobet. Dijo que la mayor parte de su negocio proviene de trasladar a clientes con necesidades médicas a los hospitales ubicados en Orleans y París. La combinación de planes para prohibir los autos diésel en la capital para 2024 y la presión para cambiar a costosos vehículos eléctricos podrían arruinarlo. “El diésel funciona para mí”, dijo. Pero, por supuesto, los automóviles diésel producen varios contaminantes. La pregunta para Yoann Fauvin, el dueño del garaje y primo del taxista, es si los autos eléctricos son realmente mejores. “Tienes que extraer los metales para las baterías en China o Chile, tienes que transportarlos con todos los costos de carbono que eso conlleva, tienes que reciclar las baterías”, dijo. Frente a él, un Citroen 2CV verde clásico de 1977 estaba siendo reacondicionado y un Citroen DS4 diésel ya estaba reparado. “Este negocio vive del diésel”, dijo. “Aquí nos reímos de la transformación energética. Las personas adineradas son las que se pasan a los coches eléctricos, las personas que no comprenden lo que sucede aquí”. ADVERTISEMENT Magalie Pasquet, un ama de casa que lidera una asociación local contra la energía eólica llamada Aire 45, dijo que su oposición a unas 75 nuevas turbinas previstas en la zona no tiene nada que ver con despreciar las preocupaciones medioambientales. Ella recicla. Tiene cuidado al viajar. Hace composta con desechos orgánicos. Usa dos suéteres para no subir la calefacción. El idealismo medioambiental de los jóvenes le parece inspirador. Pero cree que el mundo está poniendo el carro delante de los bueyes. “¿Por qué destruir un paisaje que atrae a la gente a esta zona cuando el verdadero problema energético es el exceso de consumo?

" GLASGOW — At least six major automakers — including Ford, Mercedes-Benz, General Motors and Volvo — and 30 national governments pledged on Wednesday to work toward phasing out sales of new gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles by 2040 worldwide, and by 2035 in “leading markets.” But some of the world’s biggest car manufacturers, including Toyota, Volkswagen, and the Nissan-Renault alliance did not join the pledge, which is not legally binding. And the governments of the United States, China and Japan, three of the largest car markets, also abstained. The announcement, made during international climate talks here, was hailed by climate advocates as yet another sign that the days of the internal combustion engine could soon be numbered. Electric vehicles continue to set new global sales records each year and major car companies have recently begun investing tens of billions of dollars to retool their factories and churn out new battery-powered cars and light trucks. “Having these major players making these commitments, though we need to make sure that they follow through, is really significant,” said Margo Oge, a former senior U.S. air quality official who now advises both environmental groups and auto companies. “It really tells us that these companies, and their boards, accept that the future is electric.” ADVERTISEMENT The automakers that signed the pledge accounted for roughly one-quarter of global sales in 2019. The 30 countries that joined the coalition included Britain, Canada, India, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Sweden. Earlier counts, based on news releases from conference organizers, had placed the number of national governments at 29 and 31. The addition of India was especially notable, since it is the world’s fourth-largest auto market and has not previously committed to eliminating emissions from its cars on a specific timeline. Other countries vowing for the first time to sell only zero-emissions vehicles by a set date included  Turkey, Croatia, Ghana and Rwanda. California, New York State and Washington State also signed the pledge. Last year, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California signed an executive order saying that only new zero-emissions vehicles would be sold in the state by 2035, though regulators have not yet issued rules to make that happen. Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York signed into law a bill that set a similar goal earlier this year. Washington had not previously made such a formal pledge. The agreement states that automakers will “work toward reaching 100 percent zero-emission new car and van sales in leading markets by 2035 or earlier, supported by a business strategy that is in line with achieving this ambition, as we help build customer demand.” ADVERTISEMENT Zero-emissions vehicles could include either plug-in electric vehicles or hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, although the latter have struggled to gain market share. Electric cars can still indirectly produce emissions if, for instance, they are recharged with power from plants that burn coal or natural gas. But they are generally considered cleaner overall than combustion engine vehicles and do not create pollution from their tailpipes. Two dozen vehicle fleet operators, including Uber and LeasePlan, also joined the coalition, vowing to operate only zero-emissions vehicles by 2030, “or earlier where markets allow.” Worldwide, transportation accounts for roughly one-fifth of humanity’s carbon dioxide emissions that are responsible for climate change, with a little less than half of that coming from passenger vehicles such as cars and vans. In recent years, spurred by concerns about global warming and air pollution, governments around the world — including China, the United States and the European Union — have begun heavily subsidizing electric vehicles and imposing more stringent emissions standards on new gasoline- and diesel-fueled cars. The cost of lithium-ion batteries has also declined roughly 80 percent since 2013, according to BloombergNEF, an energy research group, making electric vehicles increasingly competitive with traditional combustion engine vehicles, though many consumers remain wary of the new technology because of concerns like the availability of charging stations. “We have the technology to make clean road transport a reality and today it’s clear we have the willpower to do it in the next decade,” said Nigel Topping, who was appointed by the British government to the United Nations to be a “high level climate action champion.” Some of the automakers that signed the agreement had already pledged to clean up the cars they produce. G.M. said in January that it aimed to stop selling new gasoline-powered cars and light trucks by 2035 and will pivot to battery-powered vehicles. Volvo had said it expected its car lineup to be fully electric by 2030. ADVERTISEMENT But the pledge appeared to commit some of the signatories to doing more than they had previously promised. Ford, which this year introduced an electric version of its best-selling F-150 pickup truck, had previously only said it expected 40 percent of its global vehicle mix to be electric by 2030. “We are moving now to deliver breakthrough electric vehicles for the many rather than the few,” said Cynthia Williams, global director of sustainability at Ford. The other two automakers that signed the pledge were BYD, a Chinese automaker that has made major inroads selling electric cars in Europe, as well as Jaguar Land Rover. Some of the major automakers that did not sign the agreement are nonetheless investing heavily in electric vehicle technology. Volkswagen, which six years ago confessed to rigging its diesel cars to conceal illegally high emissions, has since outlined plans to spend tens of billions of dollars to build six battery factories, install a global network of charging stations and roll out more than 80 new electric models by 2025. Nicolai Laude, a Volkswagen spokesman, said while the German automaker was committed to a rapid shift toward electric vehicles, it did not join the new pledge because the global nature of its business meant it had to be mindful that “regions developing at different speed combined with different local prerequisites need different pathways” to zero emissions. Toyota, the world’s best-selling automaker in 2020, was also notably missing from the list of signatories, though it announced plans this year to sell 15 electric vehicle models around the world by 2025. The Japanese automaker has been more cautious on electric vehicle technology, continuing to bet on alternatives like hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles. Toyota did not immediately comment."
" Rolls-Royce, the British jet engine maker, said on Tuesday that it was forming a business to build a series of smaller, cheaper nuclear reactors as Britain looks for ways to cut carbon emissions and to reduce the costs of nuclear energy. The kind of reactor proposed by Rolls-Royce would cover about two soccer fields, or about one-tenth the acreage of a conventional nuclear power station, the company said. These plants would generate less power — about one-seventh the output of the giant nuclear installation being built at Hinkley Point in southwest England. But Rolls-Royce said it hoped to reduce construction costs to around 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) each, compared with an estimated £22.5 billion for the Hinkley Point plant. Some of the savings would come from building a large number of plants and making modules in factories that can then be assembled at sites. ADVERTISEMENT The company hopes to build 16 of the plants, known as small modular reactors, and said each could power around one million homes. The British government will contribute a grant of £210 million to develop the plants, while Rolls-Royce and its partners, including Exelon Generation, an American nuclear power company, and BNF Resources, a private company, would together invest £195 million over three years. The government is looking for sources of clean power to replace Britain’s aging nuclear plants, although the Rolls-Royce models are unlikely to come online for at least a decade. Along with being a tool for hitting ambitious emissions targets, the government views the small nuclear program as a way to deliver on its promise to generate jobs in northern England, where, Rolls-Royce said, much of the investment will be based. The government also hopes to create an export industry supplying such plants to other countries. Britain, though, is likely to encounter competition from France, which recently announced its own small reactor program, and the United States, where operators are working on similar concepts. Last week, NuScale Power, based in Portland, Ore., announced an agreement to build small modular reactors in Romania. ADVERTISEMENT Despite risks from accidents, nuclear energy is attracting new interest in Europe and elsewhere as a tool for countries to hit increasingly ambitious targets to reduce the carbon emissions responsible for climate change. Nuclear plants are valued for providing large amounts of low-carbon electricity. Rolls-Royce’s work with nuclear power includes designing the reactors aboard Britain’s nuclear submarines, work that began in the 1950s."
" GLASGOW — Speaker Nancy Pelosi and nearly two dozen House Democrats barnstormed global climate talks here on Tuesday, claiming that “America is back” in the effort to slow global warming, even as their party remains divided over a $1.85 trillion budget bill upon which their climate agenda depends. Ms. Pelosi noted that she was accompanied by a record number of lawmakers attending a U.N. climate summit and said they had flown to Glasgow “ready to take on the challenge, to meet the moment.” But they haven’t yet. The stalled legislation includes $555 billion in tax credits and incentives to promote wind and solar power, electric vehicles, climate-friendly agriculture and forestry programs, and a host of other clean-energy programs. Those measures would bring the country about halfway to Mr. Biden’s goal of cutting the country’s greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 52 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. ADVERTISEMENT Ms. Pelosi said it would be “the most ambitious and consequential climate and clean energy investment of all time.” She said House lawmakers intended to pass that bill next week, but a handful of moderate Democrats in the House have raised concerns about its price tag. Meanwhile, the legislation has been held up in the Senate largely because of objections of one Democratic senator, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia. Mr. Manchin’s state is a coal and gas producer, he has personal financial ties to the coal industry and has said he opposes policies that would harm fossil fuels. Ms. Pelosi noted that last week the Congress had approved a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill that includes billions of dollars to help fortify communities against the impacts of climate disasters. But the money and policies to cut the emissions that are causing global warming are embedded in the legislation that has yet to pass. In a series of meetings and speeches, lawmakers said they felt the weight of expectations from the rest of the world. Of all nations, the United States has pumped the most carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere — pollution that is trapping heat and driving up average global temperatures. ADVERTISEMENT It has also promised to act on climate change only to fall short several times over the past decades. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York Democrat who was among the lawmakers traveling with Ms. Pelosi, said countries should hold the U.S. to account for its promise to significantly reduce emissions from the burning of coal, oil and gas. “We have to actually deliver to get the respect internationally,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. “We have to draw down emissions in order to get credit for being committed on climate change.”    Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, was surrounded by security as she walked the cavernous tented hallways of the summit, quickly drawing the attention of a crowd of activists who wore masks declaring themselves “climate feminists.” Representative Sean Casten, Democrat of Illinois, said Congress had been making “excuses” for inaction on climate change ever since the Clinton administration accepted the world’s first global climate treaty, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, only to see the Senate fail to ratify it. “The rest of the world is sitting there and saying, ‘We’ve heard this story before. Your words are beautiful but we’re watching your feet,’” Mr. Casten said, adding, “All of us are going to be furious if the Senate drops the ball,” on the $1.85 trillion package. There is an outsized level of attention in Glasgow to political machinations over the legislation pending in Washington. One activist on Tuesday who followed Ms. Ocasio-Cortez through the halls at the summit, Pamela Elizarraras, 24, from Mexico, said it had been frustrating to watch the climate legislation flounder. ADVERTISEMENT “They have so much power,” Ms. Elizarraras said of the United States, adding, “It’s really important for them to really step it up.” An earlier wave of lawmakers traveled to Glasgow last week to make a similar argument that the United States was back in the climate fight, after four years of global disengagement under the Trump administration. That group was heavily Democratic but included a handful of Republican House members and a lone Republican Senator, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. The Republicans said they may disagree with Mr. Biden’s policies but they were concerned about climate change, even if they did not support a move away from fossil fuels, which scientists say is needed to avert climate catastrophe. “Republicans care deeply about this earth,” Representative John Curtis, Republican of Utah, said. “We may not have learned how to talk about it,” he said, “but I promise you we care and we’re serious about being part of the solution.” Other Republican attendees in Glasgow included Representatives Dan Crenshaw of Texas; Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa; and representatives from conservative groups. ADVERTISEMENT Ms. Murkowski, in an interview, said she, like other Republicans, did not intend to vote for the $1.85 trillion bill that contains the president’s climate agenda. But she said she did not object to clean-energy tax credits, calling them a “safe zone” of climate policy. The presence of Republicans was a shift from 12 years ago when Senator James Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, traveled solo to a U.N. climate conference in Copenhagen to object to climate science and declare “there’s not a chance in the world” America will pass legislation to tackle global warming. Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, said at the summit he has been encouraged by the number of Republican lawmakers who are willing to discuss serious climate policy. The bottom line, though, is that United States needs to reduce the use of fossil fuels, he said. “If you don’t agree on that, then you’re playing word games,” Mr. Schatz said. President Biden has made climate action central to his presidency. If the pending legislation passes, analysts say, it will get the United States about halfway to the president’s targets. The rest will depend on a combination of things that are outside of Mr. Biden’s control, like the markets and regulations that could be overturned by the courts or reversed by a future administration Michael S. Regan, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said in an interview Tuesday that he would begin to announce before the end of the year a“suite” of new policies to draw down emissions from electric utilities. After transportation, the power sector is the second-largest source of emissions in the United States. The Supreme Court is poised to weigh whether the E.P.A. has the authority to regulate the emissions of greenhouse gases. The decision from the conservative-leaning court could deliver a blow to the agency’s ability to tackle climate change. Mr. Regan said he was not planning to wait for a ruling before issuing new power plant regulations. “We have pens to paper right now,” he said. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said the United States and other developed nations must take even greater action on global warming. ADVERTISEMENT “We’re here to push,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. “It’s time for us to re-examine our first-world and global governments, to re-examine their priorities about what is possible, and really try to push them on the boundaries of that.” She credited activists with pressuring the Biden administration to be more ambitious on climate change and talked about her own role protesting the development of gas pipelines in places like Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in South Dakota. Tuesday was “gender day” at the summit, and Ms. Pelosi noted that women faced particular dangers in a warming world. Climate change “is the existential threat of our time,” she said. “It’s a threat multiplier that amplifies and accelerates existing inequities. Eighty percent of people displaced by climate change globally are women.” Outside the climate summit the streets of Glasgow have been filled with protesters, many of them young women. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said she hoped to spend some time with the activists while in Glasgow and thinks their presence has kept the pressure on the decision makers. And she had a message for them: “Stay in the streets, and keep pushing,” she said with a wink."
" [Follow our latest coverage of the COP26 climate change summit.] LAGOS, Nigeria — The staff at Big Cabal, a media start-up, wanted to ditch its diesel generator, but needed something to keep the office air-conditioners running. The generator was noisy, expensive and, maybe worst of all, bad for the environment. Hoping for a greener solution to its problem, Big Cabal in 2019 bought solar panels for its two-story office building. But the leap to solar didn’t go according to plan — and the reasons illuminate the big challenges Africa faces from climate change. The region is rich in fossil fuels and is eager to use them to fix its notoriously unreliable power grids. But to slow global warming, nations must burn less oil and gas, not more. Meantime, Africa is heating up much faster than the rest of the world. For starters, Big Cabal found that the solar panels cost about three times more than the generator in maintenance costs. And, even though the company’s finance manager, Sophia Abu, scouted for the most powerful units the company could afford, they still weren’t quite enough to run the air-conditioners. So while Big Cabal’s staff, who write technology and culture news, sweltered in the summer heat, the AC units hummed cheerfully and pushed out warm air. ADVERTISEMENT “We’ve had to buy more batteries, and more panels,” Ms. Abu said, as well as special air-conditioners that work with solar inverters, devices that can accommodate battery storage. Now, the diesel generator is back, screaming behind the office. The company switches between power from the local utility, the generator and the solar panels. That juggling act gets to the heart of a big question facing African nations: Who gets to keep using fossil fuels, and for how long, during the transition to clean energy? ADVERTISEMENT “When they say cut in Africa, what do they want to cut?” asked Titus Gwemende, Zimbabwe-based climate director at the Open Society Foundation, a grants organization. “There’s nothing to cut here. African countries are the ones on the receiving end of this problem. It’s the bigger emitters that should have the responsibility to cut,” he said. “We should be sensitive to history.” A swift transition is crucial in the global fight against climate change. But not only would that be particularly costly in poorer nations, many African countries have an abundance of fossil fuels, including natural gas, and they argue forcefully that the rest of the world doesn’t have a right to tell Africa not to use those resources. Proven crude oil reserves on the African continent total more than one hundred billion barrels spanning eleven countries, with Libya and Nigeria among the 10 biggest producers globally. The region is rich in gas, too: Combined, Nigeria, Algeria and Mozambique hold about 6 percent of the world’s natural gas reserves. As world leaders meet at COP26 in Glasgow, some African leaders and activists are, for the first time, vocally opposing a speedier pivot to renewables for their countries. Instead, they are pressing for a slower transition, one that would embrace a continued reliance on fossil fuels — particularly natural gas, which burns more cleanly than coal or oil, but which still pumps planet-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Their calls come at an awkward time. This year alone, scientists and researchers have issued numerous reports showing the damage that the widespread burning of fossil fuels has caused to the climate over the decades. The scientific findings highlight the urgency of switching to cleaner energy if the world is to prevent global temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius from preindustrial times, a target set by the Paris accord, the agreement among nations to slow climate change. Beyond that temperature threshold, scientists say, the risk of calamities like deadly heat waves, water shortages and ecosystem collapse grows sharply. But in order to hit that target and avert the worst climate catastrophes, analysts here say, African nations should be supported financially by wealthier ones as they seek alternative pathways to reducing emissions.  When the time comes, Mr. Gwemende said, developed countries should also transfer technical knowledge on renewables to Africa. ADVERTISEMENT Insisting that African countries transition more swiftly to renewables, some analysts say, is akin to developed nations using a ladder to climb a wall, then pulling it up before developing countries can do the same. Under growing pressure to act, development banks and richer countries alike have been rolling back their support for fossil fuel projects like coal-burning power plants. In 2017, the World Bank cut funding for projects like these and began to invest more in renewable energy projects. And in Glasgow, rich countries like Britain, the United States, Canada and Denmark have pledged to stop spending on fossil fuel projects abroad by 2022, barring some exemptions.     So far, at least one gas project in Mozambique, a gas-rich country in southern Africa, will not be going ahead according to the Africa Energy Chamber, an advisory firm. The oil giant BP has said it will roll back its oil and gas production, including on the continent. African leaders are voicing their displeasure. In several seminars at the Glasgow climate conference, as well as in opinion pieces in recent months, they’ve taken sharp jabs at these cutbacks. “Efforts to restrict fossil fuel investments in Africa are even harder to stomach because many of the wealthy countries behind them — including Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States — include natural gas in their own multidecade plans to transition to clean energy,” Yemi Osinbajo, Nigeria’s vice president, wrote in Foreign Affairs in the run-up to the talks, known as COP26. ADVERTISEMENT Nigeria depends largely on gas for electricity, and on crude for revenue. “Climate action shouldn’t mean strangling all fossil fuel projects but rather facilitating the flow of capital to the countries that need it most,” Mr. Osinbajo wrote. Sub-Saharan Africa contributes about 3 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, among the lowest of the world’s regions. Yet African countries are particularly hard hit by the consequences of climate change. The region is warming faster than the global average and experiencing bigger increases in sea-level rise. Parts of East Africa haven’t seen rain in years and are battling droughts. The Sahel region of West Africa has recorded a sharp rise in conflicts between farmers and herders caused by vegetation loss. And in southern Madagascar, families are boiling cactus leaves for food in what the United Nations is calling one of the world’s first famines induced by climate change. Yet, at the same time, the development stakes are particularly high for the continent, which is home to some 1.2 billion people, half of whom don’t have access to electricity — a group  equivalent to the entire population of the European Union. The problems in electrification are wide-ranging and vary from country to country: Absence of power-generating capacity, absence of technical expertise, and widespread corruption. There are plans, under the African Union, to rely largely on renewables by 2050 but only a handful of countries like South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia and Morocco have high renewable capacities presently. ADVERTISEMENT In the Lagos office, a ding announces a power cut. But the lights quickly blink on again, as the solar system takes over. Big Cabal’s employees have settled into a routine with their complex mix of electricity sources. But it required much time and money. It’s that time and money that African leaders say the continent needs more of, in order to make a transition to renewable power. Renewable technologies are expensive in almost all regions, but, on top of those costs, African countries also face the expenses of industrializing, providing better health care and building food and education systems. However, getting world leaders to agree to keep funding oil and gas projects could prove difficult. In Glasgow, Britain and other rich countries have pledged to fund Africa with billions of dollars to increase warning systems, protect vulnerable communities in the Sahel, and, for coal-reliant South Africa, to help speed the transition to clean energy. But some are not enthusiastic about the new announcements. The same countries promised $100 billion annually in 2009 to developing countries, but those funds have been slow to come. The announcements are only a first step, said Lily Odarno of the Clean Air Task Force, a Washington nonprofit. Until the money arrives, she said, “it’s better to wait and see.” Meanwhile, the U.N’s environmental agency says developing countries spend about $70 billion on adaptation costs — responding to floods and droughts, for example — annually. Sidelining Africa’s concerns could have consequences, analysts say. Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to see doubled population growth rates by 2050 and Nigeria will overtake the United States to become the third-most-populous country in the world. Africa also has the fastest urban growth rate in the world. By 2050, these populations are likely to be using up a lot of energy, whether it is clean or not. ADVERTISEMENT Some analysts argue that Africa’s leaders should, in fact, make faster progress on renewable energy, citing in particular the continent’s huge solar potential. Happy Khambule, a senior political adviser with Greenpeace Africa, said his organization rejected the calls to continue using fossil fuels on the continent and equated it with “burning up the house we all live in.” But overall, the message from African leaders at this month’s Glasgow climate talks is that the continent should be able to stick with some fossil fuels as part of the transition, considering the region’s economic and historic realities. “It will be a successful COP if the bulk of the action is done by countries outside the continent,” Mr. Gwemende, of Open Society Foundation, said. “It will be successful if the monies are dispensed by the big emitters. But our work should go beyond COP. There’s more work to do after.”"
" [Follow our latest coverage of the COP26 climate change summit.] More than 40 countries have pledged to cut greenhouse-gas emissions across their health systems, World Health Organization officials said late Monday, representing the largest global effort to date to try to reduce contributions by the world’s hospitals and health care industry to global warming. “This announcement is huge,” said Josh Karliner, the international director of program and strategy at Health Care Without Harm, a nonprofit that has worked to reduce the environmental impact of the health care sector. It is designed to put the industry on a path toward “net zero” emissions of greenhouse gases, he said, and “what it implies is that the way health care is provided is going to be fundamentally transformed.” The governments of 42 countries have said they will lower their emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas that is warming the world, across their health systems. Twelve countries have pledged to reach net zero carbon dioxide emissions before 2050. The pledges have come from high-income countries including the United States, Britain and Germany, as well as several low- and middle-income countries that are already among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, such as the Bahamas, Fiji and the Maldives. ADVERTISEMENT The health care sector accounts for almost five percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. If it were a country, it would be the fifth largest emitter. Many of the pledges represent initial commitments that will need to be bolstered with more specific details on how the goals might be achieved. At this week’s global climate summit in Glasgow, the issue of public health has taken on a higher profile than at any previous United Nations climate conference. For the first time there is a dedicated health pavilion, and a series of panels, speeches, and lectures outlining the effects of climate change on health. They included emotional pleas by mothers of children suffering from air pollution, including Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, who spoke with Alok Sharma, the head of the conference, on Friday and whose daughter’s death from asthma was attributed to air pollution. There have also been presentations of new technologies, including the introduction of a zero-emissions ambulance. ADVERTISEMENT There is already a sizable body of research showing that climate change is contributing to a wide range of health risks around the world. It is exacerbating heat waves, intensifying wildfires, heightening flood risks and worsening droughts. These are, in turn, increasing heat-related mortality, pregnancy complications and cardiovascular disease. And as with many things climate-related, the risks and harms are particularly severe in places that are the least able to respond. The United States, which accounts for more than a quarter of health-sector carbon dioxide emissions globally, joined in the commitment to clean up its health sector. Admiral Rachel Levine, the assistant secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, said the government would reduce emissions at federal health facilities, which could include those operated by the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, and would provide incentives, guidance and assistance to privately operated health facilities to make similar reductions. Nineteen private health care systems in the United States have already committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. The Biden Administration has said that by 2030 the United States will aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 52 percent from 2005 levels across the economy. Health care accounts for 8.5 percent of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. The federal Health and Human Services department said it planned to lay out more details Tuesday morning in a public statement in Glasgow. Carrying out these commitments will require countries to significantly retool their health care sectors. For high income countries, that would include making the health care sector more energy efficient and less wasteful, but also would likely require the transformation of overall energy grids to supply clean energy. For low- and middle-income countries, whose populations may not have regular access to health care or where health care facilities don’t have reliable energy, it will likely require building new and greener facilities at the same time as they are expanding health care coverage. ADVERTISEMENT In a closed-door meeting on Monday, international funders including USAID, the World Bank, and the Green Climate Fund had an initial conversation about how they would support the commitments made by low- and middle-income countries. “In the midst of the pandemic, we had to recover from extreme weather events and manage the resulting health impacts,” said Ifereimi Waqainabete, Fiji’s Minister for Health and Medical Services, in a statement. It “has shown us that health systems and facilities are the main line of defense in protecting populations from emerging threats.”"
" GLASGOW — Former President Barack Obama, who helped to seal the Paris climate agreement six years ago, returned to an international climate summit here to rally nations to heal the planet, acknowledging the enormous complexity of the crisis but arguing that humanity has the capacity to create a safer, healthier world. “To be honest with ourselves, yes, this is going to be really hard,” said Mr. Obama, who was welcomed with sustained applause by delegates from nearly 200 nations. “The thing we have going for us, is that humanity has done hard things before. I believe we can do hard things again.” Mr. Obama noted that the Paris agreement, signed by 197 countries in 2015, created a framework for climate action, but nations, including the United States, failed to follow through on their commitments to keep global warming within relatively safe margins. “Important work was done there, and important work is being done here,” he said. “That is the good news. Now, for the bad news. We are nowhere near where we need to be.” ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Obama’s appearance at the summit was greeted with enormous enthusiasm, with a large crowd straining to catch a glimpse of the former president, phones held aloft to snap a photo as he walked into the hall. He received a standing ovation after his address. At each of several events, Mr. Obama emphasized the power of activism, particularly from young people, in pushing countries and companies to address the climate crisis. “The most important energy in this movement is coming from young people,” he said. “And the reason is simple. They have more at stake in this than anybody else.” He said he understood the psychic weight carried by younger generations, and the anger that many feel about inheriting a world where storms have become more ferocious and frequent, heat waves more deadly, where species are disappearing and the future feels frightening. “I’m the father of two daughters in their early 20s,” he said. “It’s not always easy being young today. For most of your lives, if you’re in that generation, you’ve been bombarded about what the future will look like if we don’t do anything about climate change. And you’ve grown up watching the adults either act like the problem doesn’t exist or don’t do anything about it. It’s a real source of anxiety and some of you no doubt wonder if you’ll be safe.” ADVERTISEMENT And he acknowledged that he, too, sometimes felt overwhelmed. “There are times where I feel discouraged, there are times when the future seems somewhat bleak, there are times when I am doubtful that humanity can get its act together before it’s too late,” he said. “Images of dystopia creep into my dreams.” But, he cautioned, “cynicism is the recourse of cowards. We can’t afford hopelessness.” For Mr. Obama, Glasgow also amounted to a kind of redemption tour. After witnessing his legacy on climate policy ruthlessly undone by his successor, Donald J. Trump, Mr. Obama was able to represent a United States that was once again at the table, to tackle a global problem that it has had such a big hand in making. Mr. Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris accord, which Mr. Obama had played a significant role in brokering, and unwound more than 100 of Mr. Obama’s environmental regulations. On Monday, he called Mr. Trump’s tenure “four years of active hostility toward climate science, coming from very top of our government.” But Mr. Obama’s presence at the summit was also a reminder that the United States has often failed to keep its promises on tackling climate change. He was reminded of this even before he began speaking Monday, with some young activists criticizing the United States for not paying its fair share of financial aid to help poor countries address climate change. The activist Vanessa Nakate wrote on Twitter that she was 13 when Mr. Obama promised that the countries of the global north would provide $100 billion in climate financing a year by 2020. That money hasn’t yet materialized. “The US has broken that promise, it will cost lives in Africa,” she tweeted. “You want to meet #COP26 youth. We want action.” ADVERTISEMENT To the extent President Biden has been able to restore Mr. Obama’s climate agenda, it has been through diplomatic moves, like rejoining the Paris Agreement, or through legislation that, if it wins passage, will do so almost entirely on Democratic votes because Republicans have withheld support. “One of our two major parties has decided not only to sit on the sidelines, but express active hostility toward climate science and make climate change a partisan issue,” Mr. Obama said. “Saving the planet isn’t a partisan issue,” he said, adding that politics don’t matter “if your Florida house is flooded by rising seas, or your crops fail in the Dakotas or your California house is burning down. Nature, science do not care about party affiliation.” His agenda was carefully curated. In addition to a plenary address, Mr. Obama spoke to leaders of several island countries already feeling the acute impacts of climate change, emphasizing the need for money to help vulnerable countries adapt to a hotter planet. He joined a closed-door meeting with a bloc of countries that call themselves the High Ambition Coalition and ended his day with a round table with young advocates, organized by the Obama Foundation along with Columbia Climate School. At the round table event in the late afternoon, a large group of students waited at the entrance to see his arrival at the University of Strathclyde. An even larger group gathered near the gates when he left, nearly two hours later. Luisa Neubauer, 25, a leader of the Fridays for the Future movement in Germany, who was part of the round table, said afterward that it was a positive sign that the United States, under Mr. Biden, was making new pledges, though she felt it hadn’t been honest about its past failings. “Young people, me included, we are very reluctant to be hopeful just because a new leader makes a promise or a former president goes around making promises,” she said. “Because we have been betrayed again and again.” During the summit, young people have filled the streets of Glasgow and around the world to demand more ambitious action on climate change from their leaders. Mr. Obama urged them to keep up the pressure and to “stay angry.” ADVERTISEMENT “The cold hard fact is, we will not have more ambitious climate plans coming out of governments unless governments feel some pressure from voters,” he said. “Don’t think you can ignore politics,” Mr. Obama said. “You don’t have to be happy about it. But you can’t ignore it. You can’t be too pure for it. ” He also cautioned them on the limits of protests and what he called “hashtag campaigns.” “Protests are necessary. Hashtag campaigns can spread awareness. But to build the broad-based coalitions necessary for bold action, we will have to persuade people who either don’t currently agree with us or are simply indifferent,” he said in his plenary address. “There are workers and communities that still depend on coal for power and jobs, and are more concerned about maintaining their wages now than they are about a warmer planet ten or twenty years from now.” Mr. Obama said Monday that rich industrialized countries like the United States had “an added burden” to aid nations at the front lines of climate impacts. The Biden administration has pledged $11.4 billion in climate aid over the next few years, with roughly a fourth of that for adaptation, though that money still requires congressional approval. “Those of us who live in big wealthy nations, those of us who helped to precipitate the problem, we have an added burden to make sure that we are working with and helping and assisting those who are less responsible and less able and more vulnerable to this oncoming crisis,” Mr. Obama said. For decades, many of the most vulnerable countries have pressed for reparations from rich industrialized countries, as part of what they call a loss and damage fund. The United States and other rich countries have long been reluctant to agree to anything that opens them up to liability. The Marshall Islands said it would need “tens of billions” of dollars for adaptation, including to elevate its territory and move its people away from harm’s way. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Obama urged the delegates to keep pushing forward, turning to Shakespeare for inspiration about the pace of progress. “What wound, he writes, did ever heal but by degrees?” Mr. Obama said in his plenary address. “Our planet has been wounded by our actions,” he said. “Those wounds won’t be healed today or tomorrow or the next. But they can be healed by degrees. If we start with that spirit, if each of us can fight through the occasional frustration and the dread, if we do our part and follow through our commitment, I believe we can secure our future. We have to. And what a profound and noble task we have set for ourselves.” Mark Landler contributed reporting."
" GLASGOW — The international climate summit here has been billed by its chief organizer as the “last, best hope” to save the planet. But as the United Nations conference enters its second week and negotiators from 197 countries knuckle down to finalize a new agreement to tackle global warming, attendees were sharply divided over how much progress is being made. There’s the optimistic view: Heads of state and titans of industry showed up in force last week with splashy new climate promises, a sign that momentum was building in the right direction. “I believe what is happening here is far from business as usual,” said John Kerry, President Biden’s special envoy on climate change, who has been attending U.N. climate summits since 1992. “I have never counted as many initiatives and as much real money — real money — being put on the table.” For example, 105 countries agreed to cut emissions of methane, a potent planet-warming gas, by 30 percent this decade. Another 130 countries vowed to halt deforestation by 2030 and commit billions of dollars toward the effort. India for the first time joined the growing chorus of nations pledging to reach “net zero” emissions, setting a 2070 deadline to stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. ADVERTISEMENT Then there’s the pessimistic view: All these gauzy promises mean little without concrete plans to follow through. And that’s still lacking. Or, as the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg put it, the conference has mostly consisted of “blah, blah, blah.” Malik Amin Aslam, an adviser to the prime minister of Pakistan, scoffed at some of the distant net zero goals being announced, including India’s: “With an average age of 60, I don’t think anyone in the negotiating room would live to experience that net zero in 2070,” he said. On Monday, former President Barack Obama arrived at the summit to rally leaders. “Yes, the process will be messy,” he said. “I guarantee you every victory will be incomplete. Sometimes, we will be forced to settle for imperfect compromises. But at least they advance the ball down the field. If we work hard enough, for long enough, those partial victories add up.” ADVERTISEMENT Critics noted that some of last week’s announcements turned out to be full of caveats. After signing the forest pledge, officials in Indonesia, home to the world’s third-largest rainforest, clarified that ending deforestation in their country by 2030 at the expense of economic development was “obviously inappropriate and unfair.” Another vow by more than 40 countries to phase out coal power featured vague timelines and left out major coal users like China, India and the United States. “The actual negotiations here are in danger of being drowned out by a blitz of news releases that get great headlines, but are often less than meets the eye,” said Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa, a research institute based in Kenya. “There’s a lot of good talk and less real action.” Mr. Adow said the summit should be judged on whether all 197 parties can craft a detailed, formal agreement that holds governments accountable for the promises they make. That would mean reaching consensus on wonky but crucial questions like how often nations should strengthen their near-term plans to cut emissions, the amount and type of financial aid that rich countries should give poorer ones to cope with the mounting dangers of climate change, and how to regulate the booming global market in carbon offsets. Behind closed doors, negotiators are still debating key issues as they seek to expand and update the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement. By tradition, a final agreement requires every single country to sign on — if any one of them objects, talks can deadlock. How these disputes get resolved by the time the summit ends on Friday could determine the success of the Glasgow talks. “The reality is you’ve got two different truths going on,” said Helen Mountford, vice president for climate and economics at the World Resources Institute. “We’ve made much more progress than we ever could’ve imagined a couple years ago. But it’s still nowhere near enough.” When the conference opened last Monday, the U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, said the top priority must be to limit the rise in global temperatures to just 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels. That’s the threshold, scientists have warned, beyond which the risk of calamities like deadly heat waves, water shortages and ecosystem collapse grows immensely. (The world has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius.) ADVERTISEMENT Countries are all but certain to leave Glasgow short of achieving that goal. The big question is whether the lofty pledges this week, along with a new formal agreement, can push them further along. When analysts at the United Nations tallied up all of the formal plans that nations have submitted so far to curb emissions over the next decade, they estimated that the world was on track to heat up roughly 2.7 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by 2100. That’s both an improvement over where things stood a decade ago and also far off-track. To limit warming to just 1.5 degrees Celsius, the U.N. said, global emissions from fossil fuels need to plummet by roughly half between 2010 and 2030. Instead, emissions are set to rise over that period. “Recent climate action announcements might give the impression that we are on track to turn things around,” Mr. Guterres said last week. “This is an illusion.” On Thursday, however, the International Energy Agency offered a more hopeful picture. If you factor in some of the longer term, less-detailed promises that countries have made recently — including pledges to reach net zero emissions by most of the world’s biggest economies, as well as the new agreement to cut methane — then the world could potentially keep warming to as low as 1.8 degrees Celsius by 2100. “I certainly never thought we’d get to next Friday confidently on track to 1.5 degrees, but if we can break the two-degree barrier, I think psychologically that will be huge and maybe give us more of a collective belief that we can go faster,” said Nigel Topping, chosen by the U.N. as its “high level climate action champion.” Yet many environmentalists remained skeptical of the International Energy Agency’s projection. ADVERTISEMENT “It’s assuming that countries like Australia and Saudi Arabia will get there by 2050, simply because they’ve said they will,” said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International. “When in reality they haven’t put in place the funding or policies to make this happen.” One issue being debated this week is whether countries should have to come back to the United Nations more frequently, perhaps annually, with stronger short-term plans to cut emissions. At the moment, governments aren’t expected to submit new pledges until 2025. “That’s a bit too late for many countries to strengthen their pledges for this decade, since they’ll have built a lot of fossil-fuel infrastructure by then and will have locked in additional emissions,” said Jennifer Tollmann, an analyst for E3G, a climate research group. Sabra Ibrahim Noordeen is the climate envoy for the Maldives, an archipelago of low-lying islands in the Indian Ocean that has been inhabited for thousands of years but could be inundated within three generations because of rising seas. She said countries like hers were depending on the summit to get it right. “Please get us to 1.5,” she said. Even more contentious is the question of money, which has long been a big sticking point in global climate talks. A decade ago, the world’s wealthiest nations pledged to mobilize $100 billion per year by 2020 to help poorer countries transition to cleaner energy and protect themselves against the growing dangers from heat waves, floods, droughts and wildfires as the planet heats up. So far, those promises have not been met. By one estimate, wealthy countries are still falling short by tens of billions of dollars per year. And critics have said that even this money has been poorly targeted. A large fraction of aid to date has been handed out as loans, which developing countries often struggle to repay. And only a tiny sliver of financing has gone toward efforts to adapt to climate change. ADVERTISEMENT As the dangers from extreme weather rise, vulnerable countries say their financial needs are soaring. Sonam P. Wangdi, who leads a bloc of 47 nations known as the Least Developed Countries, pointed out that his home country of Bhutan bears little responsibility for global warming, since the nation currently absorbs more carbon dioxide from its vast forests than it emits from its cars and homes. Nonetheless, Bhutan faces severe risks from rising temperatures, with melting glaciers in the Himalayas already creating flash floods and mudslides that have devastated villages. “We have contributed the least to this problem yet we suffer disproportionately,” Mr. Wangdi said. “There must be increasing support for adapting to impacts.” At the same time, vulnerable countries are arguing for a separate funding mechanism to help compensate them for disasters that they can’t adapt to, often referred to as “loss and damage.” But that proposal faces opposition from wealthier countries, which fear it could open the door to future compensation claims. “So far the progress here is disappointing, and in a way frightening,” Mr. Wangdi said. “Our lives depend on decisions made here in Glasgow.” Outside the conference center over the weekend, tens of thousands of protesters marched in lashing rains and bitter winds to urge countries to take more forceful measures to combat climate change. ADVERTISEMENT Others at the summit argued that it was unrealistic to expect a single conference to solve global warming. The Paris agreement was intended to add transparency to countries’ climate plans and ratchet up pressure on world leaders to do more. But ultimately, the real test would be whether policymakers and businesses and activists make that vision a reality back home. “The day after Glasgow ends, there’s still going to be a lot of work to do,” said Kaveh Guilanpour, a vice president at the Center for Energy and Climate Solutions who has worked as a negotiator for various parties at past summits. “A new agreement could set the foundations for what comes next, but it’s up to all of us to maintain pressure after that. The problem is not going to be fixed in one go.” “We may not really know how successful Glasgow was,” he added, “until a couple of years down the road.”"
" GLASGOW, Escocia — Esta cumbre climática internacional ha sido catalogada por su principal organizador como “la última y mejor esperanza” para salvar el planeta. Pero ahora que la conferencia de Naciones Unidas entra en su segunda semana y los negociadores de 197 países trabajan arduamente con el objetivo de finalizar un nuevo acuerdo para combatir el calentamiento global, los asistentes siguen teniendo opiniones muy distintas sobre cuántos avances se están logrando. Existe la visión optimista: los jefes de Estado y titanes de la industria se presentaron con fuerza la semana pasada con nuevas y llamativas promesas climáticas, y eso es una señal de que se está generando un impulso en la dirección correcta. “Creo que lo que está sucediendo aquí está lejos de ser lo mismo de siempre”, dijo John Kerry, enviado especial del presidente Joe Biden sobre el cambio climático, quien ha asistido a las cumbres climáticas de la ONU desde 1992. “Nunca he contado tantas iniciativas y tanto dinero real —dinero de verdad— sobre la mesa”. ADVERTISEMENT Por ejemplo, 105 países acordaron reducir un 30 por ciento las emisiones de metano, un potente gas que calienta el planeta, durante esta década. Otros 130 países prometieron detener la deforestación para 2030 y destinar miles de millones de dólares para lograrlo. Por primera vez, India se unió al creciente coro de naciones que se han comprometido a alcanzar las “cero emisiones netas”, y ha establecido como fecha límite el año 2070 para dejar de liberar gases de efecto invernadero a la atmósfera. Luego está la visión pesimista: todas estas promesas ambiciosas significan muy poco sin planes concretos para hacerlas realidad. Y eso sigue faltando. O, como dijo la activista sueca Greta Thunberg, la conferencia ha consistido principalmente en puro “bla, bla, bla”. Malik Amin Aslam, asesor del primer ministro de Pakistán, se burló de algunos de los distantes objetivos de cero emisiones que se anunciaron, entre ellos el de India. “Con una edad promedio de 60 años, dudo que alguien en la sala de negociaciones esté vivo para experimentar ese cero neto en 2070”, dijo. El lunes, el expresidente Barack Obama llegó a la cumbre para animar a los líderes. “Sí, el proceso será complicado”, declaró. “Les garantizo que cada victoria será incompleta. A veces nos veremos obligados a conformarnos con concesiones imperfectas. Pero al menos eso hará avanzar la pelota por el campo. Si trabajamos con el suficiente empeño, durante el tiempo suficiente, esas victorias parciales se sumarán”. ADVERTISEMENT Los críticos señalaron que algunos de los anuncios de la semana pasada resultaron estar llenos de salvedades. Después de firmar el compromiso forestal, los funcionarios de Indonesia, país que alberga la tercera selva tropical más grande del mundo, aclararon que ponerle fin a la deforestación en su país para 2030 a expensas del desarrollo económico era “a todas luces inapropiado e injusto”. Otra promesa realizada por más de 40 países para eliminar de forma gradual la energía generada por carbón presentó plazos vagos y dejó de lado a los mayores usuarios de carbón como China, India y Estados Unidos. “Las negociaciones reales que se están dando corren el riesgo de ser ahogadas por una avalancha de comunicados de prensa que obtienen vistosos titulares, pero que suelen ser menos de lo que parecen”, afirmó Mohamed Adow, director de Power Shift Africa, un instituto de investigación con sede en Kenia. “Hay muchas buenas conversaciones y no tantas acciones reales”. Adow dijo que la cumbre debe juzgarse en función de si los 197 participantes logran diseñar un acuerdo formal y detallado que responsabilice a los gobiernos por las promesas que hacen. Eso significaría llegar a un consenso sobre cuestiones difusas pero cruciales como la frecuencia con la que las naciones deberían fortalecer sus planes a corto plazo para reducir las emisiones, la cantidad y el tipo de ayuda financiera que los países ricos deberían otorgarles a los más pobres para que enfrenten los crecientes peligros del cambio climático, y cómo regular el floreciente mercado mundial de compensaciones de carbono. A puerta cerrada, los negociadores siguen debatiendo temas claves mientras buscan ampliar y actualizar el histórico acuerdo climático de París de 2015. Por tradición, un acuerdo final requiere que todos los países firmen; si alguno de ellos se opone, las conversaciones pueden estancarse. La cumbre finaliza el viernes, y la forma en que se resuelvan estas disputas podría determinar el éxito de las conversaciones de Glasgow. “La realidad es que hay dos verdades diferentes”, dijo Helen Mountford, vicepresidenta de asuntos climáticos y económicos del Instituto de Recursos Mundiales. “Hemos progresado mucho más de lo que hubiéramos imaginado hace un par de años. Pero seguimos estando muy lejos de lo necesario”. ADVERTISEMENT En la inauguración de la conferencia el 1 de noviembre, el secretario general de la ONU, António Guterres, declaró que la máxima prioridad debía ser limitar el aumento de las temperaturas globales a solo 1,5 grados Celsius por encima de los niveles preindustriales. Los científicos han advertido que superar ese umbral hará crecer inmensamente el riesgo de calamidades como olas de calor letales, escasez de agua y colapsos de ecosistemas (el mundo ya se ha calentado 1,1 grados Celsius). Es casi seguro que los países se irán de Glasgow sin lograr ese objetivo. La gran pregunta es si las loables promesas de esta semana, junto con un nuevo acuerdo formal, podrán acercarlos a la meta. Cuando los analistas de la ONU contabilizaron todos los planes formales que las naciones han presentado hasta el momento para frenar las emisiones durante la próxima década, estimaron que el mundo estaba perfilado a calentarse cerca de 2,7 grados Celsius por encima de los niveles preindustriales para 2100. A pesar de que es una mejora con respecto a la situación de hace una década, sigue siendo un resultado muy alejado del objetivo necesario. Para limitar el calentamiento a solo 1,5 grados Celsius, declaró la ONU, las emisiones globales de combustibles fósiles deben desplomarse a cerca de la mitad entre 2010 y 2030. En cambio, está previsto que las emisiones aumenten durante ese periodo. “Los anuncios recientes de acción climática podrían dar la impresión de que vamos rumbo a cambiar las cosas”, dijo Guterres la semana pasada. “Eso es una ilusión”. Sin embargo, el jueves 4 de noviembre la Agencia Internacional de la Energía ofreció un panorama más esperanzador. Si se tienen en cuenta algunas de las promesas más a largo plazo y menos detalladas que los países han hecho en los últimos tiempos —incluidos los compromisos de alcanzar las cero emisiones netas por parte de la mayoría de las economías más grandes del mundo, así como un nuevo acuerdo para reducir el uso de metano— el mundo podría mantener el calentamiento a un mínimo de 1,8 grados Celsius para 2100. “Sin duda jamás pensé que llegaríamos al próximo viernes con paso firme rumbo al objetivo de los 1,5 grados Celsius, pero si logramos romper la barrera de los 2 grados, creo que será algo muy valioso, a nivel psicológico, y quizás nos dé una mayor convicción colectiva de que podemos acelerar las acciones”, comentó Nigel Topping, elegido por la ONU como su “campeón de acción climática de alto nivel”. ADVERTISEMENT Sin embargo, muchos ambientalistas se mostraron escépticos ante la proyección de la Agencia Internacional de la Energía. “Eso es asumir que países como Australia y Arabia Saudita lograrán esos objetivos para 2050 simplemente porque han dicho que lo harán”, dijo Jennifer Morgan, directora ejecutiva de Greenpeace International. “Cuando, en realidad, no han puesto en marcha la financiación ni las políticas para que eso suceda”. Uno de los temas que se debatirán esta semana es si los países deberían tener que regresar a Naciones Unidas con más frecuencia, quizás anualmente, con planes más sólidos a corto plazo para reducir las emisiones. Por el momento, no se espera que los gobiernos presenten nuevas promesas hasta 2025. “Es un poco tarde para que muchos países fortalezcan sus promesas para esta década porque ya han construido una gran cantidad de infraestructura de combustibles fósiles y se han limitado las emisiones adicionales”, dijo Jennifer Tollmann, analista de E3G, un grupo de investigación climática. Sabra Ibrahim Noordeen es el enviado climático de las Maldivas, un archipiélago de islas bajas en el Océano Índico que ha estado habitado durante miles de años, pero que podría inundarse en tres generaciones debido al aumento del nivel del mar. Dijo que países como el suyo dependían de la cumbre para garantizar el futuro. “Por favor, logremos la meta de 1,5”, dijo. Aún más polémico es el tema del dinero, que durante mucho tiempo ha sido un enorme punto de fricción en las conversaciones sobre el clima mundial. ADVERTISEMENT Hace una década, las naciones más ricas del mundo prometieron destinar 100.000 millones de dólares anuales para 2020 con el fin de ayudar a los países más pobres a hacer la transición hacia energías más limpias y protegerse contra las crecientes amenazas de olas de calor, inundaciones, sequías e incendios forestales vinculadas al calentamiento del planeta. Hasta el momento, esas promesas no se han cumplido. Según una estimación, los países ricos todavía deben decenas de miles de millones de dólares al año. Los críticos han dicho que incluso el dinero que sí se ha invertido ha sido mal gestionado. Una gran parte de la ayuda hasta la fecha se ha entregado en forma de préstamos, y los países en desarrollo suelen tener problemas para pagarlos. Además, solo una muy pequeña parte del financiamiento se ha destinado a las iniciativas para adaptarse al cambio climático. A medida que aumentan las amenazas por el clima extremo, los países vulnerables afirman que sus necesidades financieras son cada vez mayores. Sonam P. Wangdi, quien lidera un bloque de 47 naciones conocido como los países menos adelantados (PMA), señaló que su país de origen, Bután, tiene muy poca responsabilidad por el calentamiento global, ya que la nación absorbe en la actualidad más dióxido de carbono con sus vastos bosques del que emite con sus autos y casas. Sin embargo, Bután enfrenta riesgos graves por el aumento de las temperaturas, como el derretimiento de los glaciares en el Himalaya que ya está generando inundaciones repentinas y deslizamientos de tierra que han devastado las aldeas. “Somos de los que menos han contribuido a este problema, y sin embargo lo sufrimos de manera desproporcionada”, dijo Wangdi. “Debe haber un apoyo cada vez mayor para adaptarse a los impactos”. Al mismo tiempo, los países vulnerables están proponiendo un mecanismo de financiación independiente para que se les compense por los desastres a los que no pueden adaptarse, por lo general denominados “pérdidas y daños”. Pero los países más ricos se oponen a esa propuesta, pues temen que pueda conducir a futuras reclamaciones de indemnización. “Hasta el momento, el progreso es decepcionante y, en cierto modo, aterrador”, reconoció Wangdi. “Nuestras vidas dependen de las decisiones que se tomen aquí en Glasgow”. ADVERTISEMENT Durante el fin de semana, decenas de miles de manifestantes se reunieron afuera del centro de conferencias y marcharon bajo fuertes lluvias y vientos con el fin de instar a los países para que tomen medidas más contundentes en el combate del cambio climático. Otras personas que asistieron a la cumbre sostienen que no es realista esperar que una sola conferencia resuelva el calentamiento global. El acuerdo de París tenía la intención de agregar transparencia a los planes climáticos de los países y aumentar la presión sobre los líderes mundiales para que hagan más. Pero, en última instancia, la verdadera prueba consiste en que los políticos, las empresas y los activistas hagan realidad esa visión cuando regresen a sus países. “El día después de que termine Glasgow, todavía habrá mucho trabajo por hacer”, dijo Kaveh Guilanpour, vicepresidente del Centro de Soluciones Energéticas y Climáticas que ha trabajado como negociador para varios sectores en cumbres anteriores. “Un nuevo acuerdo podría sentar las bases para lo que vendrá después, pero depende de todos nosotros mantener la presión después de eso. El problema no se solucionará de una vez”. “Es posible que no podamos medir el éxito que tuvo Glasgow hasta dentro de un par de años”, agregó.

" Imagine the forests of Chilean Patagonia: wet and cold, dense with monkey puzzle trees and other hardy conifers. Now imagine it with dinosaurs walking around. And on fire. This is what Antarctica was like 75 million years ago during the Cretaceous period, an era known by researchers as a “super fire world.” A paper published last month in Polar Research by Flaviana Jorge de Lima of the Federal University of Pernambuco and other scientists in Brazil proves that these conflagrations did not spare any continent, even one that is today notorious for its dry, inhospitable climate and largely vegetation-free landscape. Although research on prehistoric wildfires — properly called “paleofires” — has been going on for decades, much of it has concentrated on the Northern Hemisphere. Antarctica was “first considered a region without high fires, but that changed,” said André Jasper of the University of Taquari Valley in Brazil. He’s an author on the paper and part of a group of researchers around the globe seeking evidence of fires that burned between 60 million and 300 million years ago. “It’s really interesting for us because now we’re showing that not only the Northern Hemisphere was burning, but the Southern Hemisphere too,” he said. “It was global.” ADVERTISEMENT Scientists can find evidence of paleofires by studying charred tree rings, by analyzing sediment in ancient lakes or by examining molecules in fossilized charcoal. For this paper, the researchers analyzed charcoal extracted from sediment on Antarctica’s James Ross Island in 2015 and 2016. This charcoal is, on its face, nothing special. “If you do a barbecue, you will have the same type of material,” Dr. Jasper said. But the team used imaging software and scanning electron microscopy to analyze these lustrous chunks, about the height of a quarter and several times as wide. They found something far more interesting than the remains of a cookout: homogenized cells and a pitted pattern that proved these fossils started their lives as ancient plants. Using the charcoal, “it is possible to understand a little bit better the scenario of the fire, 75 million years ago,” Dr. Jasper said. With increasingly sophisticated techniques, scientists can reconstruct ancient ecosystems and fire patterns with mounting precision, said Elisabeth Dietze, vice president of the International Paleofire Network, who was not affiliated with the study. She said that molecular markers in charcoal could tell scientists what kind of vegetation burned: For example, rounder, plated molecular shapes indicate woody biomass. ADVERTISEMENT In 2010, researchers on King George Island first gathered evidence that ancient wildfires didn’t spare Antarctica. But the samples from that expedition were poorly preserved and researchers could only speculate that the charcoal stemmed from a coniferous tree. Researchers made a more accurate assessment of these new charred remains: They suspect they came from an Araucariaceae, an ancient family of conifers. For paleofire researchers, the next big question about these ancient fires concerns causality. The Cretaceous period was marked by mass extinctions, fluctuating amounts of oxygen in the atmosphere and changes in the amount of vegetation covering the planet. Did fires cause these changes, or did the changes cause the fires? Understanding this super fire world helps researchers develop models for periods of rapid ecological change and increasing numbers of fires — like now. “The more we know about the past and the linkages between the ecosystem and climate, the better prepared we are for the future,” said Cathy Whitlock of Montana State University, who was not affiliated with the study. In some ways the era humans live in can’t compare to the Cretaceous: Back then, our continents, including Antarctica, were still forming. But it’s still notable that high-latitude regions were warm, forested, ice-free and prone to blazes — a direction in which we might be moving. “Of course, this was millions of years ago, but now we have a driver,” Dr. Jasper said. “We are the driver. Nowadays we have humans putting fire on everything.” Case in point: In 2018, researchers moved these charcoal samples from the National Museum of Brazil to a different laboratory. A few months later, the museum caught fire and the country lost countless relics. These ancient chunks of charcoal, used to unlock the secrets of deep time, were themselves nearly lost in flames."
" Imagina los bosques de la Patagonia chilena: húmedos y fríos, densos de araucarias y otras coníferas resistentes. Ahora imagínalo con dinosaurios caminando por ahí. Y en llamas. Así era la Antártida hace 75 millones de años, durante el período Cretácico, una época conocida por los investigadores como un “mundo de superincendios”. Un artículo publicado el mes pasado en Polar Research por Flaviana Jorge de Lima, de la Universidad Federal de Pernambuco, y otros científicos de Brasil, demuestra que ningún continente se libró de estas conflagraciones, ni siquiera el territorio que hoy es notorio por su clima seco e inhóspito y su paisaje en gran parte sin vegetación. Aunque la investigación sobre los incendios forestales prehistóricos —llamados propiamente “paleoincendios”— lleva décadas en marcha, gran parte de ella se ha concentrado en el hemisferio norte. La Antártida fue “antes considerada como una región sin grandes incendios, pero eso cambió”, dijo André Jasper, de la Universidad del Valle de Taquari, en Brasil. Es uno de los autores del trabajo y forma parte de un grupo de investigadores de todo el mundo que buscan pruebas de incendios que ardieron hace entre 60 y 300 millones de años. ADVERTISEMENT “Es realmente interesante para nosotros porque ahora estamos demostrando que no solo el hemisferio norte ardía, sino también el hemisferio sur”, dijo. “Era algo global”. Los científicos pueden encontrar pruebas de los paleoincendios con el estudio de los anillos de los árboles carbonizados, el análisis de los sedimentos de los lagos antiguos o al examinar las moléculas del carbón vegetal fosilizado. Para este trabajo, los investigadores analizaron el carbón vegetal extraído de los sedimentos de la isla James Ross de la Antártida en 2015 y 2016. Este carbón vegetal no es, en apariencia, nada especial. “Si haces un asado, tendrás el mismo tipo de material”, dijo Jasper. Pero el equipo utilizó software de imágenes y microscopía electrónica de barrido para analizar estos lustrosos pedazos, del alto de una moneda de 25 centavos estadounidenses y varias veces más anchos. Encontraron algo mucho más interesante que los restos de una comida al aire libre: células homogeneizadas y un patrón de picaduras que demostraba que estos fósiles comenzaron su vida como plantas antiguas. Al emplear el carbón vegetal, “es posible entender un poco mejor el escenario del fuego, hace 75 millones de años”, dijo Jasper. Con técnicas cada vez más sofisticadas, los científicos pueden reconstruir ecosistemas antiguos y patrones de incendios con una precisión cada vez mayor, mencionó Elisabeth Dietze, vicepresidenta de la International Paleofire Network, que no estuvo afiliada al estudio. Señaló que los marcadores moleculares del carbón vegetal podrían indicar a los científicos qué tipo de vegetación se quemó: por ejemplo, las formas moleculares más redondeadas y chapadas indican biomasa leñosa. ADVERTISEMENT En 2010, investigadores en la isla Rey Jorge reunieron por primera vez pruebas de que la Antártida no se libró de los antiguos incendios forestales. Pero las muestras de esa expedición estaban mal conservadas y los investigadores solo pudieron especular que el carbón vegetal procedía de una conífera. Los investigadores hicieron una evaluación más precisa de estos nuevos restos carbonizados: sospechan que proceden de una Araucariaceae, una antigua familia de coníferas. Para los investigadores de los paleoincendios, la siguiente gran pregunta sobre estos antiguos incendios se refiere a la relación causal. El Cretáceo estuvo marcado por extinciones masivas, fluctuaciones en la cantidad de oxígeno en la atmósfera y cambios en la cantidad de vegetación que cubría el planeta. ¿Fueron los incendios los causantes de estos cambios, o fueron los cambios los que provocaron los incendios? Entender este mundo de superincendios ayuda a los investigadores a desarrollar modelos para los periodos de rápido cambio ecológico y creciente número de incendios, como ahora. “Cuanto más sepamos sobre el pasado y los vínculos entre el ecosistema y el clima, mejor preparados estaremos para el futuro”, afirma Cathy Whitlock, de la Universidad Estatal de Montana, que no está afiliada al estudio. En cierto modo, la época en que vivimos los humanos no se puede comparar con el Cretáceo: en aquella época, nuestros continentes, incluida la Antártida, aún se estaban formando. Pero sigue siendo notable que las regiones de alta latitud eran cálidas, boscosas, sin hielo y propensas a las llamas, una dirección hacia la que podríamos estarnos dirigiendo. “Por supuesto, esto fue hace millones de años, pero ahora tenemos un conductor”, dijo Jasper. “Nosotros somos el conductor. Hoy en día tenemos a los humanos poniéndole fuego a todo”. Un ejemplo: en 2018, los investigadores trasladaron estas muestras de carbón vegetal del Museo Nacional de Brasil a otro laboratorio. Unos meses después, el museo se incendió y el país perdió innumerables reliquias. Estos antiguos trozos de carbón vegetal, usados para desvelar los secretos del tiempo profundo, estuvieron a punto de perderse en las llamas."

" GLASGOW — Defying biting wind and steady rain, tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Glasgow on Saturday in noisy and colorful protests, calling on global leaders to take action drastic enough to match the scale of a climate crisis already wreaking havoc on parts of the globe. Waving banners, beating drums and chanting, an array of demonstrators — including members of trade unions and faith organizations, as well as left-wing groups — took over large parts of the Scottish city, which is hosting the COP26 climate summit. By midafternoon, a long, winding line of protesters was making its way through the city,  and by late afternoon they were still streaming into Glasgow Green, a city park, to hear speeches from activists. The protest illustrated how the battle to curb climate change had become an umbrella for a growing protest movement that aims to put global leaders under pressure for a broad range of causes, including racial justice and income equality. “We should not underestimate the significance of how the climate movement has broken through into the mainstream in the last two years because it’s really starting to change people’s consciousness,” said Feyzi Ismail, a lecturer in global policy and activism at Goldsmiths, University of London. ADVERTISEMENT “I think it is more important than what’s going on inside the COP meeting because it’s applying the kind of pressure that’s needed to force governments to act, but also to take far more radical positions than they might have,” she added. The police did not provide an estimate for the size of the crowd. Organizers said that more than 100,000 people took part, and while that was not possible to verify independently, the gathering was sprawling and extensive; at one point the procession took more than an hour to pass a fixed location. Many of the protesters said they were motivated by  a connection to their own lives. “Flooding is happening, and it is going to keep happening,” said Alexandra Bryden, 63, an upholsterer and curtain maker from Auchterarder, north of Edinburgh, who said that her workshop had been flooded and that she worried about the future of her family members who live by the coast. According to some organizers, more than 200 events were planned around with the world, with more than half of that number in Britain. In London thousands marched from the Bank of England to Trafalgar Square, and there were protests in other British cities including Birmingham and Bristol. In Paris, hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of City Hall, where activists held up portraits of world leaders they accused of doing too little to curb global warming. The leaders’ names, including President Biden and President Emmanuel Macron of France, were read out and then booed by the crowd. . ADVERTISEMENT But the focus on Saturday was in Glasgow, where authorities  closed off several dozen streets to manage the protests. “People are coming out in this weather to say we have had enough of this,” said Robert Dickie, 64, a retired accountant from Hamilton, Scotland, near Glasgow, wearing a kilt and speaking after playing the bagpipes. “Things have got to change before we all become extinct — and that is what is going to happen in the long term,” he said. By mid afternoon, the storms had lifted, a rainbow appeared briefly, and helicopters hovered overhead. A massive crowd cheered as a number of Indigenous activists from the Americas took the stage and demanded that world leaders prioritize the protections of their ancestral lands. In Glasgow there was some confrontation with police, who said they removed protesters who blocked a bridge and were “containing” another group “following an escalation in their conduct.” The protests related to COP26, the United Nations climate summit, peaked on Friday and Saturday, drawing tens of thousands of people to Glasgow’s streets. Here’s what I saw →          ADVERTISEMENT But despite the poor weather there was an uplifting mood for the most part at Saturday’s march, which was the culmination of smaller protests that took place during the week around the city. They included a substantial youth-led demonstration on Friday organized by the group Fridays for Future, an international movement that grew out of Greta Thunberg’s solo school strike in 2018. She addressed the crowd on Friday and described COP26 as “a failure.” The first week of the climate summit saw new pledges to tackle deforestation and to move away from coal. At least 105 countries signed an agreement to reduce emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, by 30 percent this decade. Major financial institutions said they would mobilize trillions of dollars to help shift the global economy toward cleaner energy. Still, experts say that, to avert the worst effects of climate change, temperature rise needs to be limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, between preindustrial times and the end of this century. And that goal is not within reach even if all countries fulfill their current pledges. Like many environmental groups, protesters in Glasgow were skeptical of pledges, doubting that such promises would be delivered and arguing that, in any case, they did not go far enough to solve an urgent global problem. “There are going to be communities on the Scottish coast that will be cut off. It is real,” said Ms. Bryden, the upholsterer. “I can’t look my grandson in the eye. I am sorry about what he is going to have to put up with in the future.” Bel Burn, 59, a retired health worker from Cumbria, in northern England, said she was protesting because she opposed intensive agriculture and described how she had bought 20 acres of land, on which she planned to plant 4,200 trees. ADVERTISEMENT  “They haven’t gone far enough,” she said referring to global leaders. “They have agreed a lot of this stuff before, why would we believe it’s going to be different this time?” Stuart Graham, a Glasgow trade union official and a member of the COP26 Coalition that organized the protests, said he hoped the march would bolster campaigns for free public transportation and for a huge program to insulate and improve the city’s housing stock. “It’s critical that we have a civil society with a powerful voice to hold these leaders to account,” he said. Organizers argue that the bewildering range of groups with different agendas are united by a common commitment to what they call climate justice. Katia Penha, one of the activists, who is also part of the Quilombola community, a group of Black rural residents in Brazil, said her community has been affected by mining and wants its challenges to be acknowledged alongside Indigenous communities that are disproportionately affected. “We came here to tell the world: Without us — the Quilombola’s people in Brazil — it’s not possible to have debate about climate change,” she said, pointing out how a burst hydroelectric dam in 2015 in Mariana, Brazil, killed Quilombola people and wiped out communities. Elsewhere, vegan activists carried balloons of a cow and a chicken with the message, “Thank you for not eating us.” On a hillside, a group spelled out “Amazonia Forever” with strips of cloth above the image of a butterfly, calling attention to the destruction of the rainforest. ADVERTISEMENT Ms. Ismail, the Goldsmiths lecturer, said that the question for the protest movement was whether it could extend its influence by combining with trade unions and persuading workers to use the threat of strikes to push forward a coherent agenda. But she said it had made strides already. “The protest movement is the only thing that is going to change the situation,” Ms. Ismail said. “If there is no pressure, there will be no change.” Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris."
" WASHINGTON — The $1 trillion infrastructure bill now headed to President Biden’s desk includes the largest amount of money ever spent by the United States to prepare the nation to withstand the devastating impacts of climate change. The $47 billion in the bill designated for climate resilience is intended to help communities prepare for the new age of extreme fires, floods, storms and droughts that scientists say are worsened by human-caused climate change. The money is the most explicit signal yet from the federal government that the economic damages of a warming planet have already arrived. Its approval by Congress with bipartisan support reflects an implicit acknowledgment of that fact by at least some Republicans, even though many of the party’s leaders still question or deny the established science of human-caused climate change. “It’s a big deal, and we’ll build up our resilience for the next storm, drought, wildfires and hurricanes that indicate a blinking code red for America and the world,” Mr. Biden said in a speech in late October. ADVERTISEMENT But still in limbo on Capitol Hill is a second, far larger spending bill that is packed with $555 billion intended to try to mitigate climate change, by reducing the carbon dioxide pollution that is trapping heat and driving up global temperatures. House Democratic leaders on Friday came to the cusp of bringing that bill to the floor for a vote, but ultimately had to scrap the plans because they did not have enough support in their own caucus to pass it. They hope to attempt a vote before Thanksgiving. “There’s a lot of good stuff in the infrastructure bill to help us prepare for climate upheaval, but that package does very little to affect emissions, and therefore won’t prevent climate upheaval,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, one of the most prominent champions of climate action in Congress. “It’s significant that we could get a significant bipartisan measure that recognized that climate change was real and we need to protect our infrastructure against its impacts,” said Mr. Whitehouse. “But it’s not enough to just do repair work. We need to prevent the worse scenarios.” ADVERTISEMENT The spending falls far short of the levels of government action that scientific reports have concluded is needed to either prevent or prepare for the worst impacts of climate change. While the infrastructure bill would spend $47 billion to prepare the nation for worsening floods, fires and storms, in 2018, the federal government’s National Climate Assessment estimated that adapting to climate change could ultimately cost “tens to hundreds of billions of dollars per year.” Still, experts and lawmakers call the level of spending for “climate resilience” in the infrastructure bill historic, particularly after four years in which former President Donald J. Trump denied the established science of climate change, decimated environmental regulations and withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord. “This greatly exceeds anything we were able to get under the Obama administration,” said Alice Hill, who oversaw planning for climate risks on the National Security Council while Barack Obama was president. “We’ve made enormous progress.” The climate resilience spending in the infrastructure bill is remarkable for something rarely achieved in congressional debates over climate policy: bipartisan support. A handful of Republicans who voted for the infrastructure bill were heavily involved in crafting the climate resilience provisions, spurred on by a recognition that global warming is already harming their constituents. Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, who helped write the climate resilience provisions, will see new money flow to his state with passage of the bill. In September, Hurricane Ida left at least 82 people dead and millions without power in Louisiana, in the wake of a storm that scientists say offered a clear picture of the types of devastation that climate change will continue to wreak. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Cassidy called the bill “the largest investment in infrastructure and coastal resiliency in the history of Louisiana.” “There’s people living in Livingston Parish, for example, flooded in 2016, whose lives — everything in their life was destroyed,” he said. “The pictures of their children, the wedding dress in which they married, the home in which they lived, which had never flooded before — the fact that we are helping our fellow Americans avoid that gives me an incredible sense of satisfaction.” Billions of dollars in federal funds will begin flowing to other communities around the country that have been or expect to be hit by the extreme weather events that scientists say are growing more frequent and more destructive by climate change. Those climate impacts are already being felt in every corner of the United States. There were 22 climate disasters that cost at least $1 billion each in the United States in 2020, shattering the previous record of 16 events, which occurred in 2017 and 2011, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That record is on track to be broken again this year. This summer, the hottest on record in the nation, saw record wildfires devastate large swaths of California and a deadly heat wave bake the Pacific Northwest. Once-in-200-year flash floods killed dozens of people in New York and New Jersey. ADVERTISEMENT “It’s rare that you ever have the financial resources — any financial resources — for resilience,” said Al Leonard, the town planner for Fair Bluff, a small town in eastern North Carolina struggling to recover from repeated floods. “When there’s some federal money or state money that becomes available, it really is manna from heaven.” The measure will provide an injection of money for existing programs designed to help address the effects of climate change. The bill receives final approval. The House passed the $1 trillion bill on Nov. 5 to rebuild the country’s aging public works system. The proposal is a central plank of President Biden’s economic agenda, which he signed into law on Nov. 15. Here’s what’s inside the bill: Transportation. The proposal would see tens of billions of dollars in new federal spending going to roads, bridges and transportation programs. Amtrak would see its biggest infusion of money since its inception, and funds would be allocated to programs intended to provide safe commutes for pedestrians. Climate. Funding would be provided to better prepare the country to face global warming. The Forest Service would get billions of dollars to reduce the effects of wildfires. The bill includes $73 billion to modernize the nation’s electricity grid to allow it to carry renewable energy. Resources for underserved communities. A new $2 billion grant program is expected to expand transportation projects in rural areas. The bill would also increase support for Native American communities, allotting $216 million to the Bureau of Indian Affairs for climate-resilience and adaptation efforts. Internet access. The bill includes $65 billion meant to connect hard-to-reach rural communities and low-income city dwellers to high-speed internet. Other provisions seek to stoke competition and transparency among service providers. For example, the Army Corps of Engineers is to receive an additional $11.6 billion in construction funds for projects like flood control and river dredging. That’s more than four times the amount Congress gave the Corps last year for construction. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has its own program to reduce the damage from flooding, by buying or elevating homes at risk from floods. That program will see its annual budget more than triple, to $700 million, along with new funding for similar programs. One community in particular that might be eligible for such flood prevention funding: Three Forks, Montana, which sits at the confluence of the Jefferson, Gallatin and Madison Rivers, and is at significant risk of flooding, according to new FEMA floodplain maps. Earlier this year, the city’s staff and mayor designed a plan to prevent such flooding, by directing floodwaters into a dry river channel. The town applied for federal funds but failed to receive them, said Patricia Hernandez, the director of Headwaters Economics, a nonpartisan Montana-based research organization that studies the financial impacts of climate change. “Now, with this bill, they are likely to get that money,” Ms. Hernandez said. “And their flood risk reduction project will also help the region’s housing affordability and economy.” ADVERTISEMENT The Bureau of Reclamation, which manages water supplies in the West, now gets $20 million a year from Congress for desalination projects, which remove minerals and salts from seawater to create fresh water, and another $65 million for water recycling. With passage of the legislation those numbers will skyrocket: The bill includes $250 million for desalination over five years, and $1 billion for water recycling and reuse, the process of treating waste water to make it available for new uses such as irrigation. Other funding is slated toward new approaches. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will receive $492 million to map and forecast inland and coastal flooding, including “next-generation water modeling activities.” NOAA would also get $50 million to predict, model and forecast wildfires. The Department of Agriculture is on track to receive $500 million for what it calls “wildfire defense grants to at-risk communities” — money that could help people make changes to their homes or landscape, for example, to make them less vulnerable to fires. The bill also provides $216 million to the Bureau of Indian Affairs for climate resilience and adaptation for tribal nations, which have been disproportionately hurt by climate change. More than half of that money, $130 million, is to go toward “community relocation” — moving groups of Indigenous Americans away from vulnerable areas. Also under the plan, the Department of Transportation will send states money to move highways out of flood-prone areas and the Environmental Protection Agency will pay for communities to relocate drinking water infrastructure at risk from flooding or other extreme weather. Climate experts caution that all that spending should just be seen as a down payment; absent billions of dollars of additional money and aggressive action to sharply reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the costs of adapting to the new realities of global warming will only climb in the coming years. “Fifty billion dollars for resilience is both transformational and totally inadequate,” said Shalini Vajjhala, executive director of the San Diego Regional Policy & Innovation Center, a nonprofit associated with the Brookings Institution. ADVERTISEMENT “If you compare the total to some of the largest resilient infrastructure projects being planned in the U.S., it’s tiny,” Ms. Vajjhala said. “This is progress, not perfection.” Emily Cochrane contributed reporting."
" Protest organizers hoped to draw large crowds to the streets of Glasgow on Saturday to demand urgent action against a climate crisis that is already flooding cities, wiping towns off the map, destroying forests, and fueling storms, heat waves and droughts around the world. Over the past week, world leaders and diplomats from hundreds of countries have gathered at the U.N. climate conference, making lofty pronouncements and announcing progress, including landmark agreements to end deforestation and reduce methane emissions. But the commitments would, at best, slow the rate of global warming, not halt it. For activists across the globe, including many young people alarmed about inheriting a planet on the brink of disaster, the talks amount to what Greta Thunberg, the 18-year-old Swedish climate activist, on Friday called a “two-week-long celebration of business as usual and ‘blah, blah, blah.’”    Capturing the global mood of impatience and frustration among her allies, Ms. Thunberg, who has helped galvanize a generation to action, castigated world leaders for empty promises. Speaking to thousands of protesters at a youth-led rally in Glasgow on Friday, she called the United Nations talks a “failure.” ADVERTISEMENT “The leaders are not doing nothing,” she said. “They are actively creating loopholes, shaping frameworks to benefit themselves to continue profiting from this destructive system.” Her words were greeted with cheers. Moments before she spoke, Vanessa Nakate, an activist from Uganda, bemoaned the inaction that had followed previous international climate talks. “How many more of these should they hold until they realize that their inactions are destroying the planet?” she asked. But Michael E. Mann, a prominent climate scientist, took to Twitter to defend the summit, however short it might fall of what is needed. “Activists declaring it dead on arrival makes fossil fuel executives jump for joy,” he wrote. ADVERTISEMENT The conference has underlined the socio-economic disparities shaping global climate policy, in some cases pitting advanced industrialized countries like the United States and European Union nations against emerging economies, including China, India and South Africa. On Friday, activists from South America, Central America, Africa and Asia berated their leaders for failed climate policies and criticized international leaders for ignoring the developing world. As many as 100,000 people were expected to take the streets of Glasgow on Saturday. Climate activists from across the world have arrived in the city this week, demanding change, disrupting talks held by gas giants and staging theatrical spectacles on the fringes of the summit. But the presence of environmental activists inside the meeting itself has been muted, in part because of pandemic restrictions, and some were unable to attend the event at all. Despite the rain, thousands out in Glasgow marching to demand action on climate change on the sidelines of #Cop26. Follow our live coverage here: https://t.co/oyDPremCP6 pic.twitter.com/L4T6S3NV1x Within the conference, countries are debating how to deliver on the unmet promises of years past, including a pledge of $100 billion in annual aid from 2020 to 2025 from wealthy countries to help poorer ones adapt to a warming planet. Countries that are most at risk from the effects of climate change in the developing world are also pushing major carbon-emitting nations to increase their annual targets to keep global temperatures from rising past 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, compared with levels before the Industrial Revolution."
" GLASGOW — The week began with more than 130 presidents and prime ministers posing for a group photo in a century-old Baroque museum crafted from red sandstone. Fewer than 10 were women. Their median age, as their host at the climate summit, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, reminded them, was over 60. The week ended with boisterous protests of thousands on the streets of Glasgow. A march on Friday was led by young climate activists, some barely old enough to vote in their countries. They accused the world leaders of wasting what little time remains to safeguard their future. These bookends to the first week of this watershed international climate summit in Scotland reveal a widening divide that threatens to grow larger in the weeks and months ahead. Those with the power to make decisions about how much the world warms in the coming decades are mostly old and male. Those who are angriest about the pace of climate action are mostly young and female. ADVERTISEMENT The two sides have vastly divergent views of what the summit should achieve. Indeed, they seem to have different notions of time. At the summit, leaders are setting goals for 2030 at the earliest. In some cases, they’re setting targets for 2060 and 2070, when many of today’s activists will be hitting retirement age. The activists say change must come immediately. They want countries to abruptly stop using fossil fuels and to repair the climate damage that is now being felt in all corners of the globe but is especially punishing the most vulnerable people in the Global South. For them, mid-century is an eternity. “Now is the time. Yesterday was the time,” is how Dominique Palmer, 22, an activist with Fridays for Future International, put it during a panel discussion at The New York Times Climate Hub on Thursday. “We need action right now.” Social movements have almost always been led by young people. But what makes the climate movement’s generational divide so pointed — and the fury of the young so potent — is that world leaders have been meeting and talking about the need to address climate change since before most of the protesters were born, with few results. In fact, emissions of planet-warming gases have risen sharply since the first international climate summit 27 years ago. Now scientists say the world has less than a decade to sharply cut emissions to avert the worst climate consequences. That urgency drives the protesters. ADVERTISEMENT Or as one banner at Friday’s demonstration articulated, “Don’t Mess With My Future.” World leaders are showing a sensitivity to that criticism. Their public and private remarks in Glasgow have been laced with both paeans to the passion of the young as well as a hint of anxiety. They’ll have to face young voters back home; many of these leaders have done so already, with climate action emerging as an important election issue, at least in some countries, including in the United States. In Germany, voters elected their youngest Parliament, with the Green Party recording its best result ever and launching climate change to the top of its agenda. Mr. Johnson, for his part, warned his peers about their legacy. Future generations, he said in his opening remarks, “will judge us with bitterness and with a resentment that eclipses any of the climate activists of today.” The organizers of the conference took pains to include youth speakers in the official program. One after another, heads of state and government rose to the podium this week and assured attendees that they had heard the demands of the young. This did not impress Mitzi Jonelle Tan, a 24-year-old climate activist who had come to Glasgow from the Philippines. “When I hear leaders say they want to listen to our generation I think they’re lying to themselves,” Ms. Tan said in an interview on the eve of the Friday protests. ADVERTISEMENT If they are really listening, she went on, “they would be prioritizing people over profit.” “Cognitive dissonance,” was the verdict of Eric Njuguna, 19, who had come from Kenya. “We were expecting serious commitments at COP26 on climate finance and climate mitigation. The commitments aren’t strong enough.” There is a huge gap between how the leaders and the young activists view the summit. John Kerry, the 77-year-old U.S. climate envoy, marveled on Friday at the progress made at this summit. “I’ve been to a great many COPs and I will tell you there is a greater sense of urgency at this COP,” Mr. Kerry told reporters. He acknowledged the complexity of global negotiations. Diplomats are still hammering out the rules of global carbon trading and discussing how to address demands for reparations from countries that have played no role in creating the climate problem but that have suffered its most acute effects. Still, Mr. Kerry said, “I have never in the first few days counted as many initiatives and as much real money, real money put on the table, even if there are some question marks.” Jochen Flasbarth, the German energy minister, cited three areas of progress: a global agreement on reversing deforestation by 2030; a commitment to reduce methane emissions, also by 2030; and a coal exit plan endorsed by three dozen countries, though not its biggest users. ADVERTISEMENT “I understand young people are trying to push very hard to see concrete implementation and not abstract goals,” Mr. Flasbarth, 59, said Friday. “However we need these goals.” But it was when leaders spoke to each other away from the cameras that it was clear that the anger from the youth was getting under their skin. At one closed-door meeting with his fellow ministers, Mr. Flasbarth was heard expressing concern that the activists were painting all the world leaders with the same broad brush, portraying them as protectors of the fossil fuel industry. “Let’s tell young people there are differences, not all the politicians, all the countries are on the same side,” he said. “Progress is possible, and this is the group of progress.” At the same meeting, which was attended by a bloc of countries called the High Ambition Coalition, the French minister for ecological transition, Barbara Pompili, said she recognized herself in the young people. She too was once an activist, she told her fellow ministers. But then, she went on, she chose a different route. She chose to work inside the system. “I chose to be a politician,” she said. “I chose to try to act.” The differences between the decision makers inside the summit and the protesters outside the barricades extend beyond age to gender. While the world leaders and heads of state are mostly male, the streets of Glasgow have been filled with young women. ADVERTISEMENT Girls and young women around the world have emerged as some of the most passionate climate activists, arguing that many of those most vulnerable to drought, water scarcity and other climate disasters are low-income women with children to feed. As a result, the climate movement has a shared mission with efforts to educate girls in developing nations. The young women activists have found a sisterhood and a sense of empowerment in the climate protests, marches and campaigns. The inspiration for many of these young women is the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, whose school strikes for climate that began as a solo effort in 2018 have blossomed into a worldwide movement. Ms. Thunberg, 18, has become so influential that on Wednesday when she criticized carbon offsets — making up for carbon emissions in one area by paying for the reduction of emissions somewhere else — a company that verifies carbon offsets felt compelled to defend the practice. On Friday, Ms. Thunberg appeared before a cheering throng of thousands in Glasgow to pronounce the summit a failure. “The COP has turned into a P.R. event, where leaders are giving beautiful speeches and announcing fancy commitments and targets, while behind the curtains governments of the Global North countries are still refusing to take any drastic climate action,” she said. That prompted Michael Mann, the 55-year-old climate scientist, to caution that negotiations among hundreds of countries are complex, and that the politics around climate policy are not as simple as they might seem. “Activists declaring it dead on arrival makes fossil fuel executives jump for joy,” he tweeted, referring to the summit. “They want to undermine and discredit the very notion of multilateral climate action.” ADVERTISEMENT On Saturday, the young protesters returned to the streets, joining with a coalition of other groups in what organizers billed as a global day of climate action. Vanessa Nakate, a 24-year-old activist from Uganda, said the protesters were committed to keep up the pressure, “to continue holding leaders accountable for their actions.” Daphne Frias, a 23-year-old climate activist from New York City, gave a nod to the inevitable: generational change is coming. “We always say our leaders have failed us,” she said. “We are the new leaders. We are the ones who are going to make the decisions going forward.”"

" Hello from Glasgow. We’re dedicating this newsletter to COP26, the United Nations conference happening here this week and next, which we covered on the show on Wednesday. This COP is (forgive us) a tale of two conferences. There are the official meetings, which are attended by 130 heads of state and government and their delegations, intending to set new targets for cutting emissions from burning coal, oil and gas that are heating the planet. Then there is everything happening outside the conference — where tens of thousands of activists have gathered to demand more from world leaders, call for collective action and highlight the Indigenous and marginalized voices often left out of the climate conversation. “We’ve been building to this moment with our climate coverage all year,” Clare Toeniskoetter, a senior producer on The Daily, said. “We tried to go inside the conference to ask the question many people outside it have posed, which is: Will this conference make a difference?” ADVERTISEMENT In this newsletter, we wanted to take you outside the conference to give an update on what has happened since Wednesday. Then we share a playlist of our climate episodes that explore the real-world effects of the diplomats’ decisions. The Daily strives to reveal a new idea in every episode. Below, we go deeper on one of those from our show this week. Sarah Adam was a Green Peace member and vegetarian long before Food Inc., Michael Pollan and Ariana Grande made eating only vegetables cool. ADVERTISEMENT Over the past few decades, Sarah, 50, a nurse from Birmingham, England, has grown up alongside the climate justice movement. “I’ve been fighting for this since I was about 15,” she said at a protest outside the U.N.’s global climate summit, COP26. “And for 30 years, it felt on the periphery. Now it’s all front and center.” An estimated 25,000 people marched across Glasgow today in the largest protest in the city since the conference started. The protest was led by the international climate movement Fridays for Future, drawing a crowd of youth, Indigenous activists and veteran environmentalists like Sarah, who attended with her 19-year-old daughter. Seeing the crowd made Sarah “really hopeful,” even as activists speaking onstage at the protest demanded more from world leaders. Greta Thunberg, whose 2018 climate strike inspired Fridays for Future, described the climate talks in Glasgow as “a failure,” adding, “We cannot solve a crisis by the same methods that got us into it in the first place.” This week, governments and corporations have made pledges to reduce emissions, move away from coal, eliminate deforestation and deliver money to help poor countries adapt. Activists at the protest today dismissed the commitments as part of a “two-week-long celebration of business as usual and blah, blah, blah,” Greta said. Vanessa Nakate, a 24-year-old Ugandan activist, told the protesters, “We need to continue holding leaders accountable for their actions.” “The kids have every reason to be frustrated,” John Kerry, President Biden’s special envoy on climate change, said at the New York Times Climate Hub after the protest. “We will get to a low-carbon economy — we will get there. The only issue is, will we get there in time?” Having watched COPs for decades, Sarah said she had to hope change would come out of this “much better attended and much better publicized” conference. Although in previous COPs, countries “might have sent junior members of staff and delegates,” she said she was grateful that Biden, Boris Johnson and European heads of state had attended. “That wouldn’t have happened 10 years ago.” Clare Toeniskoetter, our producer, explains the significance of their attendance. “This is the one moment where the Davids and Goliaths are together, face to face, at the same table,” Clare said. “I think we represented that in the episode, hearing from Biden and Boris, but also the leaders of Fiji and Barbados.” ADVERTISEMENT And young people traveled from six continents to join the protests outside to urge all national representatives, from the G20 and outside of it, to act. When asked what message they had for world leaders, Gaia Rey, 9, from Glasgow, said: “This is my future. Don’t mess with it.” Daniela Mengual, also 9, from Spain, said, “We need to act fast.” And finally, Jacob Hine, 13, from the Lake District in England, had a message for the prime minister of Britain: “Get your ears cleaned out and listen.” For the past few months, The Daily has produced a series of climate-related episodes. We have told personal stories of individuals and families learning to live with extreme weather events and followed the bumpy road toward passing policy that may help to curb the worst effects of our warming planet. “After hearing the stories of families and individuals on the ground who are struggling to adapt to the effects of climate change, COP was the moment to ask questions about whether conferences and commitments can spur the action needed to slow the planet’s warming,” Claudine Ebeid McElwain, a senior editor said. ADVERTISEMENT As we wrap up the first week of COP26, we thought we’d give you a short playlist of some of our recent episodes that focus on the real-world effects of the discussions at the conference. How a Single Senator Derailed Biden’s Climate Plan: The Clean Electricity Program was the heart of the Biden climate agenda — it would have reduced the role fossil fuels played in the production of electricity. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, however, withdrew his support. Where does that leave American climate policy? One Family’s Fight Against the Dixie Fire: The Times reporter Annie Correal tells us a story close to her heart. In this episode, she followed her family in India Valley, in Northern California, as her aunt, uncle and cousins stood their ground and protected their property as the Dixie wildfire closed in. A ‘Code Red for Humanity’: In August, a stark warning was delivered in a U.N. scientific report: The climate crisis has arrived, and it’s going to get worse before it gets better. Which Towns Are Worth Saving: We visited some regularly flood-hit towns in North Carolina — Avon and Fair Bluff — to confront a heartbreaking question: How does a community decide whether its homes are worth saving? The Aftermath of Hurricane Ida: When Hurricane Ida hit New Orleans this year, comparisons with Katrina were made. There was, however, a crucial difference: In the years since Katrina, the city has invested heavily in flood defenses. Yet, on the ground there was little cause for celebration. A Wind Farm in Coal Country: How and why one local politician in Carbon County, Wyo. — a conservative who says he’s “not a true believer” in climate change — brought wind power to his community. ADVERTISEMENT Monday: Inside the Times investigation that found that U.S. police officers have killed more than 400 unarmed drivers or passengers during traffic stops in the past five years. Tuesday: A look at rising inflation in the U.S. and the tense political situation it has created for President Biden. Wednesday: Hundreds of heads of state have gathered in Glasgow for COP26. Will it spur action? Thursday: Why did the Democrats perform poorly in this week’s closely watched elections? Friday: The trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager who shot and killed two people in Kenosha, Wis., last summer. Have thoughts about the show? Tell us what you think at thedaily@nytimes.com.

" LONDON — A once-unremarkable patch of ocean floor in deep waters northwest of Scotland’s Shetland Islands has become a crucial test case for the British government, environmental groups and the oil industry. An energy company says there is valuable oil and gas to be extracted from the site, but it needs the government’s approval. Environmental activists want to stop the project and have seized on Britain’s role as host of a major United Nations climate conference in Glasgow this month as an opportunity to confront the government over its continued support for the oil and gas industry. The government, so far, is keeping quiet. Offshore oil drilling projects like this used to be approved routinely in Britain. Over the last half-century, oil platforms became a regular site in the North Sea, generating revenue, jobs and some energy independence for Britain. This project, called Cambo, came into the spotlight in June when a company called Siccar Point Energy submitted a request for approval to the government. One of the company’s main backers is Blackstone, the Wall Street fund management giant. Siccar Point owns 70 percent of Cambo, and Royal Dutch Shell the rest. ADVERTISEMENT Environmental organizations like Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth say it would be inconsistent for Britain to claim leadership on climate issues while still approving new oil fields. They have waged a campaign that has included demonstrations like sending kayakers near a ship in Norway that they thought was trying to start work on the project. Senior government officials, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson, have not tipped their hand but have tried to portray the approval process as a regulatory matter moving through the Oil and Gas Authority. Ultimately, though, it is likely to be a political decision. In a few months, Cambo has become a bellwether for the oil industry and climate activists. Both groups say rejecting it would signal death for the oil industry in Britain, and, perhaps, other countries. “Rejection of Cambo would actually say we are not serious about energy policy in the U.K.,” said Mike Tholen, director for sustainability at Oil and Gas UK, an industry group. For Caroline Rance, a campaigner for Friends of the Earth Scotland, “Cambo is a very egregious example of the U.K.’s climate hypocrisy,” she said, speaking in a telephone interview from near the COP26 conference. “This is the reason that Cambo has become such a big, iconic fight.” ADVERTISEMENT Here is more about this project, and the implications of the decision on whether it should be approved. Cambo is an oil field, discovered in 2002, in a region of the North Sea that has produced some of the largest finds in British waters in recent years. The field holds an estimated 800 million barrels, and Siccar Point says it would deliver 170 million barrels of oil and natural gas over a 25-year lifetime, making it a relatively large field for Britain. Cambo (the name apparently refers to a village in Northumberland, Siccar Point said) has probably not been developed to date because of the region’s rough weather and the cost of drilling in deep water; it’s more than 3,000 feet deep in that area. Siccar Point says it would invest about $2.6 billion into the project over the next five years if it were approved, creating 1,000 jobs in Britain. The company says it has spent about $190 million on it already since it acquired the rights to the field in 2017. Environmental campaigners are skeptical, saying that much of the construction work for the oil field is likely to be performed in other countries. Yes. Siccar Point says the project would send the equivalent of 134,000 tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere per year, equal to less than 1 percent of all the emissions caused by producing oil and gas in Britain, the company said. ADVERTISEMENT But those figures do not include the much larger volume of emissions produced when the oil and gas is burned, a point stressed by organizations like Greenpeace UK. The argument in favor of developments like Cambo is that Britain still needs oil and gas, and so it makes more sense to produce these fuels from the North Sea, creating jobs and supporting the local economy, than to import them. Also, Britain has embarked on a program to reduce the substantial emissions that oil and gas operations produce; imported oil and gas wouldn’t fall under those regulations. On the other hand, environmentalists say that they could be on the verge of a major victory in the fight to halt the warming of the atmosphere — if not on Cambo, then in the future. “We want to change the law so there can be no new applications coming forward,” Ms. Rance said, “and move towards a phase-out of oil and gas.”"

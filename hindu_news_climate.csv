" With COP26 a wrap, young influencers across the world sharing their views through social media and reports galore, climate change and its impact has never been more top of mind for so many people. And increasingly what we’ve seen, and really excitingly, is youth awareness and participation from every corner of the world. In India, traditional knowledge, including that on nature, has been passed on within communities for generations. Today we see a clear and strong correlation between education and climate change awareness! Young people and students are the future of our nations and communities, and all their education shapes their views and sense of accountability for climate action and responsible living. On the formal education front, India has had an active policy for environment education since the 2003  Supreme Court directive set out a possible way forward; with the goal being to educate each young Indian about the environment, learn about sustainability and the real risks emerging from climate change. There is an active argument in favour of including climate change education (CCE) in schools as it acts as a positive impetus for India’s efforts to meet its sustainable development goal targets (SDGs), a key priority at the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference held earlier this November. In India, we are seeing a rise in youth climate organisations demanding greater climate action, climate change education and climate justice. Community-based youth movements are establishing strong links with school clubs to spur grassroots mobilisation, including learning about climate change and sustainability. The British Council — with a long history of addressing climate change through the arts, education and English — builds on this very idea through its Climate Connection programme. Climate Connection enables youth, policymakers, artists, teachers, students as well as business and community leaders across its global network opportunities to find creative and collaborative solutions to common climate change challenges. Recently, the British Council ran a global survey for its Global Youth Letter -crowdsourced across 23 countries. The survey found 78% of young Indians (between 18 and 25) did feel equipped to act against issues arising from climate change like the loss of forest cover, rises in temperature, uneven rainfall pattern and loss of biodiversity. It attracted the views of thousands of young people around the world with an active opinion on climate change and, once again, placed the spotlight on young people being at the centre of global collaborative approaches. The intent of the survey and the Global Youth Letter was to create a platform for young voices across the world, so their points of view were presented to policymakers at COP26. The survey offers a ray of hope for the future. It underlines the intent of young people from both urban and non-urban backgrounds – in India and across the world – to look for solutions to the climate crisis. It also highlights the potential of social media – a tool this generation is well-versed in - as an enabler of awareness and motivation among citizens globally; to be conscious of climate change 24x7. Youth – the future agents of change – do need the right support, and greater access to training and skills development for their intent to result in successful action. On the education and skilling front, innovative experiences can be planned as part of extra-curricula activities to be balanced with the formal school curriculum. It would be useful if educators and curricula designers could find ways to better integrate CCE with the social sciences. As with all subjects, classroom study is more effective when we are clear on the critical role teachers play, and empower them with the right teaching tools and materials. Our experience has shown that when teachers have access to the right teaching tools for the right student demographic, students do understand the challenge climate change poses and can even navigate the dangers of eco anxiety much better. By using tools such as podcasts, videos and even free university-level MOOCs created by global universities such as the University of Edinburgh , educators and teachers can integrate climate change themes into existing curricula and deliver customised lesson plans with far greater success. In India, there is scope to evaluate the approach to CCE in schools - not just in the metros - but also in the vast network of schools beyond tier 1 and 2 cities. Greater understanding and awareness is generated if, for topics related to sustainability and the environment, students are engaged through real life experiential projects where they can learn through action and project based decision making. This approach makes these important topics more real, students are more engaged and keeps children and students in the classrooms. A hybrid model where the arts, drama, documentaries and workshops on climate change could become part of the formal curriculum alongside the formal classroom subjects. The key then must be to explore innovative and collaborative teaching methods that create the right kind of impulses and empathy, and a sense of curiosity, excitement and critical thinking in children in what could then truly become a transformative journey of awakening to the real dangers of climate change and the role that as the country’s future they can play in averting a climate crisis. One way could be to take an approach that makes climate change education, like science for instance, a far more exciting and collaborative experience for young people. The popular documentary, “David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet 3 ”, is a fine example of educating young audiences through moving storytelling in digital mediums such as audiobooks and Netflix. In this very exciting and engaging documentary, the legendary English broadcaster, natural historian and author Sir David Attenborough, who was also the UK’s People’s Advocate at COP26, draws from 60 years of tracking the planet’s biodiversity to underline the importance of the choices we make today, and offering hope when he says: “Life cycles on, and if we make the right choices, ruin can become regrowth.”"
" Despite recent headline-grabbing promises to protect its rainforest before the end of the decade, Brazil has once again seen a jump in deforestation. The latest figures released by Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE), which tracks the state of the Amazon rainforest, showed a 22% increase from last year. Some 13,235 square kilometers (5,110 square miles) disappearing between August 1, 2020, and July 31, 2021. The new statistics were dated October 27 — before the start of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow — prompting environmental organizations like Greenpeace to accuse the Brazilian government of trying to clean up its image during the crucial talks. ""There is no amount of greenwashing that can hide what [President Jair] Bolsonaro is doing to destroy the Amazon. If anyone believed Bolsonaro's government's empty promises at COP, the truth is in these numbers. Unlike Bolsonaro, the satellites don't lie,"" the group said in a press statement. A pledge to save the rainforest? Brazil, along with more than 100 other global leaders, pledged during the UN climate conference in Glasgow to stop and reverse deforestation by 2030. Its Amazon rainforest represents about a third of all the tropical forests left on Earth. This huge, biologically rich region is key to helping absorb planet-warming CO2; forests absorb roughly 30% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, according to the World Resources Institute. But, despite a significant drop in deforestation from a high of 27,700 square kilometers (10,700 square miles) in 2004 to just over 4,500 square kilometers in 2012, illegal logging, agricultural expansion, and damaging wildfires have slowly pushed that rate back up over the last decade — especially since President Jair Bolsonaro took office in January 2019. ""The environmental track record of Brazil's federal government is appalling, and multiple lines of evidence show that they have been simultaneously encouraging deforestation whilst reducing investment in environmental enforcement,"" said Jos Barlow, a British conservation science professor based at Lancaster University, who has worked in Brazil since 1998. ""Without a dramatic change in their approach, the commitments made at COP should be seen in this context — at least until the election in a year's time,"" he told DW. Amazon has ‘already changed beyond all recognition’ The Brazilian rainforest plays a key role in mitigating climate change, but Bolsonaro is primarily concerned with its economic possibilities. Under his government, environmental authorities have been defunded and land protections loosened. This has encouraged loggers, farmers, and cattle ranchers to further develop the Amazon region, some 60 per cent of which — about the size of western Europe — is found in Brazil. ""The Amazon is in the center of the global debate on climate change,"" said Andre Guimaraes, executive director of a Brazilian think tank, Amazon Environmental Research Institute, in an email to DW. ""It stocks carbon, and it is a source of rain to agriculture and energy. But nothing seems to echo [with] the federal administration, that has chosen wrong, expensive and inefficient ways to deal with deforestation."" Some observers believe parts of the world's largest remaining rainforest may be nearing a tipping point, beyond which its ecosystem could collapse and substantially weaken any efforts to limit global heating. Barlow, a co-founder of the Sustainable Amazon Network research group, has noticed significant changes in the Santarem region, in the eastern part of the Amazon. Since the 1980s, he said the region has seen a 34 per cent decrease in rainfall during the dry season, a temperature rise of more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), and an increase in huge wildfires that have wiped out more than 1 million hectares of forest. “The forests and the landscapes have already changed beyond all recognition in the past 20 years, and the rate of change is speeding up. So yes, it is very close to a tipping point. But I like to hope we can still avert it, even in these regions,” he told DW. EU takes steps to limit deforestation Barlow was encouraged by the actions of state-level governments in the Amazon region, some of which have made their own commitments to stop deforestation. “There is also increasing international pressure, with Europe and the UK committing to deforestation-free commodity imports,” he said. On Wednesday, the European Commission presented a proposal to restrict imports on goods linked to deforestation, among them soybeans, palm oil, beef, wood, and products made from them. Brazil, which produces many of these products, would be hit particularly hard. ""These initiatives show that the European Union is serious about the green transition,"" said Frans Timmermans, the European Commission vice president in charge of the EU's Green Deal, adding that this would help ""promote sustainable consumption."" “This is an important step in the right direction, and it provides a powerful incentive for business to adapt and regulate itself,” said Barlow. But, he added, it wasn't enough: implementation would be a “huge challenge”, as would compliance. And, he pointed out, much of Brazil's beef is exported to places outside of the EU, like Egypt and, more generally, the Middle East. “We need all countries to agree to this.” The measure, which could still undergo changes before coming into force, will still need approval from EU member states and the European Parliament. Barlow also said measures to limit forest degradation and support the livelihoods of local Amazonians were crucial, a stance echoed by Giulia Bondi, an EU forest campaigner with transparency group Global Witness."
 Leaders at the Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow intended the summit to be a turning point in the campaign to battle the climate crisis. But they ended up saying nothing about the fundamental cause of the phenomenon — the way we live our lives. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi tried to steer the conference in that direction.          
" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi's climate ambition and initiatives at just-concluded UN climate conference COP26. ""India came up with some really impressive stuff on decarbonizing their power sector, decarbonizing their economy by 2030. The actual commitments, the solid commitments that India made are real,"" Johnson said at COP26, adding, “Narendra Modi is actually producing on his One Sun One Grid One World.” Around 200 participating countries adopted the Glasgow Climate Pact at the end of the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

" The Glasgow Climate Pact is a message to investors and executives that the march to net zero is accelerating. The agreement, negotiated by almost 200 nations over two weeks, isn’t the pact that some were hoping for. But it sets out a vision for a world that radically cuts back coal usage, eliminates fossil-fuel subsidies and commits governments to the most ambitious targets of the Paris Agreement. Skeptics argue that the whole accord rests on a massive bet that the world's biggest polluters will eliminate all their net emissions in the next few decades and say the recent surge in coal mining in China, India and Australia proves just how hard this is going to be. But the outcome of COP26 “made it crystal clear to businesses that they need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Nick Molho, executive director of Aldersgate Group, which represents companies worth 550 billion pounds ($740 billion) pushing for sustainability. Businesses will travel in that direction whether or not governments back up their pledges with policies, he said. How quickly global business and finance move away from fossil fuels is still an open question. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Sunday that the Glasgow pact sounded the “death knell” for coal, but the final language was watered down at the last minute to “phase down” unabated coal power after objections from India that were backed by the US and China. The qualifications leave the door open for investment in some coal plants, especially if they’re equipped with technology to capture emissions. Even so, companies are already preparing for a greener world. Hundreds of global businesses have set targets to cut carbon dioxide emissions, including oil giants like Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc. Companies were eager to show their support in Glasgow, with countless industry booths and appearances by corporate elites like Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates and BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink. In the six years since the Paris Agreement was signed, the business world has moved faster than public policy, according to John Kerry, US special presidential envoy for climate. “Not only are companies ahead of government, but companies understand that their future is tied to having a stable marketplace,” he said.  Boardrooms still have a long way to go. Only 5% of the companies listed on major European stock indexes which have set targets to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 are on track to meet their goals, according to a study by Accenture. And they’re the ones ahead of the curve. Green entrepreneurs in poorer countries face much higher funding costs than their counterparts in richer nations. Many companies in China and India — two of the world's biggest polluters — have yet to lay out detailed carbon-neutrality plans. Many of these tensions can be seen in former Bank of England governor Mark Carney's drive to get the finance industry to cut their portfolio emissions to zero by mid-century. One of the biggest announcements at COP26 came in the first week when the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero said that signatories overseeing about $130 trillion would set clear targets and timelines for greening their investments. (Michael R. Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg LP, is co-chair of GFANZ.)  The initiative was greeted with skepticism by some experts. Members didn’t say how much money will actually be shifted into green activities and they haven’t agreed on a fixed definition of net zero. JPMorgan Chase & Co., the world’s biggest funder of fossil fuels, was a late entry and hasn’t specified how it will meet GFANZ's target. The group also excludes three of the world’s biggest banks, all of which are Chinese and major providers of coal finance.  But the strength of international agreements like the Glasgow Climate Pact comes from the fact that governments are united over a single consensus, no matter how broad, that sets the foundation for investment and policy to follow. Since countries agreed in Paris to try and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels, almost every single industry in the world has been transformed. More than $2 trillion poured into green energy and technologies, according to BloombergNEF,  giving birth to a new generation of billionaires. Tesla Inc., now worth $1 trillion after sparking an entirely new ecosystem in the car industry, may be a model for future game-changers in everything from green steel to fake meat.  “For the first 20 years of the climate problem, it was governments subsidizing green technologies and making markets with regulation,” said Nick Mabey, chief executive of environmental think tank E3G. “Then technology got in front of those regulations and now governments follow the technology and the markets.” The challenge for governments and activists is holding companies accountable. In Glasgow, governments approved rules to boost scrutiny of national climate pledges. There’s a parallel effort by the Science Based Targets initiative to do the same for companies, which might prove to be even more important.   There is a “need to be realistic about what is truly possible, and for investor claims of ‘green’ approaches to be verifiable,” Jessica Alsford, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note to clients. One significant development for companies that want to reach their climate targets was an agreement on the rules to create a global market for carbon credits. The past few years has seen an explosion in interest from businesses looking to reduce emissions from their carbon balance sheets by purchasing offsets. Even as experts debate the merits of the new framework, which some warn is not watertight against greenwashing, the agreement will have “profound implications on both the supply and demand landscape of the voluntary carbon markets,” said Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at Brussels-based think tank Bruegel. “Uncertainty on this front indeed disincentivized governments to develop robust domestic markets.”  While COP26's main action happened in the Blue Zone where country negotiators worked on the pact, the Green Zone across the river Clyde saw unprecedented representation from business, finance and nonprofits.  “Glasgow will be remembered as the turning point when companies from all sectors, en masse, are now turning their attention to developing and driving their decarbonization strategies,” said Keith Tuffley, global co-head of sustainability and corporate transitions at Citigroup Inc. “It is another big step forward on the pathway towards a net-zero emissions world.”"
" The United Nations climate conference in Glasgow started on October 31 with the heads of over 140 countries scaling up expectations with impressive announcements. But, a fortnight later, 197 countries agreed to a political outcome dubbed the “Glasgow Climate Pact” which would, according to experts, continue to take the world down the over 2 degrees Celsius trajectory and clearly highlights the faultlines in the combative political will to tackle climate change.

" Leaders from nearly 200 countries accepted a new climate agreement after the COP26 summit in Glasgow concluded its plenary following a tense overtime, hammering out a deal that recognised India’s intervention for the world to “phase down” rather than “phase out” fossil fuels. The UN climate talks, which ended late on Saturday, for the first time targeted fossil fuels as the key driver of global warming, even as coal-reliant countries including India and China posed last-minute objections. On Sunday, India called the COP26 summit a “success”, saying it put across the concerns and ideas of the developing world quite “succinctly and unequivocally” in front of the world community. Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav, head of the Indian delegation at the Glasgow conference, said that the world needs to awaken to the reality that the current climate crisis has been precipitated by unsustainable lifestyles and wasteful consumption patterns in the developed countries. “The summit proved to be a success from India’s standpoint because we articulated and put across the concerns and ideas of the developing world quite succinctly and unequivocally. India presented the way for a constructive debate and equitable and just solutions at the forum.” The agreement has won applause for keeping alive the hope of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius, but many of the delegations said they wished they had come away with more. “If it’s a good negotiation, all the parties are uncomfortable,” US climate envoy John Kerry said in the final meeting to approve the Glasgow Climate Pact. “And this has been, I think, a good negotiation.” The agreement aims to limit global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The deal, however, is very weak on several fronts, including climate finance and loss and damage. Countries, as part of the agreement, have also agreed to meet next year to discuss further carbon cuts so that the goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius can be reached. During the formal plenary for adoption of the Glasgow Climate Pact, India and China raised objections to the draft Glasgow Climate Pact text and managed to get the changes inserted to reflect their national circumstances in the final agreement. India wanted a change in a paragraph in the draft text related to “phase out” of coal and fossil fuels to reflect the imperatives of fossil fuel subsidies for the poor in India. India asked the text to be reworded to: “Call upon parties to accelerate the development, deployment and dissemination of technologies, and adoption of policies, to transition towards low-emission energy systems, including by rapidly scaling up deployment of clean power generation and energy efficiency measures, including accelerating efforts to phase down unabated coal power and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, while providing support to poorest and the most vulnerable, in line with national circumstances, and recognising the need for support towards a just transition.” China said that following consultations with like-minded developing countries, the stakeholders also wanted the same change in wording. Several developed countries said the change watered down the Glasgow Pact but agreed to the compromise. Switzerland, on behalf of the Environment Integrity Group, expressed disappointment that “the para on coal was watered down through an intense parent process. We do not need to phase down but phase out coal and fossil fuel subsidies”. Frans Timmermans, executive vice-president of the European Commission in-charge of the European Green Deal, also expressed disappointment. “It is no secret EU would want to go even further in the initial cover text on coal... European wealth was built on coal and if we don’t get rid of coal, European death will also be built on coal. We know coal has no future. What was read out to us was a further disappointment,” he said. Brandon Wu, director policy and campaigns, Actionaid USA, however, said: “Already seeing articles blaming India for #COP26 “phase down” instead of “out” coal language. REALLY important to see full context here. The problem is not India; the problem is the US & rich countries refusing to couch fossil fuel phaseout in the context of global equity.” A senior member of the Indian delegation said: “All fossil fuels are bad for the environment. Singling out coal without talking about other fossil fuels such as natural gas is not the best way forward. But India, in the spirit of compromise, helped evolve language that was acceptable to all. This language takes care of concerns of many developing countries, including India... This gives us countries more flexibility to meet mitigation targets in line with the national circumstances and developmental needs. One-size-fits-all approach is not the best way to evolve consensus on global issues.” The Glasgow Climate Pact and the Paris Rule book were both adopted, which includes the rules for carbon markets. “India will be affected by COP26 asking countries to phase out polluting coal power and withdraw inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. India will also have to join other countries to escalate emission reduction actions more frequently. This will not be easy for a lower-middle income country that is trying to lift millions of people out of poverty,” said Ulka Kelkar, Climate Programme Director, World Resources Institute, India. The British COP26 president, Alok Sharma, was visibly emotional before banging down his gavel to signal there were no vetoes to the pact, after the talks had extended overtime – and overnight – into Saturday. “It is so decided,” said Alok Sharma, the President of COP26, as he declared the new pact after marathon talks which began earlier this month. “I hope we can leave this conference united, having delivered something significant for people and the planet together as one,” he said. Sharma said he wished he had been able to preserve the originally agreed language on phasing out coal power in the Glasgow climate deal. “Of course I wish that we had managed to preserve the language on coal that was originally agreed,” he told reporters. “Nevertheless, we do have language on coal, on phase down, and I don’t think anyone at the start of this process would have necessarily expected that that would have been retained.” He apologised for “the way this process has unfolded”. Several countries criticised the change on fossil fuels promoted by India, even as Yadav asked the Glasgow climate summit how one could expect developing nations to make promises about “phasing out” coal and fossil fuel subsidies when they have still to deal with their development agendas and poverty eradication. Earlier, at a stocktaking plenary, India made an important intervention to express its disappointment over the draft text of the agreement. The country expressed unfairness towards the developing world and pointed to a “lack of balance” and urgency around achieving climate finance targets. “Mr president (Sharma) thank you for your continued efforts to build consensus. I’m afraid, however, the consensus remained elusive. India stands ready for constructive debate and equitable and just solution in this forum,” Yadav said. The minister pointed to climate friendly lifestyles and climate justice, as enshrined in the Paris Agreement, as keys to solving the climate crisis caused by “unsustainable lifestyles and wasteful consumption patterns”. Fossil fuels and their use have enabled parts of the world to attain high levels of wealth, and targeting any particular sector is uncalled for, he said. Every country will arrive at net-zero as per its own national circumstances, strengths and weaknesses, Yadav said. “Developing countries have a right to their fair share of the global carbon budget and are entitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels within this scope,” he said."

" Environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg has dismissed a global agreement reached at the United Nations-hosted climate talks in Scotland’s Glasgow as “blah, blah, blah”. At the end of the COP26 climate summit, as nations called for a “phase down” of coal power that critics describe as a “compromise” in way of attempts to cut down on fossil fuel, Thunberg said the real work continued outside these halls and activists like her would never give up. Also Read | 'It is not a secret': Climate activist Greta Thunberg labels COP26 ‘failure’ Taking to her official handle on Twitter, Thunberg wrote, “The #COP26 is over. Here's a brief summary: Blah, blah, blah. But the real work continues outside these halls. And we will never give up, ever.” The #COP26 is over. Here’s a brief summary: Blah, blah, blah.

But the real work continues outside these halls. And we will never give up, ever. https://t.co/EOne9OogiR The youth campaigner also retweeted an earlier post of hers, where she had indicated that such ‘compromises’ in the way of climate action are equivalent to losing. “Unless we achieve immediate, drastic, unprecedented, annual emission cuts at the source then that means we're failing when it comes to this climate crisis,” she had written, adding “small steps in the right direction, “making some progress” or “winning slowly” equals losing”. The climate talks in Scotland are, however, being lauded for keeping alive hopes of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius and maintaining a realistic shot at saving the world from catastrophic climate change. Although the two-week conference in Glasgow was the 26th of its kind, it was the first to call for a reduction in fossil fuels that not only power much of the world's economy but are also the main causes of manmade global warming. WATCH | Greta Thunberg's verdict after COP26 Glasgow summit to address climate change However, there was some last-minute drama as India, backed by China and a few other coal-dependent developing nations, raised objections to this part of the agreement and asked for the wording to be rewritten. The clause was hurriedly amended to ask countries to accelerate their efforts towards a coal power “phase down” instead of “phase out”. This, Union environment and climate minister Bhupender Yadav later told Reuters, was done to reflect the “national circumstances of emerging economies”. He also expressed his apprehension over the fact that coal had been “singled out” during the COP26 talks, while there was no similar call to phase out oil or natural gas, even though rich, developed nations have historically emitted the largest share of greenhouse gases. Thunberg and other activists had earlier denounced the conference for the way it was playing out, arguing that world leaders had failed to match their words with real action. Thunberg said that pledges from some nations made during COP26 to accelerate their emissions cuts amounted to little more than “a two-week-long celebration of business as usual” and “blah, blah, blah”.

" Average global temperatures have increased by 1.07° C (0.8–1.3; likely range) relative to the 1850-1900 average—a growing trend that is likely to persist over the next few decades. Preventing further social and economic damage because of climate change requires costly mitigation and adaptation policies and technologies. Developing countries often argue that the wealthier countries should incur these costs proportionally given how, historically, their drive for industrialisation and economic growth was the main source of CO2 that accumulated in the atmosphere. Such a position draws on the principles of equity and fairness, and more specifically, the “polluter pays” notion; the international community agreed on these principles at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development or Rio Summit and formalised the notion of common but differentiated responsibilities.    At the same time, there is increasing pressure on developing countries to cut their own greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and collaborate more decisively in tackling climate change. There are at least two reasons for this: The massive economic growth of a few large developing countries over the last three decades (especially China and India); and the domestic opposition in rich countries against GHG emission cuts being prescribed only for the developed world. Therefore, requiring only the wealthy countries to cut their GHG emissions is politically non-feasible and also yields fewer effective results in mitigating climate change.    To be sure, the pressure to cut GHG emissions is stronger on China compared to its compatriots at BRICS, or the grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. However, all five countries have strong shared interests on this issue. No large country has achieved high levels of development without burning substantial amounts of fossil fuel. Therefore, promoting growth while working to mitigate (and adapt to) climate change is a relatively new agenda. Developing countries must find a way to leapfrog fossil fuel energy as a development instrument and jump straight into renewable energy sources while expanding energy infrastructure. But how can development and cutting GHG emissions be achieved simultaneously? How should emission rights be distributed? And to what extent should developed countries compensate the rest of the world for past emissions?    At one end of the spectrum of possibilities is the “grandfathering emission” proposal: “prior emissions increase entitlements to future emissions.” From this standpoint, countries will have the right to emit the same percentages of their previous emissions. However, these schemes will end up rewarding rich countries for past emissions and penalising developing ones by entitling them to a relatively small percentage of emissions. This proposal also fails to consider that in welfare terms, the marginal benefit of a raise in income (which are likely to require extra emissions) is larger for the poor. Although “grandfathering” proposals are unfair and politically unfeasible, they are an important reference point of what developing countries should avoid. At the other end is the proposal to cut GHG emissions based only on percapita terms—i.e., individuals will be entitled to a certain volume of emissions. While this proposal is fair for giving equivalent rights to people regardless of nationality and their ancestors’ behaviour, it is politically unfeasible since it will mean massive GHG cuts (and costs) in rich countries.   Moreover, neither proposal tackles the problem of what to do with past emissions; rich countries’ emissions are the main cause of current levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, but they have not paid for the negative externalities they produce. While developing countries should seek to become carbon-neutral by the years 2050-60, doing so at the same speed as the wealthy countries will likely not be achievable. Developing countries must pressure rich countries to adopt more robust emission cuts and provide compensations for past emissions, which should be allocated for climate change mitigation and adaptation in developing countries. They should also seek to turn the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities into a universally accepted norm.

" Talks at the 26th edition of the climate change conference (COP26) in Glasgow entered the crucial final stages of negotiations, with a key grouping of developing countries, which includes India and China, raising objections against some segments of the draft proposal, decrying what they said would amount to “carbon colonialism” by rich nations. Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) said the draft document on the outcome of the summit – particularly its focus on the 1.5°C target for all countries -- is reinventing the terms of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which made a differentiation in climate action and ambition. “The Paris Agreement has a delicate balance which we cannot rewrite. There should be differentiation in climate action and ambition. There should also be recognition of the pre-2020 ambition gap. If we go ahead with the proposal of net-zero by 2050 for all countries, the developing world will be trapped. We do not have the technological and financial means to achieve such targets. This narrative will allow the developed world to control the world with carbon colonialism. Developing countries will be ethically and financially condemned for not complying,” said Diego Pacheco, lead negotiator of Bolivia on behalf of LMDC. Pacheco added that 60% of the carbon space was occupied by developed countries with only 18% of the world population, and that the historical responsibility of these regions in causing the climate crisis cannot be ignored. They instead proposed to the COP26 presidency that there be recognition of this historical responsibility and the limited carbon space in the final deal, and that developed countries should achieve full decarbonisation with real and immediate reduction of emissions within this decade. Developed countries are classified as Annex I nations. It also states that India, on behalf of BASIC — a bloc of four countries comprising Brazil, South Africa, India and China — said the draft material lacked balance and while the mitigation section – which deals with steps on reducing emissions offered a highly “prescriptive” approach. The proposals are strong on revising the NDCs, or nationally determined contributions, by 2022, in annual ministerial roundtables and updating long-term strategies, but such an approach is not reflected in judging how climate finance is made available. “The announcements here in Glasgow are encouraging but they are far from enough. The emissions gap remains a devastating threat. The finance and adaptation gap represent a glaring injustice for the developing world. We need even more ambition in the future revised NDCs. We need pledges to be implemented. We need commitments to turn concrete. We need actions to be verified. We need to bridge the deep and real credibility gap,” UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said in a statement on Thursday. “We cannot settle for the lowest common denominator. Keeping the 1.5 goal within reach means reducing emissions globally by 45% by 2030. But the present set of NDCs — even if fully implemented — will still increase emissions by 2030,” he added. According to Third World Network, a non-profit international research and advocacy organisation focusing on North-South affairs, the developed countries were happy with the draft text on mitigation which mentioned the goal of 1.5°C."
" Our worst fears have been confirmed. Human-induced climate change is already causing severe weather events across the world, impacting the lives and livelihoods of millions. The first tranche of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report is a grim reminder of the make-or-break choices that we need to make in a 1.5°C-breaching climate. The IPCC report reiterates the dire consequences of this human-induced breach for the Indian subcontinent: Increased dry spells, intensification of extreme rainfall by more than 20%, and an exponential surge in heatwaves and cyclonic events. As global warming reaches a tipping point, India’s growth is linked intricately with climate risks. Such risks have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable communities with low adaptive capacities and pose a critical threat to India’s sustainable development. Investments in infrastructure such as housing, transport, and industries will be threatened, especially along the coasts. Further, with mounting weather-related insurance losses, climate change could trigger the next financial crisis. This study undertakes a first-of-its-kind district-level vulnerability assessment of India, which maps exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity using spatio-temporal analysis. To do this, we developed a climate vulnerability index (CVI) of Indian states and Union Territories (UTs). A CVI will help map critical vulnerabilities; plan strategies to enhance resilience, and adapt by climate-proofing communities, economies and infrastructure. Instead of looking at climate extremes in isolation, we map the combined risk of hydro-met disasters and their compounded impacts on vulnerability. By doing so, we aim to inform policy goals in the resource-constrained context of India. Why does India need a climate vulnerability index? India is the seventh-most vulnerable country with respect to climate extremes (Germanwatch 2020). Climate action needs to be scaled up both at the sub-national and district levels to mitigate the impact of extreme events. An analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) suggests that three out of four districts in India are extreme event hotspots, with 40% of the districts exhibiting a swapping trend, i.e., traditionally flood-prone areas are witnessing more frequent and intense droughts and vice-versa. Further, the IPCC states with high confidence that every degree rise in temperature will lead to a three per cent increase in precipitation, causing increased intensification of cyclones and floods. This is especially concerning since global, regional, national, and subnational climate actions are geared towards limiting the rise in the earth’s temperature to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. However, storms are already intensifying into cyclones, droughts are affecting more than half of the country, and floods of unprecedented scale are causing catastrophic loss and damage. These trends are the result of a mere 0.6–0.7°C rise in temperature in the last 100 years (IMD 2019). Thus, there is a pressing need to consider the consequences of a 2°C target. Various studies by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the Department of Science & Technology (DST) have highlighted the importance of robust micro-level vulnerability assessments. Given the absence of such an assessment in India, this study undertakes an integrated mapping of exposure (the nature and degree to which a system is exposed), sensitivity (the degree to which a system is affected), and adaptive capacity (the ability of a system to adjust to climate change) using spatio-temporal analysis. Equation ES1 enumerates the vulnerability function. Managing climate risks requires an enhanced understanding of the underlying drivers of hazards; the exposure of regions and populations; the sensitivity of regions and their resulting vulnerability; and the interactions between these components, as highlighted by the IPCC. While exposure to extreme events is linear, the impacts are non-linear, depending on the sensitivity and adaptive capacity of the affected systems. For some, it may entail adjustments and re-adjustments in livelihood options, but, for others, the impacts can be catastrophic, compounding beyond existing vulnerability thresholds. Thus, identifying the compounding impacts of risk and mapping the vulnerability of geographies and communities is a national imperative. The assessment maps the frequency and intensity of exposure of Indian districts to hydro-met extremes and associated events. Further, these data are integrated with a spatial mapping of the sensitivity of landscape indicators (land-use-land-cover, soil moisture, groundwater, slope, and elevation) to climate extremes. We also assess adaptive capacity by considering a wide set of socio-economic indicators such as population density, GDDP, literacy ratio, sex ratio, availability and accessibility of critical infrastructures, availability and accessibility of shelters, and robustness of district disaster management plans (DDMPs). Extreme event indicators were shortlisted through stakeholder consultations to capture the on-ground consensus regarding the drivers of vulnerability at a micro-scale. In line with the IPCC’s SREX framework and the DST common vulnerability assessment approach, we propose that climate extremes should not be seen as primary events; instead, the combined risk of associated events should be mapped. Thus, we capture the combined risk of hydro-met disasters and their compounded impact on districts’ climate vulnerability. We find that the pattern of extreme events is changing across regions and that more than 40% of Indian districts exhibit a swapping trend. Tackling these complex, varying patterns requires concerted risk mitigation strategies at the sub-national level. Our analysis suggests that the CVIs of Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Bihar are in the high range, making them the five most vulnerable states in India. However, there are marginal differences in the vulnerability of these states, so it is imperative to step up climate action in all of them. The CVI also helps map the vulnerability of populations residing in Indian districts. We find that more than 80% of India’s population lives in districts highly vulnerable to extreme hydro-met disasters The analysis shows that 27 of 35 states and UTs are highly vulnerable to extreme hydro-met disasters and their compounded impacts. Our analysis suggests that India’s western and central zones are more vulnerable to drought-like conditions and their compounding impacts. The northern and north-eastern zones are more vulnerable to extreme flood events and their compounding impacts. Meanwhile, India’s eastern and southern zones are highly vulnerable to extreme cyclonic events and their impacts. The eastern and southern zones are also becoming extremely prone to cyclones, floods, and droughts combined. We find that the southern and western regions are the most vulnerable to extreme droughts and are affected year on year. These regions are predominantly affected by agricultural droughts. Since the 2000s, the northern, eastern, and central zones have been moderately vulnerable and are predominantly affected by meteorological and agricultural droughts. The north-eastern region is least vulnerable to extreme drought events. Our composite indexing suggests that more than 59% of districts located in the eastern zone are highly vulnerable to extreme cyclone events. In the western zone, more than 41% of districts are cyclone hotspots. Our analysis shows that the western coast has become increasingly vulnerable to cyclones in the last decade (2010–2019). India’s northern and north-eastern zones face very few extreme cyclone events and are therefore less vulnerable. The central zone is the only zone in India with no hotspots for extreme cyclone events. Increased drought-like conditions across India trigger the cyclogenesis process by which depressions turn into deep depressions, and deep depressions into cyclonic storms across the rapidly warming Indian Ocean. Since these cyclones are accompanied by floods, several districts across the eastern and western coasts are vulnerable to all three extremes. This makes mitigation and adaptation in these regions a daunting task. A surge in extreme events has been observed across India after 2005. Our sensitivity analysis shows that this is primarily triggered by landscape disruptions. Various studies have confirmed the impact of landscape changes on the incidence of extreme events. Other factors, such as the urban heat island effect, land subsidence, and microclimate changes, are also triggering the intensification of extreme events in India. Building India’s climate resilience In an increasingly volatile climate landscape, hyper-local strategies can minimise impacts and avert or reduce loss and damage. The CVI intends to evaluate the vulnerability of Indian districts in a comparable unified matrix and identify the major landscape and socio-economic drivers of vulnerability. This will enable communities to map, plan and adapt against the climate extremes. With less than a decade left to step up climate actions, our policies need a razor-sharp focus to curtail the compounded impacts of climate extremes. Principles of risk assessment should be at the core of India’s climate risk mitigation strategy. Identifying risk is the first and foremost step to building climate-proofed economies and societies that embrace climateresilient pathways. Based on our analysis, we make the following recommendations: Develop a high-resolution Climate Risk Atlas (CRA) to map critical vulnerabilities at the district level and better identify, assess, and project chronic and acute risks such as extreme climate events, heat and water stress, crop loss, vector-borne diseases and biodiversity collapse. A CRA can also support coastal monitoring and forecasting, which are indispensable given the rapid intensification of cyclones and other extreme events. Establish a centralised climate-risk commission to coordinate the environmental derisking mission. Undertake climate-sensitivity-led landscape restoration focused on rehabilitating, restoring, and reintegrating natural ecosystems as part of the developmental process. Integrate climate risk profiling with infrastructure planning to increase adaptive capacity. Provide for climate risk-interlinked adaptation financing by creating innovative CVI-based financing instruments that integrate climate risks for an effective risk transfer mechanism. India urgently needs national and sub-national strategies to climate-proof its population and economic growth. If a 1.5°C warmer future climate is inevitable, we must brace for its impacts and ensure that we have the means to build back better and faster when disaster strikes. If we fail, we could set our development story back by decades. The study has been accessed by clicking here."
" The global community was taken by surprise when our Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the commitment that India will achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2070. While the target has been set and commendably so, achieving it will require some serious and sustained commitment and efforts from not just the government but each of us. In simple terms each of us need to curtail our wasteful consumption and be conscious of our carbon footprint. We need to constantly remind ourselves and those around that everything that we do has a direct bearing on our natural environment which in turn affects our own well-being. That we are a developing economy is also a blessing in disguise and a great opportunity for each of us to grow responsibly.  To achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2070, we need appropriate funding and transfer of technology by the more resourceful developed nations. We have wasted two and a half decades highlighting this at various COPs but not much has changed. There seems to be a clear contradiction in what some of the developed nations preach and practice. They really need to walk the talk now and if not lead by example at least follow us and make real commitments. Their statements in the media cannot be in contradiction to the stand they take in closed door climate negotiations.  India is already making serious efforts towards climate change adaptation and mitigation. By the year 2030 we have already committed to exceed our non-fossil fuel energy capacity target which includes meeting 50% of our energy requirement through renewable energy, reducing our carbon emissions by one billion tonnes, reducing carbon intensity in our economy by 45%, making Indian Railway, the world's largest railway carrier achieve net zero carbon emissions, saving 40 billion tonnes of emissions through LEDs etc. For a developing economy this is no easy task and a huge sacrifice in the collective global interest.  Since the developed nations have only made promises towards technology transfer and climate finance thus far without contributing anything, we cannot only rely on them to achieve our targets. The private sector like always will have to step in and contribute significantly. We will have to reimagine ways to reduce the emissions by energy-intensive sectors. Clean mobility, not just private but more importantly public, is the only way forward. We need to sustain our focus on improving energy efficiency and continue the already commendable work that we are doing in this regard. The ministry of environment, forest and climate change needs to focus much more on climate change and devise strategies and programmes to achieve the net-zero target we have set for ourselves for 2070. This may not require creating new institutions or enacting new laws but it will definitely require revising our existing laws suitably and making their implementation stronger. The regulators have to empowered financially and technically to take necessary steps and work proactively towards reducing our emissions, conserving and increasing our forest cover to one-third of our total area, if not more, protecting our once rich and precious biological diversity, cleaning our air and water bodies and managing our waste more efficiently.  A lot of these things are easier said than done but then we neither have the luxury of time, nor do we have adequate resources. Some may call it over-commitment on our part but then it is only in our interest and the interest of our future generations to make sure that we do not waste any further time and strive for our survival, strive to save humanity. While at it, we must also make sure that we do this while improving the living standards of the poor and ensuring that the quality of their lives improve. Whether this also means rethinking our pollution-control strategy could be a discussion for another day but we definitely need to make sure that our rush towards achieving net-zero also ensures equity and quality life for a major percentage of our population which has unfortunately been deprived of it for ages.  "
" The outcome of the 26th edition of the climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland, should focus on preserving the determined nature of NDCs, or nationally determined contributions, corresponding to their highest possible ambition in the light of different national circumstances, BASIC, which is a bloc of four countries comprising Brazil, South Africa, India and China, said on Wednesday. This means that BASIC doesn’t support uniform NDC commitments and timelines for all countries, like a net zero emissions target by 2050. In a joint statement, the four countries said that the outcome of the ongoing summit should reflect equity and principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC), in light of different national circumstances, as stated in the Paris Agreement, concluding the negotiations related to Article 6 (carbon markets) of the agreement and signalling to developed country Parties to fulfill their financial obligations without further delay were of priority to them. The grouping also sought specific information on the provision of technical, financial and capacity-building resources to developing countries representing a progression beyond previous efforts, recognising the significant role of public funds in climate finance. It highlighted that BASIC and other developing countries had made the first move, coming forward with high ambition, despite not bearing historical responsibility for climate change. The grouping now expects developed countries to show leadership in the matter, it said. The ministers of the four countries also expressed concern that climate finance provided by developed countries have fallen short of the USD 100 billion per year-commitment by 2020, and that finance tends to be provided with unilateral conditionality and eligibility criteria as well as in the form of loans, rather than grants, which aggravates the debt crisis. “Developed countries must urgently step forward to fulfil their obligations and mobilise at least USD 100 billion per year from 2021 to 2025, and initiate, at COP 26, deliberations on a formal, transparent and open process for setting a new collective quantified goal on finance, under the Paris Agreement, including through an inclusive forum for deliberation with a detailed roadmap outlining milestones for adopting a goal no later than 2023,” the statement said. The new collective quantified goal must build from a floor of USD 100 billion per year, be significantly publicly-funded with greater transparency and predictability, and take a balanced approach towards mitigation and adaptation in light of the needs and priorities of developing countries, the countries said. “The ministers emphasised that trust amongst parties is central to the success of a multilateral process and that climate change can only be successfully addressed through a collective multilateral response. The history of negotiations and the past commitments must not be forgotten or erased. In this spirit, it must be ensured that the discussions on pre-2020 action and support are not relegated to the background in this COP,” the statement added. The BASIC meeting was chaired by environment minister Bhupender Yadav and attended by Joaquim Leite, Brazil environment minister, Xie Zhenhua, China special envoy"
" The COP26 climate conference that is to end on Friday entered its business end with the UK presidency team of COP releasing two draft agreements, aka cover decision, that set out some ambitious targets, including meeting the global warming target agreed upon in Paris in 2015, and the phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies, although India and other developing countries may yet push for stronger wording on the quantum and timing of climate finance. One of the drafts, CMA.3, is basically a draft by the group of nations that were signatories to the 2015 Paris agreement; the other CP.26, was by the Conference of Parties. The CMA.3 draft is the one with more details on important issues, and will be the one discussed over the next two days. Broadly, the draft urges countries to come back by the end of next year (2022) with stiffer emission reduction targets for themselves that will help meet the Paris target of keeping global waring to 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels ; recognises the need to double climate finance for developing and vulnerable countries; asks the UN chief to call for a meeting of leaders in 2023 to review the 2030 targets; and asks for the accelerated phasing out of the use of coal and of fossil fuel subsidies (without putting a deadline to these). Without specifics, this is pretty much what anyone could have hoped to achieve in Glasgow in a best-case scenario, but it is the specifics that are likely to become contentious. Talks (or negotiations and bargaining) over the next few days will focus on these specifics. The decisions that COP will finally decide on are binding, although the final decision can also only be arrived at through consensus, which means the next two days are likely to see frenetic efforts by various groupings to shape the language to their advantage. The draft, proposed by COP26 president Alok Sharma, underlines the Paris Agreement temperature goal of capping the rise in the average global temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and also calls for pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. It recognises that keeping global warming to under 1.5°C requires meaningful and effective action by all parties, reflecting common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities in the light of different national circumstances. “The text doesn’t crisply, clearly articulate the 1.5 degree goal. It’s still a bit fuzzy,” said David Waskow, international climate director, World Resources Institute. Meeting the 1.5°C goal would require reducing global CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to reach net zero by around mid-century. But the aggregate greenhouse gas emission level, taking into account implementation of all nationally determined contributions (NDCs) submitted, is estimated to be 13.7% above the 2010 level in 2030, the draft states. It is in that context that the revision of NDCs by 2022 becomes significant -- previously, countries were expected to do so only every five years, which would have meant 2025 or 2026 for most countries. On climate finance, the draft urges developed countries to provide financial resources to developing nations with respect to both mitigation and adaptation, in continuation of their existing obligations under the convention. It also encourages all parties to provide such support voluntarily. It also calls upon “developed countries to at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation”. Developing countries , including India, would have wanted more from the draft, but may have feared even less, and they will now push for quantifying this commitment and putting a timeline to it. The developed world, as evident from their stance over the past few days, will oppose this, and also seek to redefine climate finance to include investments from private companies, and not just grants. Waskow added that a positive development in the draft is that parties have been urged to come forward by 2022 with revisited, improved NDCs. It also has language on phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies which have been named specifically in the text, perhaps for the first time. This is also an issue that is likely to see the most jockeying. A significant inclusion in the draft is a “work programme” on enhancing mitigation targets and “implementation during the critical decade of the 2020s”. If this finds a way in the final agreement, it means mitigation targets and achievements (in terms of emissions) will be tracked regularly, at least in every future COP, analysts explained."
" Two different analyses have concluded that the new nationally determined contributions (NDCs) announced at Glasgow climate change conference last week and the statements about raising of ambitions may lead to little concrete outcomes, and global climate is still headed for a catastrophic warming of around 2.4 to 2.7°C over pre-industrial levels. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) released an update to their emissions gap report 2021 on Tuesday, considering 33 new mitigation pledges for 2030 (31 in NDCs and 2 in other announcements as of 4 November 2021) made since September. The total number of mitigation pledges for 2030 considered is now 152, covering 88% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Since the report released on October 26, 25 additional countries have announced net-zero emissions pledges, implying that 76% of global domestic emissions are now covered by net-zero announcements. When the latest unconditional and conditional NDCs are considered, warming is projected to be limited to 2.7°C (range: 2.2°C–3.1°C) over pre-industrial levels. This means that there is no change in warming impact compared to UNEP’s assessment released on October 26. When the full implementation of all net-zero pledges are considered in addition to the updated unconditional and conditional NDCs, warming is projected to be limited to 2.1°C (range: 1.9°C–2.3°C). “Great to see countries submit stretched NDCs. But the reality is that the sum total of our #climate efforts thus far is like an elephant giving birth to a mouse. When we gavel #COP26, we need to close the leadership gap,” tweeted Inger Andersen, executive director, UNEP. During a press conference to release the updated findings Andersen flagged that most net zero pledges are vague, untransparent and hard to hold to account. She highlighted some were for GHG emissions while some only for CO2 emissions. “There is a very large credibility gap. Glasgow was the first real test of Paris Agreement’s ratcheting up mechanism. But the ambition gap is massive and unlikely to be addressed in next few days,” Andersen said. The unconditional pledges made between the September cut-off date of the Emissions Gap Report 2021 and 4 November 2021 have narrowed the gap with respect to 2°C and 1.5°C by about 0.5 GtCO2e (gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent); if the conditional pledges are also fully implemented the gap has been narrowed by about 1.5 GtCO2e. “These changes do not affect the conclusion of the Emissions Gap Report 2021 that a significant increase in 2030 mitigation pledge ambition and acceleration of action is required to get the world on a path consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goal. Even considering the recent updated pledges for 2030, annual global GHG emissions would need to be roughly halved by 2030 to become consistent with a 1.5°C pathway,” a UNEP statement said. “Glasgow has a massive credibility, action and commitment gap as the world is heading to at least 2.4°C of warming, if not more,” the Climate Action Tracker, a scientific analysis organisation also warned at a press conference at COP26 on Tuesday. With all target pledges, including those made in Glasgow, global greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 will still be around twice as high as necessary for the 1.5°C limit, CAT states, adding that with 2030 pledges alone (without longer term net zero targets) there is likely to be warming of 2.4°C. The projected warming from current policies – what countries are actually doing – is even higher, at 2.7°C, CAT flagged. In CAT’s best case scenario when all net zero pledges are implemented, warming can be limited to around 1.8°C. A separate modelling showed one billion people will be at risk of extreme heat stress if global warming causes the world’s temperature to rise by 2°C. A study by the Met Office, the UK’s national meteorological service, warned that a 2°C rise could lead to a 15-fold increase of a potentially fatal cocktail of heat and humidity across the planet. A 4°C rise would mean that nearly half of the world’s population could be living in affected areas, according to the research."
" India will not update its NDCs, or nationally determined contributions, to reflect the pledges made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Climate Leader’s Summit at Glasgow on November 1 and 2, which was part of the ongoing climate conference (COP 26), until there is clarity on climate finance, a senior member of the Indian delegation said on condition of anonymity. The delegate’s comment comes even as developed countries continue to quibble about the size and timing of their climate funding commitment ($100 billion a year by 2020 was promised back in 2009), including deferring a decision on the most sticky point of COP 26 to the next summit, COP 27, in 2022. India alone will need $1 trillion by 2030 to fund its decarbonisation efforts and build its renewable energy capacity, the Indian delegate added. “ We will need $1 trillion till 2030 mainly for renewable energy and storage; decarbonisation of industrial sector and adaptation. Let’s be clear that India will not update its NDCs till there is clarity on climate finance. We are in no mood to submit them until these issues are resolved,” the Indian delegate stressed. Last week, during his speech at the summit, Modi, who made five pledges including a net zero deadline, also asked for enhanced climate finance. “It is India’s expectation that the world’s developed nations make $1 trillion available as climate finance as soon as possible,” Modi said, announcing that India will increase its non-fossil fuel energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030; fulfil 50% of its energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2030; reduce its total projected carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes between now and 2030; reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by 45% by 2030; and achieve the target of net zero emissions by 2070. India released a statement on Monday evening stating that it expects a structured process to arrive at an ambitious new collective quantified finance goal. “We record our deep disappointment with the deliberations in the COP 26 so far. Developed countries must accept the historical responsibility and provide the financial resources to the developing countries,” the statement for the first high level ministerial dialogue on climate finance presented by Chandni Raina advisor, department of economic affairs, said. The global action on climate change is contingent on the delivery of timely and adequate finance, India said, adding that “developed countries took a commitment in 2009 to mobilize $100 billion per year by 2020 for climate action by developing countries. The promise has not been met. Scaling up mobilization is pertinent given the huge gap between the requirement and extent of mobilisation.” India made it clear that the resources mobilised must be new and additional, climate-specific, and with an emphasis on public finance -- a move that comes even as some developed countries seek to expand the definition of climate finance to include private sector investments.       "
                  
" India flagged that developed countries are trying to renegotiate who or which countries will provide resources for climate change mitigation, and how often nationally determined contributions (NDCs) will be updated, violating principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR, under which countries take climate action as per their respective capabilities) . During an informal stock taking of negotiations by Glasgow climate change conference (COP 26) President, Alok Sharma on Monday, India’s lead negotiator, Richa Sharma on behalf of BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India, and China) countries said these issues are already specified in the Paris Agreement and should not be renegotiated. The Paris Agreement specifies that climate finance and technology support should flow from developed to developing countries. HT reported on Sunday that there are talks of including some developing countries particularly China, Saudi Arabia, even India as donors for the post 2025 new climate finance goal. India has also flagged the erosion of trust due to developed countries’ failure to deliver the $100 billion-a-year fund. “It’s been over a decade that the $100 billion was promised and the world is still waiting which is why trust in multilateralism at stake. There should be a structured process for a new higher finance goal which is a simple ask from developing countries”, she said. If not resolved this will jeopardise net zero commitments of parties and NDCs, Sharma added. India expects credible carbon markets and not cheap offsets, she pointed out. “Trust in multilateralism and credibility of the process is at stake. Post-2020 mitigation ambition and net zero pledges require significantly enhanced climate finance...BASIC would like to warn that lack of a serious approach to climate finance will jeopardize the enhanced mitigation and adaptation ambition as well as net zero pledges of parties,” she added. India’s view is seconded by many developing countries. Bolivia’s lead negotiator, Diego Pacheco, on behalf of Like Minded Developing Countries said: “ Let’s be honest they don’t want to define finance, talk about loss and damage, new finance goal. How can finance be achieved like this? The history of broken promises and unfulfilled commitments has a strong bearing of where we are today.” According to him, the principles of equity and CBDR are non-negotiable. Developed nations are resisting demands for a new finance goal for the post 2025 period, financial compensation for loss and damage, and an independent review of the promised $100 billion-a-year financing. “The stakes could not be higher for countries, communities and peoples on the front lines of the climate crisis... This is a race that we cannot afford to lose. It’s remarkable that [after] close to 30 years of international climate negotiations, adaptation finance represents a mere 25 %of total climate finance, despite what we know and what we’re seeing and experiencing all over the world,” said Selwin Hart, Special Adviser to the UN Secretary-General on Climate Action during his address at COP26 However, Frans Timmermans, executive vice-president of the European Commission in-charge of the European Green Deal during a press conference by EU at COP 26 said: “We are very serious about the delivery of the USD 100 billion. Once delivered there can be some serious discussion on the post 2025 new finance goal.” Meanwhile climate economist, Nicholas Stern said on Monday that India had made among the “most important” NDC announcements."
" India’s pledge was among the most substantive contributions at Glasgow climate change conference, Nicholas Stern, one of the world’s pre-eminent climate economists and Chair of the Grantham Research Institute at London School of Economics said on Monday during a meeting with journalists. “PM Modi’s panchamrit (nectar distilled from five ingredients; in this case, the five promises) was among the most substantive at COP26. Institutional reform will be needed to implement those which has already begun,” he said.    India is focused on solar, green hydrogen and decarbonising the Railways by 2030 on all of which it will see tremendous returns, Stern explained -- but it will also need financial investments running into hundreds of billions of dollars. Some of this will come from public finance, some from external finance, and it will also come, increasingly, from companies looking for clean investment opportunities to meet their own pledges. India has to make itself an attractive destination for these companies, Stern said. He things COP26 will help to some extent. “I look at it like this: before Paris we were headed for 4 degree warming, after Paris it was 3 degree warming, after Glasgow it could be 2 degree warming.” He also thinks the ongoing summit was “unusual” because “PMs and Presidents came before the negotiations and declared their vision” an also because the “private sector is here in large numbers”. The first indicates intent and the second means companies “are looking for opportunities to invest”. And he thinks Indian PM Narendra Modi’s pledge was “among the most important”. “There has been progress on decarbonising steel sector, green hydrogen and electric vehicles in all of which India can play a major role.,” he said. Stern and Amar Bhattacharya, visiting professor in practice at Grantham Research Institute at LSE released a policy paper titled “Beyond the $100 billion: financing a sustainable and resilient future” which said developed countries’ commitment to mobilise $100 billion a year by 2020 to support developing countries on climate action is both an intensely important symbol of trust and foundational to progress on climate action by developing countries. Donors collectively fell short of the goal in 2020, but there is an opportunity to step up and deliver in 2022, it added. The paper also said that donors must double bilateral climate finance to $60 billion by 2025 from its 2018 level, and multilateral development banks (MDBs), triple their level of financing by 2025 from their 2018 levels. India will meet 50% of its energy needs from renewable energy sources and transition to net zero emissions by 2070, PM Narendra Modi said in his national statement during the World Leaders Summit last week in Glasgow."
" Mohini, who is in her 50s, migrated to Haryana from Shahjahanpur, in search of employment, earlier this year. She couldn’t work as an agricultural labourer back at home, because, she said, the extended rain had made it hard for landowners. When I met her, she was removing water hyacinth from acres of mud flats. The owner mentioned the rains had flooded his fields, turning them into shallow ponds. He lost a season of farming plus spent money to clear the land when it dried. Hundreds of thousands of climate impacted landowners and workers exist. Who will pay for their loss and damage? Who will pay for them to adapt to a new era?   "
" Ahead of the second week of the COP26 summit, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on Sunday released the preliminary draft text of the cover decision, or what may be called the Glasgow Pact, emphasising on the need for urgent efforts to achieve the 1.5 degrees Celsius target. The presidency summary of possible elements also talks about keeping the temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius, the importance of responding to the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on pre-2030 action, transitioning to global net zero by 2050 and the carbon budget. Several governments, including India, have made key announcements over climate financing, net-zero commitments, pledges to end deforestation by 2030, and a US- and EU-led pledge to slash methane emissions by 30% by 2030, in the first week of the conference. Over 40 countries also pledged to phase out coal in a separate event at COP26. India, China, Australia and US did not sign that pledge. Calling for international collaboration, the document also highlights the need to “scale up finance flows to developing countries” and expresses “deep concern that the $100bn goal has not yet been met”. At COP15 in 2009, developed countries committed to mobilising jointly $100 billion a year by 2020. “NEW “Non paper” on “possible elements” of crucial #COP26 “cover decision” ...It’s a grab-bag of everything that could be included, not yet drafted in legalese, from “keeping 1.5C alive” to human rights to loss & damage finance,” tweeted Simon Evans, policy editor of Carbon Brief, a website that focuses on climate change politics and policies. While experts said that the elements from the draft text will be negotiated on later in the week, the text does not have any details on the market mechanism or carbon trading element. HT on Sunday reported that the delivery and review of the $100 billion climate finance that was agreed on in 2009; whether that amount is increased after 2025 period; and the 1.5degrees Celsius target, were the three major sticking points that could make or break global efforts to mitigate the climate crisis. India, the third largest carbon emitter, has committed to a net-zero goal by 2070 in its five-point action plan, that also included reducing emissions to 50% by 2030. On Sunday, JR Bhatt, representing India, said that its solar energy capacity has increased 17 times in the last seven years, and now stands at 45 gigawatts. Bhatt is an adviser in the ministry of environment. During a presentation on India’s third Biennial Update Report (BUR) during the 11th Facilitative Sharing of Views (FSV) at the summit, Bhatt highlighted that India represents 17 per cent of the global population but its historical cumulative emissions are only 4 per cent, while current annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are only about 5 per cent. The BUR was submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in February. The key highlight of the discussion on India’s third BUR was the achievement of 24 per cent reduction in emission intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over the period of 2005-2014, and the significant increase of its solar programme. “This is complemented by the fact that India is particularly vulnerable to climate change. However, India is nevertheless taking several mitigation actions, spanning across the entire economy and society and has progressively continued decoupling of its economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions,” said Bhatt. In the last seven years, India’s installed solar energy capacity has increased 17 times, he said, adding that the solar energy capacity now stands at about 45 gigawatts. On the question of an increase in forest cover, India responded that people’s participation has played an important role in enhancing its forest cover, and that its forests provide all the four ecosystem services. India highlighted that it speaks on climate change from a position of strength and responsibility. “India’s 15 per cent of total carbon dioxide emission in 2016 was removed from the atmosphere by the LULUCF (Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry). Between 2015 and 2019, the forest and tree cover increased by 13,031 square kilometer and mangrove cover increased by 235 square kilometer. Populations of Asiatic lions, elephants, rhinos increased manifold in the last 5 to 6 years,” India’s statement at the UN said. “We emphasise that India is particularly vulnerable to climate change, a point which many friends overlook in their eagerness to understand our mitigation efforts. To follow a sustainable path to development, India has taken several mitigation actions. There is no sector that has been left untouched while planning and implementing climate mitigation actions. They span across the entire economy and society,” the statement added."
" Sheikh Abdul Rauf, now 50, has watched the sea invade his land. His hut is ramshackle, a combination of years of poverty and devastation from repeated cyclones. But until three years ago, he had land. The walk to sea, past his agricultural land, was about 25 minutes. Now, he watches the water 15 metres away from his hut, and contemplates the inevitable. His land has gone, his home may, too. His father once told him that they had several hectares of land on the island. “But gradually almost all our land disappeared due to rising water levels. Now, I have a few bighas left, but there is no telling how long those will remain,” Rauf said. Rauf is one of about 3,000 residents of Ghoramara, a remote island in the Sunderbans, the world’s largest delta known for its Royal Bengal Tigers and mangroves. And yet, Ghoramara now has another narrative. Of rising sea levels, and untimely cyclones, all the effects of the climate crisis. And even as nations make pledges at COP26, and leaders of the world converge in Glasgow to thrash out the way forward, in the Sunderbans, on India’s east coast, the climate crisis is in the here and now. In its latest state of the climate report, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said that sea levels between 2013 and 2021 had risen by a factor of two, meaning sea level rises have doubled in this period. The WMO report said the mean global sea level rise was 2.1mm per year between 1993 and 2002 and 4.4mm per year between 2013 and 2021. In the coming years, WMO predicted that sea levels will rise further if the climate crisis-causing carbon emissions are not checked quickly. In India, the ministry of earth sciences told the Lok Sabha this July that the sea level in the northern parts of the Indian Ocean had risen by 6.1mm per year between 2003 and 2013. The sea level rise is higher on the eastern coast, the ministry said. Chairman of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board, Kalyan Rudra, said the rate of land disappearing in the Sunderbans was even higher. “In the Sunderbans, the rise is much more because of the subsidence of land. While the IPCC report 2019 says the sea level is rising by 3.6mm every year, the delta is subsiding by 2.9 mm every year. These two put together show that water is gobbling up land at the rate of 6.5mm per year,” said Rudra, a noted river expert. For Rauf, these terms and numbers are unfamiliar, but the evidence is before his eyes. “I don’t know what is causing the abrupt rise in the sea currents. Maybe, it is God’s wrath against us,”he said.

" Staffordshire University graduate Rachael Carver and Professor Fiona Tweed have investigated the impacts of melting snow and ice on the future of tourism. The findings of the study were published in the journal 'Geography'. The study is based on field research that Rachael undertook in the European Alps for her dissertation and highlights how resorts are introducing a range of measures to prolong the ski season including glacier blankets and artificial snow. BSc (Hons) Geography graduate Rachael explained: ""At university, I developed a passion for understanding human interaction with the environment and the importance of climate change."" ""I visited the Stubai Glacier in Austria on holiday and was intrigued by the fact that they were trying to conserve the ski industry. It left me asking lots of questions so I decided to go back and learn more,"" Rachael added. The site uses protective blankets to reduce ice melting and wind erosion. It is also slowly transitioning from winter to summer tourism with new attractions including playgrounds and viewing platforms. Rachael surveyed tourists and, despite these environmental changes, 70 per cent said that they would return to the site if the glaciers were not there, citing mountains, scenery and hiking opportunities as reasons. Resorts around the world are using similar strategies and many rely on snow machines. However, the use of most snow and ice generation and conservation measures are caught up in a loop of unsustainability, consuming energy that contributes to climate change. Rachael said: ""At the rate, we're losing glaciers, doing nothing is not an option for these industries. There will be a lot of people adversely affected by the economic impact of not having this tourism."" ""It was interesting seeing different solutions to the issue. Most places understand that these practices aren't a long-term solution, but it is buying them time. I think adaptation is key. Yes, they were designed as ski resorts but they can be turned into something else with a little bit of foresight and planning,"" Rachael added. Rachael believes that resorts should provide visitors with opportunities to explore mountain environments in different ways; for example, by introducing hiking routes, mountain bike trails, viewing platforms and educational attractions. The study also explores more innovative solutions such as grass skiing which has been introduced by resorts in the Czech Republic where there is often only one month of reliable snow each year. Fiona, Professor of Physical Geography, said: ""It was a pleasure to collaborate with Rachael to get her undergraduate research published. I worked with her as I would any research co-worker; we drafted an outline plan together and had regular meetings to review progress and share ideas."" ""Climate change is the defining issue of our time with many far-reaching impacts and implications. Several students in Rachael's year group did projects that had climate change at their core. We're looking forward to equipping more students with the skills to work on climate change-related issues as part of our new BSc (Hons) Climate Change and Society degree,"" Fiona added. ""Having my dissertation research published is something that I never imagined would happen! I feel really privileged to have had Fiona help me - she has been a great support and is the one who made me go for it. My lecturers also helped motivate me to do a Masters degree and supported me in applications for jobs which led to my current role at the Coal Authority,"" she added."
" Earlier this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged at the COP26 UN climate conference in Glasgow that India will achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. Speaking at the ‘High-Level Segment for Heads of State and Government’ during the UNFCCC’s 26th Conference of Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, the Indian Prime Minister also announced that the country would make one billion-tonne reduction in projected emissions from now until 2030. Ramping up India's fight against climate change and global warming, Modi also announced several ambitious targets for the country.  Clean energy goals He enhanced India’s target for installed renewable energy capacity by 2030 from 450GW to 500GW, and also said that 50% of India's total electricity would be generated from renewable energy sources by 2030 – an increase of 10% from the earlier target of 40%.  Calling the targets the “gift of five elixirs” (panchamrit), Modi also said That India's emissions intensity, or emissions per unit GDP, will be reduced by at least 45% by 2030 from the 2005 levels. In its existing target, India had promised to reduce its emissions intensity by 33% to 35% by the set deadline. Aarti Khosla, the director of Climate Trends, outlined that the commitment of 500GW of renewable energy by 2030, which is more than twice the installed capacity of coal currently, should set the stage for a quick transformation of the energy sector, “the kind of which hasn’t been witnessed so far.""  ""Ensuring that the new energy regime doesn’t bring the pitfalls of the current regime will be fundamental. Solar and wind are poised to emerge as the future in the net-zero world, Khosla added. ALSO READ | What we know about India’s net-zero emissions target Delivering a strong message to the world, Modi stressed India expected developed countries “to make $1 trillion available as climate finance as soon as possible”. “Today, as we track the progress on climate mitigation, the same way we must track climate finance,” the Prime Minister said. Ajay Mathur, the director-general of International Solar Alliance said Modi cut through the rhetoric and delivered a big promise of climate action from India. “Reducing 1billion tonnes of emissions by 2030 and expanding non-fossil capacity to 500 GW are enormous and transformative steps. 50% of electricity generation from renewable energy sources speaks to India's leadership and commitment to climate action. The Prime Minister has made bold announcements and led India from the front at the onset of the Glasgow meeting,” Mathur added. During his speech on India's 75th Independence Day this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also announced the country's plan to become a net-zero carbon emitter by 2050 and highlighted that work was underway for 100% electrification of Indian Railways. Feasibility of India's action India’s announcement of 500GW of non-fossil based electricity capacity by 2030 is in line with its domestic commitment for 450GW of renewable energy capacity by end of the decade. According to the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), projections for India’s total installed power generation capacity by 2029-30, India will have 817GW of installed capacity out of which 525GW can be met by non-fossil based electricity capacity.  By this estimate, the projection is reasonably high and achievable according to Modi’s announcements. This new target translates to two-thirds of India’s installed capacity in 2030 and sets an ambitious goal from the current Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) which accounted for 40% of non-fossil fuels in India’s energy mix. The expected electricity demand in 2030 is around 2,325 billion units (BUs) and out of this 1,150 BUs is expected to be met through renewable energy. The current electricity requirement in 2021-22 is 1566 BUs. The new 50% target of electricity generated by solar, wind and hydropower is more ambitious than what would be achieved solely through market factors and falling prices of renewable energy. Massive support and push from the policy level are required for carbon-free electricity standards, investments in ramping up storage capacity, improving the health of power distribution companies, grid stability, net metering, etc. An analysis by the Council for Energy Environment and Water (CEEW) show the enhanced NDC targets are compatible with the 2070 net-zero target. Vaibhav Chaturvedi, a fellow at Council for Energy Environment and Water (CEEW) said, “India's ambitious domestic 450 GW RE target has now been communicated as the 500 GW non-fossil electricity target at the international stage. It is certain that this target will bend the emissions curve, though it still would be rising for at least the next two decades due to a fast-growing economy."" “India intends to continue to do more than its fair share on climate action. At the global level, however, the collective net-zero targets might not be 1.5 degrees Celsius compatible. Science demands that cumulative global emissions between 2020 and 2100 are limited to 400-500 GtCO2. Given their net-zero targets, the cumulative emissions of China, the US and the European Union between 2020 and 2050 will together corner over 90% of global carbon space available for achieving the 1.5 degress Celsius target. The burden of action now lies on the developed world to prepone their net-zero pledges to ensure a 1.5 Deg compatible world.” Chaturvedi explained. Emissions intensity target commendable Despite being a developing nation with a large population base, India has showcased commendable leadership in augmenting the economy-wide carbon intensity reduction target from 33-35% to 45% by 2030.  As of 2016, India had already achieved an emission intensity to GDP of 23% (this estimate excludes the agriculture sector), as reported in the BUR-III submitted by India to the UNFCCC. The emissions intensity of the Indian economy has been steadily declining due to more renewable energy, improved energy efficiency, and structural shifts towards the services sector.  The new target does not give details but is consistent with the ongoing trend and with the other targets announced by the Prime Minister. Going from the earlier emissions intensity target of 33-35% to the new target of 45% translates to around 1 billion tonnes of emissions reduction. India is currently the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, releasing more than 3 billion tonnes every year. According to the World Resources Institute database, India’s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2018 was about 3.3 billion tonnes, up from 2.5 billion tonnes in 2010. At this rate, India’s projected emissions between now and 2030 could be in the range of 30-32 billion tonnes. With Modi's announcement to reduce 1 billion tonnes in cumulative emissions by 2030, it is the first time the country has given an absolute emission reduction target. Earlier, the closest reference to altering its emissions trajectory used to be in the form of emissions intensity. Under the international climate change framework, only developed countries are mandated, and expected, to make reductions in their absolute emissions. This translates to an economy-wide absolute emission reduction of 3% for the period of 2005 to 2030, which again for a developing country is very ambitious according to Vasudha Foundation. The Energy Policy Simulator for India estimates that India’s emissions could grow from 3.3 billion tonnes in 2021 to reach 4.6 billion tonnes in 2030 (excluding land use and forestry) based on current policy and actions in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and electric mobility, and cost-optimisation of technologies in the electricity and transport sectors. Pathway to net-zero Earlier this year, Union minister Piyush Goyal set an ambitious target of turning the Indian Railways into the world’s first net-zero carbon emitter by 2030. The minister had issued directives to railways to identify huge areas of unproductive land for setting up solar power plants to generate electricity for the national transporter. ALSO READ | By switching on the sun, Railways can prevent 7mn tonnes of carbon emissions India is counted as one of the progressive climate champions. Even though India’s historic contribution to the climate crisis is a fraction of what developed economies, India has always shouldered more than its fair share. By announcing net-zero by 2070, India continues to demonstrate its commitments towards addressing the climate crisis. “By announcing a commitment for achieving net-zero targets by 2070, India has responded positively to the global call and it was the best climate action in Glasgow today,” Aarti Khosla said. According to the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C, pathways with higher chances of holding warming to below 1.5°C generally show a faster decline in the carbon intensity of electricity by 2030 than pathways that temporarily overshoot 1.5°C. By 2050, the share of electricity supplied by renewables increase to 59–97% (minimum-maximum range) across 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot (High Confidence). As per IPCC’s estimates, the world must become a ‘net-zero’ carbon emitter by 2050 to meet the 1.5°C-goal, and to achieve this, total greenhouse gas emissions need to reach zero between 2063 and 2068."
" India’s carbon dioxide emissions are seen peaking between 2040 and 2045, before sliding downward, India’s environment secretary Rameshwar Prasad Gupta  told Bloomberg. The pace of the post-peak decline will depend on the availability of technologies in areas including energy, industry and agriculture, Gupta told Bloomberg Television at the United Nations COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. He cautioned that meeting the country’s climate targets will depend on the availability of financing. Prime Minister Narendra Modi surprised delegates at the conference earlier this week with the pledge that the world’s third-biggest emitter will reach net-zero by 2070. Gupta echoed Modi’s demand that the developed world needs to increase climate funding to support bigger targets to tackle global warming. On the country’s low-carbon strategy, Gupta said India has few easy options left. “Probably most of the low-hanging fruits we have already exhausted,” he said, adding, “Like renewable energy without storage. Our electricity system can probably no longer sustain any more renewables without storage.” The country has built more than 100 gigawatts of renewable power capacity and aims to more than quadruple that by the end of the decade. Yet, while accounting for about a quarter of the country’s installed capacity, renewables contribute just about 10% to the country’s power generation, with coal dominating the mix at nearly 70%."
" Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday played the drums with members of the Indian community who were dressed in traditional kurta pyjamas and turbans, gathered to bid goodbye before his departure from Glasgow, Scotland. PM Modi was in Glasgow for the United Nations' COP26 World Leaders' Summit on climate change. He came back to India on Wednesday morning. As he departed from the hotel he was staying in Glasgow, Scotland, the Prime Minister was greeted by members of the Indian community. PM Modi interacted with several children, shaked hands and even gave high-fives. He was also seen holding one cheerful toddler. At the airport, PM Modi was greeted by members of the Indian community who bid him farewell to the accompaniment of the beats of drums and loud cheering. Some even sought autograph of PM Modi.

At the COP26 Summit, the Prime Minister announced five ""amrit tatva"" including the target to attain net-zero emissions by 2070. He also said that India will increase its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW and meet 50 per cent of its energy requirements through renewable energy by 2030. COP26 is being held from October 31 to November 12 under the Presidency of the UK partnering with Italy. The high-level segment of COP26, titled the World Leaders' Summit (WLS), was held from November 1-2. Heads of state/government of more than 120 countries attended the summit. On Saturday and Sunday, PM Modi participated in the G20 summit in Rome. He also met outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Indonesian President Joko Widodo here on the sidelines of the G20."
              
" With climate change rapidly flipping traditional weather patterns around the world, global corn yields, among other staple produces, can be expected to sink by nearly a quarter or 24 per cent by 2030, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) said in a new study. At the same time, wheat yields have been projected to grow at 17 per cent. The study, published in the journal Nature Food, was a collaborative effort from groups, including NASA, as well as the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). Researchers found rising temperatures and shifts in rainfall and human-made greenhouse gas emissions, which have already begun to cause effects, will make it harder to grow corn and production cuts are occurring sooner than expected as compared to past studies, reported Bloomberg. Corn, like soybeans and rice, is a staple in global livestock rations in regions like the Americas, west Africa and China. The study revealed the production cuts are going to affect several other staple produce as well. However, the results for corn and wheat yields were clearer. Wheat yields, it said, could significantly climb till 2030 as warming weather expands suitable growing areas for the crop, including the northern United States, Canada, the plains of north China, central Asia, and others. However, these gains are likely to level off by mid-century. “Even under optimistic climate change scenarios, where societies enact ambitious efforts to limit global temperature rise, global agriculture is facing a new climate reality…And with the interconnectedness of the global food system, impacts in even one region’s breadbasket will be felt worldwide,” lead author Jonas Jaegermeyr said in a statement."
" Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said the world would have to make adaptation the main part of our development policies and schemes to fight climate change. Addressing a side event on ‘Action and Solidarity - The Critical Decade’, convened by his counterpart from United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, Modi said climate adaptation did not get as much importance as mitigation in the international climate debate and it was an injustice to vulnerable countries. Speaking about the need to include in the school syllabus the importance of living in harmony with nature as per traditional practices, Modi said just like in India, climate was a big challenge for agriculture sector for most developing countries. From sources of drinking water to affordable housing, all need to be made resilient against climate change, he added. Addressing the event in Hindi, Modi said, ""Many traditional communities have the knowledge of living in harmony with nature. In our adaptation policies, the traditional practices should be given importance. To ensure this knowledge reaches the next generation, it should be added to the school syllabus.”  “Climate is a huge challenge for the farmers of developing nations including India. Cropping pattern is changing, untimely rains, floods and continuous storms are destroying crops,” he added. He said in India policies like tap water for all, Clean India Mission and clean cooking fuel for all have given adaptation benefits to the needy as well as improved their quality of life. “We have to make adaptation the main part of our development policies and schemes. In India, schemes like 'Nal Se Jal', Clean India Mission and Ujjawala have not only given adaptation benefits to our citizens but also improved their quality of life,” the PM said in Hindi. Modi is among more than 120 heads of states and governments who have reached Glasgow for the two-day summit at the start of the UN's COP26 conference, which organisers say is crucial for charting humanity's path away from catastrophic global warming. Earlier in the day, the PM took to Twitter stating that he would elaborate on India’s vision and efforts to overcome climate change during his summit address. (With inputs from agencies)"
" Climate activists, environmentalists, world leaders and policymakers from around 200 countries are meeting in Glasgow, Scotland to take part in United Nations' climate summit, the 26th Conference of Parties (COP26), to broker a deal to save the planet from impending ecological disaster. Being held between October 31 and November 12, COP26 is seen as the biggest climate conference since Paris summit (COP21) in 2015, and is seen as crucial in setting worldwide emission targets to slow global warming, as well as firming up other key commitments. The meeting will see negotiators from the participating countries try to deliberate on issues left hanging since the 2015 Paris climate accord was forged, and find ways to ratchet up their efforts to keep global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) this century compared with pre-industrial times. Climate experts cautioned that the chances of meeting the goal, agreed in Paris six years ago, are slowly slipping away. The planet has already warmed by more than 1.1 degrees Celsius and current projections are for it to hit 2.7 degrees Celsius by the year 2100. For a developing country like India, COP26 will be an opportunity to review the implementation of the 2030 Roadmap for stronger India-UK strategic partnership.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to deliver India's national statement on climate action at the COP26 plenary. India will focus on its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) target for the post-2020 period under the 2015 Paris Agreement.  Some of India's goals include a reduction in emissions intensity of its GDP by 33% to 35% by 2030 from 2005 level, as well as achieving 40% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030. However, India refused the calls to announce a net-zero carbon emissions target and urged the wealthier nations to transfer technology and finance required to help developing and least-developed countries to adapt to the effects of climate change. "
" International climate and environment watchdog Greenpeace International on Sunday demanded a faster and more ambitious action plan in response to the climate emergency and coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, saying the G20 summit in Rome failed to confront the global crisis. Greenpeace International executive director Jennifer Morgan said that the G20 summit's message was “weak” and “lacked ambition” and vision. “If the G20 was a dress rehearsal for COP26, then world leaders fluffed their lines. Their communique was weak, lacking both ambition and vision, and simply failed to meet the moment,” Morgan was quoted as saying by news agency PTI in a release. ""Now they move onto Glasgow where there is still a chance to seize a historic opportunity, but the likes of Australia and Saudi Arabia need to be marginalised, while rich countries need to finally grasp that the key to unlock COP26 is trust,"" Morgan further said. The remarks came as United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC) 26th climate conference, or COP 26 as it is better known as, began on Sunday and will go on till November 12 at Glasgow, Scotland where more than 180 countries are participating. Morgan said that activists from around the world are in Glasgow, demanding the missing action to protect everyone from both the climate crisis and the coronavirus pandemic. ""Governments must respond to the deadly warnings the planet is giving us and cut emissions drastically right now, to stay in line with 1.5 degree Celsius, and that requires stopping any new fossil fuel development and phase them out. ""At COP26, we will not let up and continue to push for more climate ambition, as well as the rules and actions to back it up. We need to stop all new fossil fuel projects immediately,"" he said. Meanwhile, Greenpeace India's executive director Binu Jacob called for tough decisions on the part of India to address climate change. “South Asia, including India, is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change. The latest IPCC report is suggestive that India might experience more frequent extreme weather events. It is an undeniable fact that anthropogenic emissions have direct correlation with climate,” Jacob said. ""India has to take tough decisions to address climate issues at the same time, it is the need for the developed countries to step up and take more responsibilities that help developing countries in climate adaptation and mitigation,"" Jacob was quoted as saying by PTI. Jacob stressed rich and developed countries have been historically responsible for emissions and they need to change their business and lifestyles that impact climate change. ""The vulnerable countries and regions cannot afford to pay the price for the impact of climate change for the historical wrongs done,"" Jacob said. Giuseppe Onufrio, the executive director of Greenpeace Italy, too, called for boost in renewables and cutting carbon emissions by Rome, saying the Italian Prime Minister has urged G20 nations to up their ambition to honour a 1.5 degree Celsius pathway, ""but we are calling on him to lead by example."" ""As COP co-presidency, Italy must deliver ambitious climate targets that cut emissions at their source as quickly as possible and present a new ambitious plan which must not rely on false solutions such as carbon offsetting, cut greenhouse gases emissions and boost renewables,"" Onufrio said. He further said that emissions from G20 nations account for around 76% of global annual emissions and as of July 2021, only around half those emissions were covered by enhanced pledges to cut them in line with the Paris Agreement. ""Large emitters amongst G20 nations including Australia and India have yet to submit new NDCs. At COP26, which starts today in Glasgow, Greenpeace is calling on governments to urgently step up their climate ambition, starting with a phase-out of fossil fuels, and show solidarity with the countries which are the most vulnerable to the climate crisis,"" he said. In a similar view, Morgan said that governments must reduce emissions at home and stop shifting that responsibility to more vulnerable communities, through carbon offsetting schemes that compromise their livelihoods. ""We are calling for true solidarity to support poorer countries to survive and adapt to the climate emergency. Every moment spent where wealthy governments focus on corporations' bottom lines, rather than enacting solutions, costs people's lives,' she said. Jacob added that COP26 is one of the important opportunities for world leaders to show their strong commitment to tackle the climate breakdown. “The world leaders must commit and act towards achieving the ambitious goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C. It is also pertinent to remember that most developed countries have not met their climate commitments or their responsibility towards the vulnerable countries,” Jacob said."
" Prime Minister Narendra Modi is all set to attend the second session of the G20 Rome Summit, which will be held on the subject of climate change and the environment on Sunday. PM Modi, who is currently in Rome at the invitation of his Italian counterpart Mario Draghi, will conclude his two-day trip to the country and will next be travelling to Glasgow in the United Kingdom to attend the 26th Conference of Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is also beginning on October 31, according to the official schedule. Also Read | India & Climate Change: Implications of setting a net zero target Prime Minister Modi attended the first session of the G20 Rome Summit on Saturday, where he discussed the global economy and health along with a host of world leaders.

Among the topics highlighted by PM Modi at the G20 summit are India's contributions in the global fight against Covid-19, the vision of ‘One Earth, One Health’, furthering innovation in healthcare, the need for resilient global supply chains, and leveraging technology for human empowerment. The second session of the G20 summit on Sunday, focusing on climate and the environment, is being seen as an important stepping stone to the UN's COP26 climate summit attended by almost 200 countries, in Glasgow, Scotland, where most of the G20 leaders will fly directly from Rome. Also Read | Climate finance, carbon markets to top India’s agenda at COP26 The G20 bloc, which includes Brazil, China, India, Germany, and the United States, accounts for an estimated 80 per cent of the global greenhouse gas emissions which scientists say must be steeply reduced to avoid climate catastrophe. Notably, India is the world’s third-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the United States, and PM Modi’s participation in the COP26 summit, which runs from October 31 to November 12, is seen as critical."

" World leaders attending the G20 Summit at the end of October and the CoP 26 shortly thereafter, will grapple with the problem of combating climate change. Reports suggest that the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change favours continuing with the traditional position of not committing to reduce emissions. In a paper titled “Getting to Net Zero: An Approach for India at CoP-26”, prepared for the Centre for Social and Economic Progress, Montek Singh Ahluwalia and Utkarsh Patel, suggest a different approach. The urgency of action to combat climate change has been amply brought out by the IPCC’s assessment that unless greenhouse gas emissions are sharply reduced, we are set for a +3°C warming by the end of the century. This would be disastrous for the world and also for India. There is much talk of getting countries to commit to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and many developing countries are now willing to commit to such an objective. While net-zero is an attractive slogan, that has effectively captured the imagination in industrialised countries, we have argued in this paper that it is not necessarily the best way of structuring a global agreement on climate change mitigation. Why 2050 as a Net Zero Date is not the right target The science behind 2050 as the net zero date is derived from the IPCC’s assessment that if the global temperature rise by the end of the century is to be limited to +1.5°C, then the remaining carbon space for additional emissions in the world is limited and global CO2 emissions must start to decline sharply reaching net zero by around 2050. This conclusion, though valid for the world as a whole, does not imply that all countries must necessarily get to net zero at the same time. Ideally, the remaining carbon budget should be apportioned across countries in a manner that is deemed to be fair, reflecting the concept of “climate justice” that is built into the UNFCCC by way of “respective capabilities”. If such fair carbon budgets could be defined for each country, the correct mitigation strategy would be to ensure that every country adopts an emissions trajectory that keeps its cumulative emissions within its respective carbon budget. In that case, the date when a country reaches net zero would not matter. As a practical matter, it is unlikely that the CoP-26 can agree on what is a fair share of the remaining carbon space for each country. The climate change negotiations are therefore likely to continue on the basis of voluntary commitments as happened in the Paris Agreement. Individual countries will offer enhanced INDCs and India could also easily do the same. However, they may also offer commitments to reach net zero by a certain date and the question arises how India should respond. In our view, a net zero date by itself is not very meaningful without a specified trajectory for getting there. A convex trajectory that gets to net zero in 2050 would generate much more emissions than a concave trajectory with the same net zero date. In any case, even though it is accepted that 2050 is an average date for the world as a whole, there is a good case for advanced countries to get to net zero well before 2050, allowing developing countries to get there later. This would be a concrete step towards climate justice. The right approach, therefore, is for each country to focus not on the net zero date but to indicate its emissions reduction trajectory consistent with its development imperatives. The IPCC could then be asked to compute the implications for the world as a whole of the combined trajectories. If the trajectories offered voluntarily imply an excessive level of global emissions, the issue can be considered at the next CoP meeting, with appropriate consideration of which countries should do more to reduce their emissions. Should India Offer an Emissions Reduction Trajectory? The above approach would represent a departure from the position we have traditionally taken that we cannot consider any reduction in emissions because our development objectives include a substantial growth in GDP, which in turn needs to be supported by higher energy use entailing increased emissions. However, this argument no longer holds because technology now makes it possible to meet the energy needs of growth relying on renewables to meet all additional demand and also to gradually phase out current fossil fuel-based energy sources. We have argued that rapid growth can be reconciled with emissions reduction by adopting a strategy of electrifying as many sectors as possible and also shifting progressively to renewable sources of electricity, mainly solar and wind. The switch will not burden the economy with higher costs of electricity because the costs of renewable energy are falling, and the trend is expected to continue. However, the switch will involve many structural changes in the economy which have to be carefully planned and will also pose a substantial financing challenge. Many of the steps needed to achieve the transition envisaged are already underway. Full electrification of railway traction is likely to be achieved in the next few years. EVs are already being encouraged in private and public passenger transport and light commercial freight. The industry is also moving towards electricity for its energy needs, but there are certain areas such as steel, cement and fertiliser production where it is not easy to get rid of fossil fuels at present. Green hydrogen, however, has great promise in some of these areas. It is not yet cost-competitive, but costs are likely to fall. Chairman Reliance Industries has announced that they hope to bring the costs of green hydrogen down from s $5-6 per kg, at present to $1 by 2030.           "
" Australia, one of the world’s top per-capita polluters, finally agreed to a plan to zero out its carbon emissions by 2050. Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the target days before he is scheduled to head to Europe for G-20 talks and then the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. It follows a new round of fractious domestic debate on climate policy, an issue that’s riven Australia’s politics for more than a decade and comes after pressure from allies including the U.S. on Australia to show more urgency in action to limit global warming.  “We will set a target to achieve net-zero by 2050, and have a clear plan for achieving it,” Morrison said in an emailed statement Tuesday. “We won’t be lectured by others who do not understand Australia. The Australian Way is all about how you do it, and not if you do it. It’s about getting it done.” The government will stick with 2030 goals that have been criticized by activists and business leaders alike as too weak, adding to the sense that timid pledges from developed nations are stifling prospects for major progress at the climate talks. Morrison on Tuesday reiterated that Australia was on track to “meet and beat” its target and that he would provide an update on progress in Glasgow. Australia is one of the top suppliers of fossil fuels, and the sector accounts for almost a quarter of its export earnings. The nation is being looked at to help show leadership that’ll encourage developing countries to step up their efforts. Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil exporter, on Saturday pledged to a goal to hit net zero by 2060. Morrison has frequently ruled out taxes for polluters, and backed the country’s top emitters to devise the best solutions to help Australia hit net zero. His government also hasn’t ruled out subsidizing new coal-fired power stations, with the fuel still responsible for the bulk of the nation’s electricity generation. That’s a blow for COP President Alok Sharma, who has struggled to win momentum for his ambition to “consign coal to history.” Nations like Australia and China, which are lifting coal output to ease an energy crisis, have resisted calls to more quickly phase out their own consumption of fuel.  While every Australian state and territory -- and key trading partners China, Japan, and South Korea -- have committed to net-zero emissions, a national target is politically complicated for Morrison, who must hold elections by May and trails the main Labor opposition in opinion polls.  Lawmakers within the National Party, the junior member of Australia’s governing coalition, have raised concerns over the threat to rural jobs, particularly in coal-mining communities, from an energy transition and demanded a series of concessions in return for their support.

" According to research from Dartmouth College and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, climate change impacts on freshwater systems can lower nutrition and increase toxicity at the base of the food web. The findings of the study were published in the journal 'Scientific Reports'. The research focused on the effects of warming water temperatures and browning - a discolouration of water caused by increased dissolved organic matter - using controlled outdoor environments known as mesocosms. ""Climate change scenarios predict increases in temperature and organic matter supply from land to water. For the first time, we used manipulated mesocosm systems to test the effects of warming and browning,"" said Pianpian Wu, a postdoctoral fellow at Dartmouth and lead author of the study. Under the expected climate scenario of more warming, changing precipitation patterns, and higher levels of dissolved organic matter, the study looked at the fate of nutritious polyunsaturated fatty acids and toxic methylmercury in the food chain. The research found that a combination of warmer, browner water resulted in the higher transfer of methylmercury from water to phytoplankton at the base of the food web. Lower concentrations of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids in phytoplankton were also observed. ALSO READ | Study: Climate change threatens to spread viruses through an unprepared world Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids--such as omega-3 and omega-6--support the growth and survival of animal and plant life by providing energy and by regulating immune systems. Methylmercury is a form of mercury that is easily absorbed by living organisms and acts as a potent neurotoxin. ""The reduction of polyunsaturated acids at the end of the mesocosm experiment with both warming and browning effects was concerning,"" said Wu, who began the research as a PhD candidate at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. Phytoplankton are the main suppliers of polyunsaturated fatty acids in aquatic ecosystems. According to the study, the less nutritious phytoplankton that result from browning and warmer water cause higher-level organisms--such as zooplankton, fish, other wildlife, and humans--to be exposed to more methylmercury as they consume more to achieve fatty acid quotas. ""This study shows that the food quality at the base of aquatic food webs deteriorates with climate change. The research is important because it places food web investigations within the context of active global change processes,"" said Kevin Bishop, professor at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and the senior researcher of the study. While previous research on browning and warming has been conducted in natural environments, this is the only study to rely entirely on controlled mesocosm environments. The researchers used 24 thermally insulated plastic cylinders to test the effects of various levels of warming and browning under four different scenarios, including a reference scenario without any weathering effect. The mesocosms were controlled at subalpine conditions that are highly prone to climate change effects and relatively poor in dissolved organic matter. ""The use of mesocosms to investigate questions related to ecosystem effects of climate change is particularly important,"" said Celia Chen, research professor at Dartmouth and a co-author of the study.

" Leaders may be going into the UN climate summit in Glasgow with the do-or-die goal of limiting global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius, but breaching that cap is not what keeps scientists awake at night. The real disaster scenario begins with the triggering of invisible climate tripwires known as tipping points. ""Climate tipping points are a game-changing risk -- an existential threat -- and we need to do everything within our power to avoid them,"" said Tim Lenton, director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter. - What's a tipping point? - Anyone who has leaned back in a chair balancing on two legs knows there is a threshold beyond which you irrevocably crash to the floor. That portal between two stable states -- in this case, an upright versus a fallen-over chair -- is a tipping point, and Earth's complex, interlocking climate system is full of them. These temperature thresholds have potentially widespread impacts. If temperatures rise enough to melt the ice sheets atop Greenland and West Antarctica, it could lift oceans more than a dozen metres (40 feet). The Amazon tropical forest, upon which we depend to soak up carbon pollution, could turn into savannah. Or shallow subsoil known as permafrost -- mostly in Siberia -- tenuously holding twice the amount of greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere could see those harmful emissions seep into the air. ""We have seen a number of tipping points already in coral reefs and polar systems, and more are likely in the near term,"" the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said in a draft report on climate impacts, due out in February, obtained by AFP. In most cases, reversing the changes set in motion would be beyond the grasp of humanity for many generations, if not millennia. - Why so scary? - One of the first scientists to unlock the secret of tipping points recalled suddenly understanding some 15 years ago why they were so ominous. ""It was an 'Oh Shit!' moment,"" Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, founding director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), told AFP in an interview. ""Planetary machinery -- the monsoon system, ocean circulation, the jet stream, the big ecosystems -- abounds with non-linear systems,"" he said, referring to the potential for abrupt, dramatic change. ""That means you have so many points of no return."" In Antarctica, more than half the ice shelves that prevent glaciers -- some larger in area than England and Scotland combined -- from sliding into the ocean and lifting sea levels are at risk of crumbling due to climate change. ""It is like uncorking a bottle, and we are uncorking them one by one,"" said Schellnhuber. Earth-altering tipping points have different temperature thresholds. Scientists know these tripwires are there, but not exactly where they lie. Even more unsettling is how easily our already belaboured efforts to eliminate carbon pollution could be overwhelmed by the changes we are setting in motion. If thawing permafrost surrenders as much CO2 as humanity stops emitting, we find ourselves fighting a war on two fronts: on top of the struggle to slash our own emissions we'd have to cope with those generated by the planet itself. - How many are there? - Scientists count about 15 significant tipping points in the planet's climate system. Some are regional, others are global, all are interconnected. Those least resistant to global warming and closest to a point of no return are tropical coral reefs, the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, alpine glaciers, Arctic summer sea ice and the Amazon forest. Parts of the climate system more resistant to rising temperatures include the global currents that redistribute heat through the oceans, the Arctic jet stream, the Indian monsoon, El Ninos in the Pacific, and desertification in the Sahel. While permafrost probably doesn't have a single temperature tripwire, the IPCC estimates it will release tens of billions of tonnes of CO2 for every extra degree of global warming. The last holdout would be East Antarctica's ice sheet, which holds 56 metres worth of sea-level rise. - Why are we hearing about them now? - The IPCC's most recent mega-report is the first to give tipping points more than a cursory mention. ""Abrupt responses and tipping points of the climate system... cannot be ruled out,"" the UN's climate science advisory body now warns. While scientists have long been aware of the danger that tipping points pose, part of the problem has been the inability of climate models -- which are built to track gradual, linear change -- to anticipate the timing or impact of abrupt shocks. ""Just because tipping points are challenging to predict doesn't mean they can be ignored,"" Lenton said. - What is the ripple effect? - A new wave of research is focusing on how sudden shifts triggered by tipping points ripple across the climate system, leading to possible chain reactions. Accelerating melt-off from the Greenland ice sheet, for example, is almost certainly slowing down the conveyor belt of ocean currents known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). This, in turn, could push Earth's tropical rain belt southward and weaken the African and Asian monsoons, upon which hundreds of millions depend for rain-fed crops. Scientists cannot rule out the possibility that the AMOC will stall altogether, as it has in the past. If this happened, European winters would become much harsher and sea levels in the North Atlantic basin could rise substantially. There are dozens of other ways in which facets of the climate system are intertwined. - What is a 'hothouse Earth'? - Earth's past tells us that continuing greenhouse gas emissions ""could tip the global climate into a permanent hot state,"" according to the recent IPCC report.

" Climate change is creating ideal conditions for infectious-disease transmission and the world’s health-care systems aren’t ready for the shock it will cause, according to a new study. After nations largely failed the stress test of Covid-19, a novel virus, decades of progress to control age-old illnesses such as malaria, dengue fever and cholera are under threat unless leaders commit to more ambitious climate plans, the Lancet said in a study Wednesday. The medical journal’s sixth annual report, named The Lancet Countdown, tracks 44 indicators of health impacts that are directly linked to climate change and highlights worsening social inequalities.  Drawing on research from 38 academic institutions and United Nations agencies, the study by the British medical journal found that the potential for viral outbreaks is increasing most rapidly in developed countries. The danger of malaria infections is rising in cooler areas, while coasts around northern Europe and the U.S. are becoming more prone to bacteria which produce gastroenteritis and sepsis. Meanwhile, almost 600 million people are living less than 5 meters (16 feet) above sea level, which puts them at risk of increased flooding and intense storms. Many could be forced to permanently leave their homes, according to the report. “These are grim warnings that for every day that we delay our response to climate change, the situation gets more critical,” warned Maria Romanello, a research director and lead author of the report. “It’s time to realize that no one is safe from the effects of climate change.”  Fewer than half of the 91 countries tracked in the study have a national health and climate change plan, leaving their medical sectors vulnerable to climate-induced shocks, the report said. Of the 45 nations with a strategy, only eight had allocated funds to tackle the issues raised in their assessments. Covid-19 has caused almost 5 million deaths around the world and pushed economies to the brink. As countries loosen lockdowns in an effort to reboot their economies, many are struggling to control a resurgence in infections, worsened by an unequal distribution of vaccines between developed countries and lower-income nations. The study found similar inequalities in the global response to climate change, with underdeveloped countries that are least responsible for rising emissions lagging in efforts to decarbonize. These nations will be hit the hardest by global warming as droughts threaten food and water security, an issue that affected 2 billion people in 2019, the report warned. The biggest barrier to delivering resources was insufficient financing, according to 69% of the surveyed countries. But with nations injecting trillions of dollars to restart their economies in the midst of the pandemic, the report urged policymakers to “move beyond rhetoric and take action” at a UN conference in Glasgow that starts at the end of the month, where world leaders, executives and climate activists will hammer out plans to cut carbon emissions. The study also warned against a fossil fuel-driven economic recovery that funds oil, gas and coal production, but gives limited support for clean energy. Instead, nations should create green jobs and safeguard health, the report said. “Climate change is here and we’re already seeing it damaging human health across the world,” said Anthony Costello, executive director of the Lancet Countdown. “The recovery from Covid-19 can be a green recovery that puts us on the path of improving human health and reducing inequalities, or it can be a business-as-usual recovery that puts us all at risk.”"
" A key UN summit tasked with protecting biodiversity officially opened in China on Monday, as countries meet to tackle pollution and prevent mass extinction weeks before the COP26 climate conference. This year's COP15 gathering, hosted in the southwest city of Kunming, was originally set for 2020 and postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Around one million animal and plant species are threatened with extinction amid human encroachment on habitats, over-exploitation, pollution, the spread of invasive species, and climate change. Of them, some are critically endangered. They face various threats, from hunting to climate change. Here is a list of some of these lesser-known species: Large-antlered Muntjac: It is badly threated from very high hunting pressures. It is found in Annamite mountain range, in Laos, Vietnam and extending upto Cambodia. Cuban Crocodile: This medium-sized crocodile that lurks in inundated shrublands to prey on native rodents and turtles, is itself threatened by hunting. It is found infreshwater wetlands in Cuba. Pygmy Hog: This is the smallest of the wild suid group of species, which also include wild board and warthogs. It is down to a population of 100-250. The Pygmy Hog is found in India, possibly in Bhutan too. Egyptian Vulture: This species in an adaptable forager and also scavenges at human settlements. Yet, its population continues to decline. This vulture is found in Central and North Africa, the Middle East, India and the Mediterranean region. Iberian Lynx: This critically endangered species breeds only in the Mediterranean shrublands and relies on the endangered European Rabbit for 80-90% diet. The Iberian Lynx is found in Spain."
" The finance ministers of G20 (Group of 20) nations are all set to meet on Wednesday in the capital city of the United States, Washington DC, to discuss matters related to the international economy and global health, specifically focusing on efforts geared towards the promotion of more sustainable growth. The ministers will be joined by central bank governors as part of the meeting known as the annual G20 finance ministers and central bank governors (FMCBGs) meet. According to an official statement issued by G20, the Wednesday meeting will be held as part of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)-World Bank Group (WBG) annual meetings. In the third FMCBG meet held in Venice three months ago (the first such in-person finance track meeting since February 2020 owing to the Covid-19 pandemic), the ministers and the governors discussed international taxation matters and financial sector issues. In the fourth FMCBG meeting, the G20 ministers and the central bank governors are slated to discuss the Covid-19 global recovery, thanks to the vaccines against the coronavirus disease, but with a special focus on how recuperation still remains uneven across and even within several countries. According to the agenda of the meeting issued beforehand, the ministers and governors will exchange views on how to continue to sustain the economic recovery and address the adverse consequences of the pandemic, especially on the most impacted groups of the society. This takes special significance since the last FMCBG meeting had seen the ministers and governors have a “very fruitful exchange of views” on the support to the most vulnerable countries. To help countries in critical conditions, the meet is expected to discuss ways to channel a share of the special drawing rights (SDRs) of the $650 billion allocated by the IMF for this purpose. “Exchange of views will also continue on the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) and the International Development Association replenishment,” the G20 statement added."
" India is at the forefront of making serious efforts towards achieving climate change targets, said Dr Shailja Vaidya Gupta, former senior adviser at the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government, Adviser Department of Biotechnology and added that though the country's solar programme has been successful there is a need to set up manufacturing units of solar panels and reduce the dependency on China. ""India has been one of the major countries that have really made very serious efforts to meet the emission target it has proposed. We are successfully moving to alternate resources other than fossil fuels. Our solar programme has been successful. Now, it is challenged by the fact that there is a need to manufacture solar panels/cells in the country and reduce our dependence on solar imports especially from China"" said Dr Gupta in an interview with ANI. Speaking about the need to ramp up the manufacturing of solar panels and cells, she stated that China recently increased, opportunistically, its prices of solar panels and cells. At the same time, she highlighted that the goals of the country towards net zero carbon emissions are practical and achievable. ""The efforts of the government over a period of time have been effective in finding alternatives to fossil fuel. We will be meeting net-zero carbon emission,"" she said. Ahead of the Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26), India is on track to achieve the goals of renewable energy enshrined in the Paris Agreement and it has been well noted by other countries. Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the 21st session of United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP-21) in Paris in 2015 had announced an International Solar Alliance (ISA) to dedicate efforts for the promotion of solar energy. ISA is an alliance of over 120 countries initiated by India, most of them being sunshine countries which lie either completely or partly between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. Noting some developments towards switching to electric vehicles, Dr Gupta said that the market is booming and there has been a positive change in the direction with the help of the government and market forces. Speaking about the establishment of charging ports for electric vehicles she said, ""The charging ports will come up when there is a commercial pull for it. They are bound to come up even in small towns and villages."" This will support short distance city commute. Recently, the world's highest electric vehicle charging station was inaugurated in Kaza of Lahaul and Spiti district in Himachal Pradesh which reiterates India's efforts towards promoting electric vehicles. As several countries gear up to uphold climate change commitments, she said that it is important for developed nations to take responsibility for the impact that they create on the environment. ""The developed world has set standards for a consumptive lifestyle, using most of the world's natural resources. However, this needs to change. They need to change their lifestyle and consumptive patterns. They use more than they need,"" said Dr Gupta. She added that the other nations are being depleted of their resources as the developed nations continue to live a ""consumptive"" life. ""Even something as simple as disposable tissue paper, there are so many resources that have gone into it. There's water, energy, transportation, and a whole lot of natural resources,"" she said."
" India displayed a stern stance regarding climate change at the United Nations on Friday, pointing out that a “large gap” still exists in the commitment made by developed nations to provide developing countries with $100 billion for climate action. “This amount is less than what NFL (National Football League; the professional American football tournament) earns on media right,” said TS Tirumurti, India's permanent representative to the UN, while speaking on climate action at the ongoing 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA76). Also Read | Denmark PM to meet PM Modi on climate change ahead of COP 26 Long-term finance was a key pillar of the Paris Agreement (Paris Climate Accords), which recognised that it is crucial for developed nations to contribute to global efforts to tackle the climate crisis in order to aid developing nations to catch up with the efforts. However, even though this pledge of financial support—to mobilise $100 billion annually in climate finance to support the needs of developing countries—was made in 2010, much of it has still not been met. In fact, the UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa also personally urged the developed countries earlier this year in June to make good on their promise, according to an official statement by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Recognising that there is a need to desist from “cherry-picking” of the UNFCCC's structure, India's permanent representative to the UN, Tirumurti, said that the negotiation should be done by all the member-states and not just a few nations who tend to decide for all. “There is a need to desist from ‘cherry-picking’ from the inclusive and comprehensive structure of the UNFCCC,” the ANI news agency quoted Tirumurti as saying. “It is negotiated by all the member-states. A few should not decide for all. India supports member-states driven process in the interest of developing countries.” Need to desist from “cherry-picking” from inclusive & comprehensive structure of UNFCCC, it's negotiated by all member-states.

India supports member-states driven process in interest of developing countries: India's Permanent Rep to UN on Climate pic.twitter.com/jlvlOCtdzD According to Patricia Espinosa, who was speaking at the UN climate talks earlier this year, nations are still “talking about this promise” even though the need for climate action becomes more desperate with each passing day. Also Read | ‘The way net zero target is being formulated is unfair’ “We are still talking about this promise, despite greenhouse gas emissions continuing to be at their highest concentration ever; while extreme weather continues to decimate more parts of the world and with greater intensity; and while vulnerable people continue to suffer, continue to lose their livelihoods and their lives,” said the UN climate change executive secretary. The trillions of dollars being spent by developed nations for recovery from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) shows that $100 billion annually could be mobilised “relatively easily with the adequate political will”, according to the UN. For many nations, securing the financing necessary to spur their own transition to a more sustainable future can’t happen without this promised support. This includes action to cut greenhouse gas emissions and action to build resilience to the inevitable impacts of climate change, such as frequent and severe droughts, floods, and storms."
" Global warming has killed 14% of the world’s coral reefs in a decade and more will be wiped out if oceans keep rising in temperature, a study released on Tuesday has revealed. According to a report by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network (GCRMN), coral reefs equaling about 11,700 square kilometers — which is 2.5 times the size of Grand Canyon National Park — were lost between 2009 and 2018. ""Climate change is the biggest threat to the world's reefs,"" co-author Paul Hardisty, CEO of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said in a statement shared by the UN. ""There are clearly unsettling trends toward coral loss, and we can expect these to continue as warming persists,"" he added. The report by the United Nations-supported global data network is the largest ever survey of coral health and covers data for 40 years, among 73 countries and 12,000 locations. The study also identifies dynamite fishing and pollution, but it is global warming that is seen as the primary reason behind the loss of coral reefs, which has left swathes of bleached skeletons in place of vibrant ecosystems. Coral bleaching accounts for much of the loss Corals in South Asia, Australia, the Pacific, East Asia, the Western Indian Ocean, the Gulf, and the Gulf of Oman, were among the hardest hit. Much of the loss was attributed to coral bleaching, as per the report. Coral bleaching is a phenomenon that takes place when corals — under stress from warmer water— expel the colorful algae that live inside their tissues, turning them white. Data in the study showed that such a bleaching event in 1998 alone was responsible for the loss of 8 per cent of the world’s corals. “Since 2009 we have lost more coral worldwide than all the living coral in Australia,” UNEP executive director Inger Anderson said. “We can reverse the losses, but we have to act now.” Some reefs ‘bounce back’ During the study, scientists also found that there was about a 2% regain among coral reefs in 2019, indicating they can be resilient when given respite from the facets working against them. ""Some reefs have shown a remarkable ability to bounce back, which offers some hope for the future recovery of degraded reefs,"" Hardisty said. Coral reefs cover just under 1% of the ocean floor but support more than 25% of marine life."
" Climate change protesters on Friday temporarily disrupted an access road close to Heathrow Airport, Britain's biggest travel hub, before police cleared the protest and arrested 13 people. More than a dozen activists from environmental group Insulate Britain sat in a row blocking the road during early morning rush hour. Some had glued their hands to the ground and chained themselves together using bicycle locks. Their protest brought traffic at a roundabout near the M4 motorway's Junction 3 to a standstill. Police eventually cleared the road, dragging handcuffed activists away from the site. ""Officers arrested 13 people for obstruction and conspiracy to commit public nuisance,"" London's Metropolitan Police said on its Twitter account. Insulate Britain wants the government to commit to providing insulation for 29 million homes in an effort to curb fossil fuel use and fight global warming. The group said on Friday that it also blocked a roundabout near the M1 motorway at Junction 1, its latest action after it stopped traffic on London's M25 orbital motorway multiple times over the last three weeks, and blocked the Port of Dover. In an attempt to stop the disruption, the transport ministry has sought injunctions from the High Court which mean that the protesters may face jail time for repeating their actions. But Insulate Britain says its actions will continue until Britain makes a meaningful statement to insulate the country's homes, which it says are the most energy inefficient in Europe."
                           
" The Canadian Journalism Foundation (CJF) and the World Editors Forum (WEF) is celebrating this year’s World News Day highlighting the role media plays in addressing the effects of climate change. “World News Day 2021 will serve as an important means of driving public conversation about the climate emergency and its impact, and draw attention to the importance of global fact-based journalism in reporting on this critical issue,’’ the World News Day’s website said. The programme will be hosted by Hollywood actor Victor Garber and news host of Global News, Farrah Nasser. Nasser is known for her coverage of experiences of marginalized peoples through two digital series - #FirstTimeIWasCalled and #LivingInColour. Garber is known for his role in Hollywood film Argo and is a recipient of the number of Emmy and Tony nominations for his acting in TV series, cinema as well as theatre. ‘World News Day: The Climate Crisis’ will discuss how the media plays an important role in addressing climate change by spreading awareness, informing the public and covering news which are related to climate emergencies. The programme will showcase flooding and wildfires reportage by renowned media organisations as well from youth activists. Journalism from Al Jazeera English, BBC, CBC News, Deutsche Welle, Global News, the Guardian, The New Yorker, Reuters, The Sacramento Bee, The Straits Times, South China Morning Post, Thomson Reuters Foundation and Univision will be featured. It will also highlight the regional climate change issues, activism and solutions from across the globe."
" Greta Thunberg and fellow youth campaigners struck a sceptical tone for this week's climate talks in Italy, saying much has been promised but little done to tackle global warming in almost three decades since the landmark Earth Summit. Fears that climate change is worsening grew after a U.N. report in August warned the situation was dangerously close to spiralling out of control, with the world certain to face further disruptions for generations to come. ""Thirty years of blah, blah, blah,"" Thunberg told the opening session of a Youth4Climate event on Tuesday. Thousands of young activists have converged on Milan this week with some 400, from about 190 countries, due to engage with policymakers to hammer out proposals for possible solutions. ""So-called leaders have cherry picked young people to meetings like this to pretend they are listening to us, but they are not listening,"" Thunberg said. ""There is no planet B ... Change is not only possible but necessary, but not if we go on like we have until today."" The youth activists, who fought to get climate change to the top of the global agenda years after leaders at the 1992 Rio Summit in Brazil pledged to tackle environmental problems, are being challenged to help come up with the solutions ahead of the COP26 United Nations summit in November. Their proposals will be vetted by climate and energy ministers gathering at the same venue for their pre-COP26 meeting, and some will find their way to the Glasgow summit. The meetings come as soaring energy prices on world markets stoke fears of a popular backlash against climate reform. The U.N. COP26 conference aims to secure more ambitious climate action from the nearly 200 countries who signed the 2015 Paris Agreement and agreed to try to limit human-caused global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. ""Young people need to start getting involved in the actual negotiations,"" said Rose Kobusinge, a youth delegate from Uganda. ""We want 1.5 (degrees) and we won’t go beyond that."" At their pre-COP26 summit, which starts on Thursday, some 50 climate ministers will tackle hurdles, including differing views on the pace of transition and who pays for it. While new energy and funding pledges from the U.S. and China have left negotiators more upbeat, many G20 countries, including major polluters like China and India, are yet to deliver updates of their short-term climate action plans. ""Now is the time for leaders of the biggest economies and the biggest greenhouse gas emitters to make much bolder commitments,"" Britain's COP26 President Alok Sharma, said in a video message on Tuesday. Climate activists are demanding policymakers match rhetoric with action and stump up the billions of dollars needed to wean the world off fossil fuels to cleaner energy during a year that has seen record-breaking heatwaves, floods and fires. ""Money speaks, and if rich nations don't restructure debt for poor nations and commit $500 billion for climate action from 2020-2024, there's no point in wasting time at these meetings,"" Oscar Soria of the U.S.-based activist network Avaaz said. Wealthy nations who pledged a decade ago to mobilize $100 billion a year to help vulnerable countries adapt and transition to cleaner energy are still short of their 2020 goal."
" Stating that climate change is a big challenge for agriculture and the entire ecosystem, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday stressed the need to step up efforts to fight it as he launched 35 crop varieties that are climate-resilient and have high nutrition content. During a virtual ceremony, Modi also inaugurated the newly constructed campus of the National Institute of Biotic Stress Tolerance, Raipur, Chhattisgarh. He also distributed the 'Green Campus Award' to agricultural universities and interacted with farmers who use innovative methods, before addressing a gathering. Modi said, ""Not only agriculture, but climate change is also a big challenge to the entire ecosystem. ...Due to climate change, new types of pests, new diseases, epidemics are coming. Due to this, there is a big threat to the health of humans, and livestock and crops are also being affected.” Climate change impact is on fish production and animal health and output. As a result, farmers and fishermen have to bear the losses, he said. ""Intensive research on these aspects is necessary continuously. When science, government, and society work together, the results will be better,"" he added. Modi interacted with farmers from different states, including two women farmers -- Zaitan Begum from Ganderabal district, Jammu and Kashmir, and Darshana Pedenkar from Bardez, Goa. He also interacted with Suresh Rana from Udham Singh Nagar, Uttarakhand, and Thoiba Singh from Thouba, Manipur. These farmers shared how they benefited from different government schemes like PM-KISAN. They also shared how they adopted new farm and processing techniques even in different terrains of Uttarakhand."
" Researchers have found that today's children will be hit much harder by climate extremes than today's adults. The findings of the study were published in the journal 'Science'. During their lifetime, a child born in 2021 will experience on average twice as many wildfires, between two and three times more droughts, almost three times more river floods and crop failures, and seven times more heatwaves compared to a person who's for instance 60 years old today, the researchers found based on data from the Inter-sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP). This is under a scenario of current greenhouse gas emission reduction pledges by governments which will be a topic at the upcoming world climate summit COP26 in Glasgow. ""Our results highlight a severe threat to the safety of young generations and call for drastic emission reductions to safeguard their future,"" said lead-author Wim Thiery from Vrije Universiteit Brussel. ""We even have strong reasons to think that our calculations underestimate the actual increases that young people will face,"" added Thiery. Regarding droughts, heatwaves, river floods and crop failures, people under the age of 40 today will live what the researchers call ""an unprecedented life"". ""The good news: we can indeed take much of the climate burden from our childrens' shoulders if we limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by phasing out fossil fuel use,"" said Katja Frieler, who is coordinating ISIMIP, she's a leading scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and co-author of the study. ""If we increase climate protection from current emission reduction pledges and get in line with a 1.5-degree target, we will reduce young people's potential exposure to extreme events on average by 24 per cent globally,"" explained Frieler. ""For North America, it's minus 26 per cent, for Europe and Central Asia minus 28 per cent, and in the Middle East and North Africa even minus 39 per cent. This is a huge opportunity,"" added Frieler. For instance, under a scenario of current insufficient climate policies, dangerous heatwaves that affect 15 per cent of the global land area today could increase to 46 per cent, hence triple by the end of the century.

" Boris Johnson, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, told world leaders on Wednesday night that humanity must “grow up” and learn to deal with climate change. In his impassioned speech, the British premier compared the collective conscience of humans to an impetuous 16-year-old – a teenager on a bender – and said that it is high time that we stopped trashing the planet. “My friends, the adolescence of humanity is coming to an end,” Johnson addressed world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York. “We must come together in a collective coming of age.” Boris Johnson's UNGA speech comes ahead of a major United Nations climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, which he is set to host in six weeks' time. The Wednesday address is meant to be preparation for Johnson's demands to press governments for tougher emissions, cutting targets, and more money to help poor countries clean up their economies. “If we keep on the current track then the temperatures will go up by 2.7 degrees or more by the end of the century,” he said. “And never mind what that will do to the ice floes.” Johnson said that we will see desertification, drought, crop failure, and mass movements of humanity on a scale not seen before. “Not because of some unforeseen natural event or disaster, but because of us, because of what we are doing now,” he said. The British prime minister said that humanity is behaving like an impetuous 16-year-old, “just old enough to get ourselves into serious trouble”. “We have come to that fateful age when we know roughly how to drive and we know how to unlock the drinks cabinet and to engage in all sorts of activity that is not only potentially embarrassing but also terminal,” Johnson said, adding that human beings “trash” the environment again and again with the inductive reasoning that we will somehow be getting away with it since we have got by so far. In positive developments with regards to climate change this week, two of the world's biggest economies – China and the United States – have vowed to cut back on carbon and increase funding on climate-conscious projects. While China's president Xi Jinping said that his country will no longer fund coal-fired power plants abroad, US president Joe Biden announced a plan to double financial aid for green growth to poorer nations to $11.4 billion by 2024. The United Kingdom, for its part, has vowed to reduce carbon emissions to net-zero by 2050, and Johnson has championed the expansion of renewable energy, saying the UK could become the “Saudi Arabia of wind.”"
" US President Joe Biden said on Tuesday that his country would increase its support to climate finance from $5.7 billion to $11.2 billion by 2024 to help low-income countries adapt to climate change and shift to cleaner energy. Addressing the opening plenary of the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly, for the first time since assuming the presidency of the US, Joe Biden called on the world leaders to join forces “to build a better future” and to address joint challenges such as climate change. Biden said his administration would work with US Congress to double the pledge of $5.7 billion in climate fund, taken in April this year, and make the country a “leader in international climate finance.” Biden opened his speech at the UN General Assembly by appealing to the world leaders to address the threats of climate change and health hazards. “Instead of continuing to fight the wars of the past, we are fixing our eyes and devoting our resources to the challenges that hold the keys to our collective future,” Biden said. The US President described climate change and the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic as “urgent and looming crises wherein lie enormous opportunities,” if the globe can “work together to seize” them. Over the past decade, the United States has been a laggard when it comes to climate finance. Former US President Barack Obama pledged $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund, the United Nation’s flagship climate finance initiative, but delivered just $1 billion before leaving office, according to a report by Climate Home. However, his successor Donald Trump went back on that pledge and in 2017-18 the US delivered less climate finance than France, Germany, Japan or the United Kingdom despite having an economy larger than all of them combined. In his speech on Tuesday, Biden said that the world was approaching a “point of no return” and reeling from “widespread death and devastation from the borderless climate crisis”. He urged all nations to bring their “highest possible ambitions to the table” when leaders meet at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow in November. COP26 president Alok Sharma took to Twitter to hail Biden’s announcement. Strongly welcome @POTUS further doubling 🇺🇸climate finance commitment to over $11bn by 2024

This demonstrate the increased ambition required to deliver on the $100bn/year goal

We must build on this momentum#UNGA #COP26"
" India’s nationally determined contribution (NDC), which was rated as 2 degrees compatible or “almost sufficient” by the Climate Action Tracker until last month, has now rated India as “highly insufficient” in its action and policies on climate change. This is because Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific analysis that tracks government climate action and measures it against Paris Agreement goals, has updated its rating system on Wednesday. Only Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Morocco, Nepal and United Kingdom have been rated as “almost sufficient” and only Gambia is “sufficient” or 1.5 degree compatible. USA, which used to be rated as “critically insufficient”, is now “insufficient” as per the new rating system, after incorporating US President Joe Biden administration’s new climate policies. Describing CAT’s new rating system, its website states that according to many fair share assessments, it would be considered fair that some countries continue emitting at high levels. “We are now in a situation where these countries can no longer follow a high emissions path, but other, richer countries do need to help them to rapidly decarbonise. We’ve also seen that it’s not only targets that matter, but the policies that governments put in place to meet those targets. The CAT not only evaluates government targets, but we also provide an estimate of countries’ emissions given implemented action,” adding that the new rating system takes a more granular look at domestic policies of countries. Under India’s current targets and policies, emissions will continue to rise and are consistent with 4 degree C or more of warming shows a modelled domestic emissions pathway according to CAT. India’s NDC has three main elements--an economy-wide emissions intensity target of 33%–35% below 2005 levels; electric power capacity target of 40% installed capacity from non-fossil-based energy resources by 2030 (conditional to international support); and creating a carbon sink expansion target of creating an additional (cumulative) carbon sink of 2.5–3 GtCO2e through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. CAT has rated the 40% non-fossil energy as “Critically insufficient” and the emissions intensity target as “Highly insufficient.” If all countries were to follow India’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C according to CAT. The rating is based on what global least cost modelled domestic pathways say India needs to be doing, with international support, to achieve the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 degree C limit. As of July 2021, India had 39% non-fossil installed capacity based on Central Electricity Authority’s data. India is poised to achieve its 40% non-fossil capacity target a decade early. India is on track to achieve around 60-65% of non-fossil installed capacity by 2030 states CAT. “If India were to achieve the top of that range - 65% non-fossil installed capacity in 2030 - instead, our rating would improve, but only by one category to ‘Highly insufficient’. Even if India is not responsible for paying for all reductions, it should plan on how fast it could reduce its emissions if there were sufficient international support available, and not to lock into a high carbon future. This would mean to begin phasing out coal use and adopt emission reduction plans across the economy, and to clearly specify what international support it requires to achieve this goal,” CAT states. India’s current policies also indicate rising, rather than falling of emissions and is not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 degree C temperature limit. India also doesn’t have net -zero emissions target by 2050, flags CAT which is supported by several foundations and governments including the European Climate Foundation and the German Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) etc. Among various other policies, CAT has highlighted that while India has been reducing its share of global coal power, it continues to be the second largest coal pipeline globally, behind China and has over 200 GW of coal-fired capacity in operation. The Central Electricity Authority projects this will increase to almost 266 GW over the next few years. There is a significant risk that India’s coal assets will be stranded, especially when considering that two thirds of India’s coal-fired power plants were built in the last 10 years, CAT states. Interestingly, India has used CAT’s analysis several times in the past to showcase that it was among few countries globally to have a 2 degree C compliant NDC. “Countries should be assessed on the promises delivered not just words but deeds,” said a senior environment ministry official who did not wish to be named, responding to the analysis."

" The number of extremely hot days in a year – when the temperature soars past the 50 degrees Celsius mark – has doubled across the world since the 1980s, according to an analysis by BBC which underlined the harsh realities of the global climate crisis. The study says the number of days on which the mercury goes past 50°C has been consistently going up in every subsequent decade since 1980. Between 1980 and 2009, temperatures went past the 50°C mark 14 days per year on average. But between 2010 and 2019, that number shot up to 26 days, the BBC analysis has found. That apart, the temperature mark of 45°C has also witnessed a sharp jump during the same time period, being recorded an extra two weeks per year on average. The 50°C mark is commonplace in the West Asia region, especially during the long summers. But climate scientists sat up and took note when nearly-50°C temperatures began to be recorded in more temperate parts of the world, such as in Canada and Italy, this summer. Italy witnessed a record high of 48.8°C and Canada saw the mercury shoot up to a high of 49.6°C. Climate experts fear that the dreaded 50°C mark could soon be recorded in more parts of the world unless fossil fuel emissions are kept on a tight leash. If more and more temperate parts of the planet see temperatures booming past the 50°C mark, the entire human race would end up facing unprecedented challenges. “We need to act quickly. The faster we cut our [fossil fuel] emissions, the better off we’ll all be,” says Dr Sihan Li, a climate researcher at School of Geography and Environment at University of Oxford, according to the BBC study. “With continued emissions and lack of action, not only will these extreme heat events become more severe and more frequent, but emergency response and recovery will become more challenging.” The same analysis also quotes Dr Friederike Otto, associate director of Environmental Change Institute at University of Oxford. “The increase [in temperatures] can be 100% attributed to the burning of fossil fuels,” says Dr Otto, echoing the concerns of Dr Li. Climate scientists fear that the unbridled burning of fossil fuels has invariably been resulting in the whole world warming up faster than before, which in turn would make extreme temperatures more likely in the near future. Experts fear, as the analysis points out, that extreme temperatures can be dangerous for both flora and fauna, with human civilisation facing unavoidable challenges, such as problems with infrastructure and power systems."
" The US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry on Monday congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi for India's ambitious climate targets and said that the developing country in the Global South has demonstrated that economic development and clean energy can go hand-in hand. Kerry who is on two-day visit to India, ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasglow in November, praised the country's goal to achieve 450GW of renewable energy by 2030. ""PM Modi has set very ambitious targets in India. The target of 450 GW by 2030, of renewable energy, is one of the most powerful goals in the world. You have already reached about 100 GW. I congratulate India for a remarkable milestone,"" Kerry said. He also expressed confidence that the target is achievable and that the US would “look forward to partnering with India.” Earlier in the day, Kerry met external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Union power minister RK Singh to discuss climate goals.  He then announced the Climate Action and Finance Mobilisation dialogue, one of the two main tracks of the US-India Agenda 2030 Partnership that US President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Modi announced at the Leaders Summit on Climate in April this year.  The Climate Action and Finance Mobilisation dialogue is aimed at serving as a “powerful avenue for US-India collaboration,” Kerry said. Kerry's is expected to meet ministers, policymakers and private sector leaders to discuss efforts to raise global climate ambition and ramp up India's clean energy transition, during his second visit to India. Kerry said India has also highlighted that clean energy isn't a choice any more. “I look forward to seeing this ambition hopefully given its proper due credit at COP26 in Glasgow,” he said.  He also urged the countries to come together and work towards reaching global net-zero emissions by 2050.  "

" India hosted the International Climate Summit 2021 in New Delhi on Friday to get the ball rolling for the country’s journey towards a carbon-free energy ecosystem and become a key global player in renewable energy. Hosted by the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Invest India, in collaboration with NITI Aayog, environment, forest & climate change ministry, CSIR, and the Union government’s department of science & technology, the International Climate Summit 2021 focused on the country’s ambitious Green Hydrogen Mission and forging partnerships in ramping up the transition towards net-zero carbon emissions through adopting clean energy. The summit began with a video excerpt from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech on India’s 75th Independence Day speech this year, where he announced the government's decision to set up the National Hydrogen Mission, aimed at making India the new global hub and exporter of green hydrogen. Speaking virtually at the summit next, Norwegian petroleum and energy minister Tina Bru said, “Green Hydrogen has the potential to realise low to zero-emission solutions in the transportation, industry, and shipping sectors thus opening up new opportunities in these sectors.” She said that climate change has no borders and the common challenge is to cut emissions, for which the world needs to come together and cooperate transcending borders. “India is the world's third-biggest consumer and producer of energy with rapidly growing consumption in the decades to come, we commend the eﬀorts of the Indian government in launching ambitious targets for developing clean energy. Closer collaboration between Indian and Norwegian companies can deﬁnitely accelerate our steps towards a common low-emission future,” Bru added. Norway was the partner country for Friday’s summit. Also Read | The costs of a net zero emission target Modi has set the country a target of 2047 — when India would celebrate its 100th Independence day — to achieve self-reliance in energy production through a mix of electric mobility, gas-based economy, doping ethanol in petrol to make the country a hub for hydrogen production. Minister of state (independent charge) for earth sciences and science & technology, Jitendra Singh India stressed the urgency to address climate challenges through consolidated approach and timely interventions while emphasising on shifting to cleaner options like green hydrogen as a potential energy source for a more sustainable future. ""Our undivided energies should be invested to attain our aim of minimising emission and that is only possible if we adopt a proactive approach. Green hydrogen will not only enable us to reduce emissions but also help India across several verticals and align with Prime Minister Modi's vision of our nation being self-reliant. It's about time that we collectively work towards making India a Green Hydrogen Hub, not just for ourselves but for the bigger picture where we are considerate of the world as a whole. We have the capability and the capacity to facilitate clean hydrogen energy for the world; this is the appropriate time to get into action and create a world worth thriving in,” the minister said. Jitendra Singh chose the occasion to launch the National Hydrogen Portal - www.greenhydrogen-India.com. It is a platform that will now become a one-stop information source for research, production, storage, transportation, and application of hydrogen across the country and technology. Meanwhile, Union environment minister Ashwini Chaubey stressed the need for creating a sustainable platform for clean energy. “We intend to achieve 40% of non-fossil usage by 2030, making a significant stride towards improving the current state of the country and establishing a green hydrogen ecosystem to smoothen the path to responsible living,” he said. The environment minister said the time has come to redirect our attention towards creating and sustaining an alternate source of energy and mandating it for developing and developed nations alike to take the onus to nurture the health and wellbeing of each one of us on this planet. Reliance Industries managing director Mukesh Ambani delivered the keynote address next in which he said that India is determined to achieve 'Azaadi' (freedom) from dependence on fossil energy and become 'Aatmanirbhar' (self-reliance) in new and renewable energy. ”Since climate change is undoubtedly the most daunting challenge facing human civilisation today, we should rapidly transition to a new era of clean, green, and renewable energy,” Ambani said. He stressed that by investing in smart microgrids, efficient storage solutions, and smart meters, we can enable individuals, neighbourhoods, and communities to become both consumers and producers of energy. Green hydrogen, zero-carbon energy will play a fundamental role in the world's decarbonisation plans. Ambani outlined Reliance’s plan to become a net-zero carbon company by 2035, in line with India’s target to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Also Read | By switching on the sun, Railways can prevent 7mn tonnes of carbon emissions “We have prepared a new roadmap which will be the next big value creation engine for Reliance and India. We have started developing the Dhirubhai Ambani green energy giga-complex over 5,000 acres in Jamnagar, Gujarat. It will be amongst the largest, integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities anywhere in the world,” Dhirubhai Ambani said. “Over the next 3 years, we will invest over ₹75,000 crores in these initiatives to create a fully integrated end-to-end renewable energy ecosystem for the Indians.” Reliance aims to produce 100GW of solar energy by 2030 out of India's goal to reach 450 GW. International Climate Summit 2021 witnessed the coming together of policymakers, academicians, and industry experts from Norway and India in their quest for green energy solutions and to arrive at a consensus in matters pertaining to climate change and sustainability. Christian Valdes Carter, director, Innovation Norway India, said India is among the best-suited countries to produce green hydrogen, and stressed that Norway and India have partnered to promote a green economy. “Norway has more than 50 different hydrogen projects at various stages of development in 50 different places,” he said.

" The Indian Railways can offset around 7 million tonnes of carbon every year if it harnesses the energy from the sun. Not only that but it can also run one in four trains on the national network powered by solar energy and save in fuel costs to the tune of ₹17,000 crore. The latest findings lend credence to Union minister Piyush Goyal’s ambitious target of turning the Indian Railways into the world’s first net-zero carbon emitter by 2030. The minister had issued directives to railways to identify huge areas of unproductive land for setting up solar power plants to generate electricity for the national transporter. About 51,000 hectares of unused railway land has been identified for the purpose and the Indian Railways and the Union ministry of railways have formed a joint venture — Railway Energy Management Company — to support the development of solar photovoltaics and wind energy projects to supply the railway’s energy needs. Plans are already underway to deliver 20GW of solar-powered electricity to match the demand for energy to move trains. During his speech on the India's 75th Independence Day this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also announced the country's plan to become a net-zero carbon emitter by 2050 and highlighted that work was underway for 100% electrification of Indian Railways. On the track of net-zero emissions If the Indian Railways can achieve this target, it would lead to an annual emissions reduction of at least 15 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, which could help meet 5% of India’s targeted nationally determined contributions (NDC) to mitigate the effects of climate change. Together, these will help India reach its renewable energy target of 450GW by 2030. The analysis, part of a joint study by Delhi-based Climate Trends and the UK-based green-tech start-up Riding Sunbeams, highlights that around a quarter of the 20GW solar capacity —up to 5,272 MW — could be fed directly into the overhead power lines of the railways instead of being procured over the electricity networks, reducing transmission and distribution losses and saving money. “India is leading the world on two vital climate frontiers, including electrification of the railway network and solar power deployment. Connecting two of these keystone low-carbon technologies in Indian Railways can drive both India’s economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and its efforts to transition off fossil fuels to tackle the climate crisis,” Leo Murray, the founder of Riding Sunbeams said. The researchers found that substituting energy supplied from the coal-dominated grid for private-wire supply from solar could also rapidly cut emissions by as much as a 6.8million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year. Power of 100% electrification The national transporter chose World Environment Day — celebrated every June 5 — this year to announce its plan to complete the electrification of the entire railway network by 2023 to reduce pollution, and leapfrog into its path of net-zero carbon emitter by 2030. ""Head-On-Generation systems, bio-toilets, and LED lights recreate the train itself into a travel mode that's kinder to the environment while maintaining comparable passenger comfort,"" the officials of the world’s second-largest railway network said in a statement on June 5. As per the Paris Agreement on climate change, India has pledged to reduce the intensity of emissions by 33-35% by 2030 from 2005-levels. One of the ways India can achieve its goal of shifting to non-fossil-fuel-based energy for 40% of its cumulative electricity generation capacity by 2030 is by transitioning the Indian Railways into a green transport medium. Indian Railways is the single largest consumer of electricity in India and is heavily dependent on coal-based power generation. The railways consume 20 TWh of electricity per year, which is roughly 2% of the country's total power generation. In 2019-20, the locomotives in the national network consumed 23,79,865 kilolitres of diesel and around 1,000 tonnes of coal to run. Cost of transition to clean energy Converting all current diesel traction to electric modes would initially cause a 32% increase in emissions due to India’s reliance on coal to produce electricity. The emissions intensity of the Indian electricity grid is 825 tonnes carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e)/ GWh, over three times higher than the emissions intensity from the UK, for example. To mitigate this, the Indian Railways would need either to procure its supply of clean electricity from solar and wind generators connected directly into the rail network, or develop new grid-connected renewable projects to match the traction energy supplied via the electricity grid. “There has been analysis that converting all diesel locomotives to electric will indeed increase the emissions in the short term, however, this report shows the tremendous opportunity of doing it right the first time, by creating a direct connection of the locomotive system to solar PV installations, meeting more than a quarter of the total demand,” Aarti Khosla, the director at Climate Trends, who co-authored the study, said. As per the Niti Aayog data, the Indian Railway contributed to around 6.84 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emission in 2014. The researchers, however, warned that achieving the target of 100% electrification in all routes by 2023 could be accompanied by an increase in carbon dioxide emissions in the short term because of India’s current reliance on coal to produce electricity.

" Within 25 to 30 years, South Mumbai's Nariman Point, the state secretariat will go be engulfed by the rising seawater level, Mumbai municipal corporation Iqbal Singh Chahal has recently said. There are enough warnings that nature is giving, but if people do not wake up, the situation will take such a dangerous turn that 80 per cent of areas like Cuffe Parade, Nariman Point and Mantralaya will just disappear, Singh said. The disaster will not be for the next generation to witness, the civic chief said, adding that people from this generation only will see it as it might take place in another 25 years. Climate experts have observed that Mumbai, of late, witnessed some extreme weather conditions, the latest being the recent thunderstorm that took place in the city in July. In 2020, cyclone Nisarga hit Mumbai fr the first time in 129 years and then in the last 15 months, there have been three cyclones. ""On August 5, 2020, about 5 to 5.5 feet water was accumulated at Nariman point. There was no cyclone warning that day, but considering the parameters, it was a cyclone,"" Chahal said. ""Earlier, we used to hear about climate change events like melting glaciers, but not directly affecting us. But now it has come to our doorstep,"" he added. This year's monsoon has been erratic as the city received maximum rainfall before the scheduled date of the monsoon's arrival. Before June 9, Mumbai recorded 84 per cent of the June rainfall. In July too, instead of being equally distributed across the month, the maximum rainfall took place over four days. ""The four-year period between 2017 and 2020 has seen a steady increase in the extremely heavy rainfall events. This indicates that the frequency of such extreme weather events is increasing for the city of Mumbai especially over the past four years,"" said Lubaina Rangwala, associate director, WRI India Ross Center for Sustainable Cities."
" India can gain $11 trillion in economic value over the next 50 years by limiting rising global temperatures and realising its potential to ‘export decarbonisation’ to the world, a new study by Deloitte Economics Institute shows. The study infers that if India doesn’t act now to mitigate the effects of climate change, it could lose $35 trillion in economic potential, which could be 12.7% of its gross domestic product (GDP), by 2070. The report, titled, India’s turning point: How climate action can drive our economic future, shows that no action taken on climate change, the average global temperatures could rise by 3°C or more by the end of this century. This will make it harder for people to live and work, as sea levels rise, crop yields fall, infrastructure is damaged, and other challenges emerge, threatening the progress and prosperity that the nation has enjoyed in recent decades. Deloitte India chairperson Atul Dhawan said India has about a decade to make decisions that can help change the trajectory of climate change. Even as Dhawan acknowledged that no one is immune to the impact of climate change, he called it a “window of opportunity” for India to lead the way and show how climate action is not a narrative of cost but one of sustainable economic growth. “As India aspires to be a $5 trillion economy, it is not just foreign and domestic investments that will be key in driving growth but we must also take this opportunity to align our ambitions with climate choices,” Dhawan said. Over the next 50 years, the top five most impacted industries in terms of economic activity are expected to incur a significant share of climate-related loss. These industries —services (government and private), manufacturing, retail and tourism, construction, and transport — currently account for more than 80% of India’s GDP. Together, they form the basis of the country’s contemporary economic engine. According to an estimate by Deloitte, these five industries alone could experience an annual loss in the value-added to GDP of more than $1.5 trillion per year by 2070. However, if governments, businesses, and communities act rapidly in the next decade to address climate change, average global temperature rises can be limited to around 1.5°C by 2050, a scenario that will minimise the impact of climate change for India and the rest of the world. At the same time, India can achieve significant economic growth by supplying the products, services, and financing that the world would need to limit a rise in temperature. India is home to many enterprises that are already world-leading producers of the advanced solutions countries would need to address climate change. These include green hydrogen and negative-emission solutions, both natural and technological. “We need to transform the world’s economies towards new, low-emission pathways and India is well-positioned to play a leading role in this process globally. By making the right choices now, India could chart a more prosperous path towards a low-emission future, accelerating progress in the rest of the world by exporting key technologies, processes, and know-how,” says Viral Thakker, a partner and sustainability leader at Deloitte India. Accelerated decarbonisation could bring significant benefits to India and the world. India could use the transition to a low-emission footing to restructure its economy towards growth in advanced industrial sectors, leveraging lower-cost clean energy export markets, as the region experiences a rapid increase in energy demand over the coming years. As a developing nation, India’s transformation to a low-emission footing is likely to be more complex and challenging than much of the rest of AsiaPacific. It will have to strike a delicate balance between the need for sustained economic development—and the corresponding rise in energy demand—and investing in and transitioning to emerging, low-emission technologies. The structural adjustment costs associated with reducing India’s emissions profile are expected to be significant, but the cost of inaction will be greater. Rapid decarbonisation through broad changes in its energy mix and industrial base will significantly transition India away from fossil fuel sources, falling to 5% by 2070. This transition would see India restructure its economy toward growth in advanced industrial sectors, leverage clean energy global export markets with affordable clean energy technologies. The modelling used in the report shows that rapid decarbonization could yield economic gains of almost $11 trillion (in present value terms) for India’s economy by 2070. Compared to a world of climate inaction, India’s GDP would grow by an average of 1% per year over the modelled decades to 2070. The report sets out four key stages for India’s climate transition. According to the forecast made by Deloitte, economic benefits would be observed from the first year that positive climate policy decisions start delivering rapid investment and technology development. In 2070 alone, this would equate to a GDP growth of 8.5%. The transition to a cleaner world: 2021 to 2030—Bold climate plays: The next few years set the stage for rapid decarbonization. The decisions by government, regulators, business, industry and consumers would reinforce initial progress and create the market conditions to deliver decarbonization at pace and scale. This would send price signals, transform supply chains, and lay the foundation for a structural shift that limits global average warming to 1.5°C. During this first phase, India would need to forgo some short-term economic development in favour of significant investment in sustainable technologies. 2030 to 2040—Coordinated change: The hardest shifts in industrial policy, energy systems, and consumer behaviour would occur in this period. Businesses and economies would begin to see the consequences of bold climate plays, with different industries and countries transforming at different paces. India would continue to undergo significant structural changes during this decade, and net economic gains of the transformation would still be on the horizon. 2040 to 2055—Turning point: The decarbonization of high-emitting industries should be nearly complete by this period. The cost of new low-emission technologies would be decreasing and net economic gains would be shared more widely. Efforts to curb emissions would begin to manifest in the lower global average. India would enter a net positive economic position by 2051, with gains gradually increasing towards the end of the century—a direct benefit of decarbonization and the avoided cost of climate change. 2055 onwards—A low-emission future: By the end of the century, India’s economy would be near net-zero emissions and the world’s economic systems of production would be keeping global average warming to around 1.5°C. Economic structures would be radically transformed, underpinned by a series of interconnected, low-emission systems spanning energy, mobility, manufacturing, and food and land use. The energy mix would be dominated by low- or zero-emission sources across every market, with green hydrogen and negative-emission solutions, both natural and technological, playing prominent roles. India would now be rapidly accruing the economic dividends of global decarbonization, in a low-emission future that benefits the Asia Pacific and the world. Mainstream economic theory and models assume unconstrained emissions do not have negative consequences for economic growth potential. This view of the world has now come up against the overwhelming scientific consensus—and our own experiences—telling us that the current system of economic production is generating untenable changes in the climate. These changes put at risk India’s hard-earned economic growth and prosperity. India’s climate, as well as its large population and economic dependence on agriculture, mean it is particularly exposed to the effects of unchecked climate change. As average global temperatures continue to rise, extreme weather events—such as flooding and heatwaves—would become increasingly common and devastating throughout the region. Rising sea levels would impact a large number of communities in coastal areas, particularly through damage to capital infrastructure. With about a quarter of India’s rural population currently living in poverty, their capacity to swiftly recover from future climate events would likely be very limited."
" India ratified the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer on Wednesday, paving the way for phasing down on hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), a group of warming gases a thousand times more potent than carbon dioxide. HFCs are harmful greenhouse gases, used in air-conditioners and refrigerators, as an alternative to ozone-depleting gases hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol has the potential to avoid 0.5°C of warming of the atmosphere by the end of the century. India’s ratification follows a similar move by China and the United States earlier this year and will be the 123rd ratification of the important treaty amendment. Given India's commitment to play a constructive role in climate action, the Union Cabinet's decision is a step towards New Delhi advancing its targets to mitigate the effects of climate change, ahead of the United Nations climate change conference (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland in October this year. “India’s Kigali Amendment ratification is among the most significant of any country, and brings us to the cusp of universal ratification among the world’s biggest economies,"" remarked Alex Hillbrand, an HFC expert at Natural Resources Defense Council, that is working on the global phase-down of global warming-potential gases. ALSO READ | Walking the talk on climate commitments India is one of the first countries in the world to launch a cooling action plan in 2019. The plan is linked to the economic growth and need for cooling and refrigeration over the next few decades. This comprehensive plan is aimed at reducing cooling demand, enabling refrigerant transition, enhancing energy efficiency and better technology options with a 20-year time horizon. The signing of the Kigali Amendment is a cue for the markets to make a faster transition from HFCs to cleaner gases. Professor S N Tripathi, the head of civil engineering, department at IIT Kanpur, and a member of the steering committee of environment ministry's National Clean Air Programme, said, “The Montreal Protocol had realised the need for phasing out HFCs which were responsible for the depletion of the Ozone layer. The tireless efforts that led to the Kigali Amendment have resulted in the agreement of phasing out the HFCs in a timebound manner. Many HFCs have very high global warming potential. India’s ratification of the Kigali amendment is a welcome decision that will collectively help avoid 0.5°C, which is a significant climate co-benefit.” Even as India is not obliged to begin phasing down HFCs before 2028, the ratification would offer clarity to air-conditioning and refrigeration industries to develop more efficient and climate-friendly cooling technologies. ALSO READ | Can’t wait for years to take action: COP 26 president Alok Sharma on climate crisis A fact sheet from The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and Natural Resources Defense Council (NDRC) India ratifying the Kigali Amendment is an advantage for the country in itself as it would boost domestic manufacturing and employment generation goals. The ratification would signify that India is ready to compete in the market for low-global warming potential GWP (climate-friendly) refrigerants, which will spur domestic innovation and attract international investments. ""India has exemplified its climate leadership by ratifying the Kigali Amendment. There is a big opportunity for the country to be on course for an early phasedown of HFCs, through domestic innovation, which would also make the Indian industry globally competitive in climate-friendly cooling products. India's move fits in well with its plan for a green recovery, as we build back better,"" said Prima Madan, the lead consultant of energy efficiency and cooling, at NRDC in India. Not only that but the decision would pave way for India to achieve its climate change mitigation goals and cooling commitments. India is among a small group of countries on track to meet its climate commitments under the Paris Agreement. The latest IPCC report on climate change, released last week, portrayed a grim scenario. It cautioned that the 1.5°C global warming threshold is likely to be breached in the next 10-to-20 years in all emission scenarios, including the one where carbon dioxide emissions decline. India's ratification of the Kigali Amendment would put New Delhi in a position of strength at the Montreal Protocol. It would help bolster India’s efforts to establish smart policies and bylaws, including on energy efficiency, while phasing down HFCs. A senior programme lead at Council on Energy, Environment and Water, Shikha Bhasin called the ratification of the Kigali Amendment before its peaking year a ""feather in India’s cooling and climate cap"" ahead of COP26 this year. ""It’s the right signal to ensure low-GWP and alternative cooling technologies’ deployment not just in one of the world’s largest cooling markets, but also for several countries around the world considering climate actions in this pivotal year,"" she said.

" In the last few years, the discussions on climate ambition have primarily focused on either nationally determined contribution (NDC) targets committed within the framework of the Paris Agreement, or respective countries’ net-zero commitments. While these mid-century ambitions are essential for achieving the 1.5°C global warming target set in the Paris Agreement, it is equally important to study the outcomes of the emission reduction pledges made by developed countries before the Paris Agreement, in the pre-2020 climate regime. The fate of post-2020 negotiations for climate change crucially hinge upon the achievements, gaps, and issues recognised in the pre-2020 period. However, post-2020 ambitions announced by developed countries have been set without due consideration of their past performance. Concerns continue to be expressed about the implementation of pre-2020 commitments by developing countries and were most recently emphasised in decision 1/CP.23. The issue was also discussed at the 25th Conference of Parties (COP 25) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The cost of unmet climate commitments by developed countries The significance of pre-2020 climate actions by developed countries can be broadly encapsulated across three dimensions: environmental, political, and economic. Environmental: The World Meteorological Organization highlighted that the global carbon dioxide concentration has already exceeded 410 parts per million (ppm), impacting our ecosystems, marine life, and increasing the global average temperature to record high levels (WMO 2021). There is a 40% chance that the annual average global temperature would exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels in the next five years (WMO 2021). This 1.5°C marker is identified as a key tipping point1 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) beyond which environmental risks are likely to be extreme (IPCC 2018). Political: The gaps in pre-2020 climate actions are also of grave concern from an equity perspective. The developing countries have concerns of bearing the burden of tackling the mitigation gaps from the pre-2020 period in the future. Furthermore, it has caused a further fissure between the developed and developing country groupings, contributing to mistrust on the next set of ambitions that were tabled in the negotiations. Economic: The cost of mitigation efforts is expected to increase significantly in the future compared to the pre-2020 period. According to the World Economic Forum, inactions towards climate change would cost the world $1.7 trillion per year by 2050 (Januta 2021). Based on the principle of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC), the onus to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for a long time was placed on developed countries (also referred to as Annex I Parties). This principle was operationalised within the UNFCCC through two international climate agreements: the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol (2012). Both these agreements assigned quantified emission reduction targets to developed countries, based on their 1990 emission levels. Under the Kyoto Protocol, an emission reduction target of 5%, based on 1990 levels, was set to be achieved by developed countries in the first commitment period (2008–2012). In contrast, under the Doha Amendment, it was agreed that an emission reduction target of at least 18% would be met by developed countries in the second commitment period (2013–2020). Mapping emission mitigation achieved by developed countries in the pre- 2020 period. Research focusing on emission reductions in the pre-2020 period has been scarce. As a result, there is little clarity on the performance of developed countries under the Kyoto Protocol and the Doha Amendment. To fill this gap, CEEW has undertaken a review of mitigation outcomes for all developed countries vis-a-vis their overall commitment under the Kyoto Protocol and the Doha Amendment and the results are presented in this report. This first-of-its-kind accounting evaluation conducted in a developing country seeks to provide a clear picture of the performance of developed countries in the pre-2020 era. It does so by identifying areas of accounting concerns, gaps in achievements vis-à-vis set targets, and based on these, sets forth a framework for easy comparisons among mitigation achievements of developed countries. The key findings of our study are highlighted below. Pre-2020 outcomes characterised by poor participation and performance The implementation of the Kyoto Protocol and the Doha Amendment witnessed several setbacks. Several developed countries did not participate in these climate agreement discussions. The lack of participation resulted in the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol not coming into force for almost its entire duration (before December 31, 2020). In the first commitment period (2008–2012), a total of 36 Annex I countries and the European Union pledged emission reduction targets. Some of the notable exceptions were the United States (US) and Canada. Furthermore, Cyprus, Malta, and Kazakhstan were not included among Annex I countries during the first commitment period and so have been mentioned among the non-participating countries in Table ES1. In the second commitment period (2013–2020), the participation fell significantly as other large emitters like Japan and the Russian Federation did not accept the new emission reduction targets of at least 18% compared to their base year levels. Furthermore, the countries that participated in the discussions on these two agreements also misused the existing accounting provisions to achieve their targets. The outcomes of our study provide a grim picture of the emission reductions that have been achieved by developed countries since 1990. The greenhouse gas emissions from Annex A sources for all Annex I Parties (both industrialised and economies in transition [EIT] countries) declined only by about 14.8% in 2019 compared to their base year emissions levels. This reduction is quite low considering the emission reduction targets were set at a minimum of 18% below the 1990 levels to be achieved by 2020 under the Doha Amendment. More dramatically, the non-EIT Annex I Parties (majorly comprising industrialised countries) witnessed a meagre emission reduction of 3.7% by 2019 compared to their base year emissions levels. Thus, the 14.8% emission reduction was made possible largely due to the contribution of EIT countries, which collectively showed a decline of about 39% below the base year emissions levels. The impressive 39% reduction in emissions achieved by the EIT countries is not due to emission reduction measures undertaken by them but were due to the economic downturn in the 1990–1997 period, during which the emissions declined by 38%. The economic shock suffered by these countries was the outcome of their transition from a centrally planned economy to a market-based economy. This led to the generation of unearned emissions allowance (equivalent to about 28.4 GtCO2eq) acquired by these countries in the 2008–2020 period. These unearned emissions allowances are also referred to as ‘hot air’, resulting from inflated base year emissions. Also, the non-participation of the US in both the commitment periods adversely affected the global climate action in more than one way. The United States emitted about 11 and 26% more than their estimated emission allowance in the Kyoto Protocol and the Doha Amendment, respectively. Citing US non-participation as the reason, Canada and Japan also withdrew from the climate agreements. New Zealand and the Russian Federation also did not accept new targets in the Doha Amendment. This led to additional usage of carbon space of about 10.9 GtCO2eq by non- participating countries than their estimated emission allowance in the Kyoto Protocol and the Doha Amendment. Also, Annex A emissions from the non-participating countries represented about 47% (41.3 GtCO2eq ) in the first commitment period and 71% (96.1 GtCO2eq) in the second commitment period of the total commitment period emissions by all developed countries. In contrast, the participating countries, especially the European countries, seem to have performed well and emitted significantly less than their emission allowances in the aggregated pre-2020 period. France, Spain, Italy, and the UK collectively are estimated to have unused (left-over) emissions allowance of about 2.3 GtCO2eq by the end of 2020. And collectively, the participating countries have unused carbon space of about 14.4 GtCO2eq. However, these apparent overachievements (14.8 GtCO2eq) of the participating countries are the outcome of unearned emission allowance due to the selection of inflated base year and inclusion of deforestation emissions in their base year emissions. Australia primarily benefitted from adding deforestation emissions to its base year emissions and gained unearned emissions allowance equivalent to 1.4 GtCO2eq. If the total unearned emissions allowance (14.4 GtCO2eq) of the participating countries is considered, then the overachievement of the participating countries in the 2008–2020 period is almost nullified. On extending these accounting criteria to the non-participating countries, it is observed that, collectively, both the participating and non-participating Annex I countries, under the Kyoto Protocol and the Doha Amendment, have emitted about 25.1 GtCO2eq more than their estimated emission allowances in the 2008–2020 period. Pre-2020 climate actions: ranking the developed countries As an extension of the pre-2020 analysis, The Council has ranked all the 43 developed countries based on its sincerity and performance in mitigation efforts during the pre-2020 period. This ranking system developed by The Council is unique as it explicitly focuses on the pre-2020 climate agreements: the Kyoto Protocol and the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol. The purpose of this ranking is threefold: (1) to provide an independent and comprehensive evaluation of the efforts undertaken by developed countries towards meeting their pre-2020 targets; (2) to enhance transparency by enabling an easy comparison of pre- 2020 performance among developed countries; and (3) to identify developed countries that have been climate champions in the pre-2020 period. In order to compare their pre-2020 mitigation performances, Annex I countries were analysed and rated on their seriousness and faithfulness towards climate action (sincerity), as well as the overall mitigation performance (action) in the pre-2020 period. Figure ES2 highlights the indicators and broad categories against which Annex I countries were analysed and rated. The ranking reveals that European countries have performed relatively better than non-European countries. Sweden leads the overall action indicator performance with a score of 95%, followed by the UK, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, and the Netherlands. While most of the EIT countries fall in the middle of the ranking order, the non-participating developed countries are placed at the bottom. Some major economies such as the Russian Federation, Turkey, Canada, and the US have scored around 50% and less. Our ranking makes it clear that developed countries have performed at various levels with respect to their emission reduction targets in the pre- 2020 period. Also, the additional consumption of carbon space (25.1 GtCO2eq) is quite significant and needs to be addressed in order to limit the temperature below 1.5oC by 2100. However, the burden of these gaps emerging from the pre-2020 period should not be transferred to developing countries but distributed among developed countries themselves. Hence, the non-EIT Annex I countries, especially the non-participating countries, should consider revising or enhancing their future targets. Another way to bridge this pre-2020 gap would be developed countries, which did not participate in the Kyoto Protocol and the Doha Amendment, purchasing the unsold certified emission reductions (CERs) and voluntarily cancel the unearned carbon emission allowance. This would be a win-win decision for both developing and developed countries because it would not only increase the demand of CERs in the sluggish market but also help developed countries comply with their pre-2020 targets without carrying them forward (post-2020 period). Further, it is imperative to strengthen the accounting and compliance mechanism to fill the existing loopholes and ensure misuse of accounting does not occur in the post-2020 climate regimes. The accounting provisions should reflect environmental integrity and should not be curtailed at the convenience of the participating countries. Finally, the easy exit of countries from climate agreement should be restricted as it not only results in additional burden but also undermines the trust in the process of negotiations itself and dissuades other nations from undertaking ambitious target.

" Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates on Thursday said his climate fund would pour $1.5 billion into projects with the United States if the government enacts a program to cut carbon emissions currently working its way through Congress. A $1.2 trillion infrastructure package passed by the US Senate this week would funnel billions of dollars to the Department of Energy for projects battling climate change. If the infrastructure package becomes law, ""this collaboration will not only send us on a more durable path to net zero, but will create both immediate and long-term jobs in communities across the country,"" Gates said in a statement published by CNBC. By funding work on roads, bridges, and ports, as well as clean water and high-speed internet, US President Joe Biden said the bill -- which still needs House approval -- would create thousands of high-paying jobs for people without college degrees. ""This historic investment in infrastructure is what I believe you, the American people, want,"" Biden said in a White House address. Needing just a simple majority, the package passed by 69 votes to 30 with backing from a third of Republican Senators. The measure now faces a make-or-break vote in the House of Representatives in coming weeks, where its future is less certain as divisions have sprung up in the Democratic majority. The ambitious plan provides for $550 billion in new federal spending on transport infrastructure, and also for public transit, broadband internet, and clean water, as well as electric charging stations and other measures to fight climate change. A Gates fund run by his Breakthrough Energy company would spend the $1.5 billion over the course of three years with the goal of eliminating greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change, according to US media reports. Projects could include airplanes that don't spew pollution and technology for capturing carbon from the air. ""Critical for all these climate technologies is to get the costs down and to be able to scale them up to a pretty gigantic level,"" Gates was quoted as telling the Wall Street Journal."
" India’s unusually centralised form of federalism presents unique challenges to climate action. Powers and capacities substantially concentrated in the central government are uneasily juxtaposed against the nature of the climate problem, whose solutions often turn on the outcomes of localised politics in mitigation and adaptation. The central government holds fiscal powers and bureaucratic capabilities more potent than the states, and the ability to set the agenda in many realms of climate policy (including those under state jurisdiction such as water and agriculture). But the states are solely responsible for many sectors crucial to climate governance, play an indispensable role in crafting appropriate political conditions for implementation and, crucially, in innovating to set policy examples for national emulation. Any effective model of Indian climate governance would, therefore, require each level of government to compensate for the jurisdictional, capacity, and informational constraints of other levels (Pillai and Dubash 2021). Building a compensatory relationship of this sort between the Centre and states will require modifications to India’s federal institutions. Moreover, climate mitigation and adaptation challenges often spill over jurisdictional borders and change over time, calling for coordination and the circulation of new solutions within the federal structure. Addressing climate impacts and engaging in sustainability transformations across states with different capacities and levels of development underscores the need for an equalising Centre, not least, a central government making pledges in the international arena must work with the states to develop and implement policy if these are to be effectively implemented across Indian states. Attempts to create climate linkages between the Centre and states have thus far failed to yield enduring results. This brief is built around lessons from federal interactions in periods of heightened climate policy activity. India’s experiences with the State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs), now a decade distant, revealed significant institutional shortcomings. First, the federal system failed to carry the momentum of an initial burst of policy enthusiasm into the present period. Second, the strategic space for states to build bespoke plans was constrained by a lack of capacity and the normative influence of the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) that immediately preceded the SAPCCs (Dubash and Jogesh 2014). Third, vagueness about financing diminished states’ enthusiasm over time (Kumar 2018). This policy brief outlines what it might take to unlock climate action while working with the grain of Indian federalism. We propose changes to the system that, when taken together, potentially harmonise actions across governments in the federation while preserving states’ political autonomy to experiment and innovate. We call this model one of ‘structured opportunism’. We aim to reform institutions to the benefit of both the national energy transition and climate resilience in the states.

" Global warming is dangerously close to spiralling out of control, a UN climate panel said in its report on Monday. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also said that the world is already certain to face further climate disruptions for decades, if not centuries, to come. The deadly heatwaves, massive hurricanes and other extreme events of weather will become more severe, the report further said. It noted that carbon dioxide has been and will continue to be the dominant cause of global warming under all greenhouse gas emissions scenarios."

" Experts have linked frequent cloudbursts in the hilly states of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu & Kashmir to climate change. However, the government said there is no scientific study to attribute the contribution of climate change in triggering cloudbursts. Between January and July this year, the Himalayan region witnessed at least 26 cloudbursts, according to data published in Down to Earth, which also attributed climate change and the fragile ecology of Himachal Pradesh to cloudbursts, frequent landslides and hill cracks in the state. Meanwhile, minister of state for environment, forests and climate change Ashwini Kumar Choubey told the Rajya Sabha in a written reply to A Vijaykumar on Monday that manifestations of extreme events, including cloudbursts, and their incidence are modelled and projected in various scientific assessments, and there is no established study for India estimating the quantified contribution of climate change in triggering such cloudbursts. ""The science of the attribution of such extreme events to climate change is far more complex and currently an evolving subject and being closely studied by Ministry of Earth Sciences, through the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and the India Meteorological Department,"" Choubey told the Parliament. While India Meteorological Department (IMD) did not officially report either of the phenomena as 'cloudbursts', regional authorities identified them. Cloudbursts are sudden and extreme rainfall events over a limited area in a short period, but there is no universal definition of the phenomenon. The IMD defines a cloudburst as any event where 100 millimetres of rainfall lashed a 20-30 square kilometres region in an hour. Munir Ahmad from the Indian Institute of Technology, Srinagar, said rapidly warming oceans are carrying moisture-rich air to the Himalayan region, which leads to cloudbursts. ""It is likely to occur more with an increase in moisture from the Indian Ocean,"" the expert said, adding while a rise in temperature in the Himalayan region and its relation to cloudburst is still a subject of further research, the rising temperature of the Indian Ocean, however, is a clear indication of climate change. A recent Down to Earth report said the environment department of the Himachal Pradesh government had warned in its State Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan that floods, landslides, glacial lake bursts, excess rainfall, excess snowfall and unseasonal rains would increase if the effects of climate change were not mitigated. A climate scientist at the University of Maryland in the United States, Raghu Murtugudde said the recent weather events in Uttarakhand were highly unusual and could have been caused by the warming of the region. ""What is unusual in the current scenario is the very warm temperature anomaly to the west of north India over Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Arabian heat low pumps winds into the northern Arabian Sea and there has been a strong wind along the coast of Oman and going straight over Gujarat into Uttarakhand. I guess that this is raising the chances of cloudbursts there,"" Murtugudde was quoted as saying by the Down to Earth in May last."
" As per the Global Climate Risk Index 2021 study, the world is confronting climate change, the biggest issue of the current time. India is ranking seventh as the most impacted country by climate change’s destructive effects in 2019. To pass on the information regarding climate change to everyone, a 21-year-old has started an initiative. Siddhant Sarang is a history undergraduate student at Satyawati College in Delhi. Since his days at school, he has been a close watcher of global climate-related events. He has created a podcast in Bhojpuri called ‘Dharti Maiya’. Hailing from Bihar, this youngster hopes to connect to rural communities in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh via podcast about climate change. According to the 2011 census, Bhojpuri is the eighth predominant language in India and the third most spoken language in Nepal, with 51 million native speakers. “I believe that an informed person is an empowered citizen. Information about climate and environmental changes is mostly available in English and, very few people understand it. India is a diverse country with a lot of languages and, very few people know English. So to widen the base of environmental awareness, I thought that information must be available in many languages. I took the first step and launched a podcast on climate change in Bhojpuri in February 2021,” Siddhant said, speaking to Life Beyond Numbers. “It occurred to me that we could make it multilingual using AI(Artificial Technology). In addition, I would like to engage the rural community in the subject of climate change, thus an application will be quite useful. We are developing an app and a website that will telecast the information in all 22 languages included in the Indian Constitution’s 8th list,” he added. This project also aims to support grassroots activists by sharing climate change information and successfully connecting with individuals. Born in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur region, Siddhant’s enthusiasm prompted him to create a short documentary movie on climate change during his school days, which won him an award. In 2019, Siddhant received Diana Award in honor of Princess Diana for his documentary film and environmental initiatives. He was also awarded the Queen’s Commonwealth Trust Scholarship, which enabled him to attend the One Young World Summit in London, UK. He was the first and only Indian to be awarded this scholarship. “I have been working on environmental issues since 2014. I accompanied my social worker father to the Saharsa district of Bihar, who was there for flood relief and rehabilitation works in the 2008 Bihar flood, one of the most disastrous floods in the history of Bihar that claimed thousands of lives. As a child, this was my first exposure to the complex outer world. I was in 7th standard, and after returning from the trip, I started learning about climate change. I later founded a youth-led organization Youth Frontliners with my classmates to work for environmental concerns in 2014 at the age of 14,” Siddhant said. He further added, “During this discourse, I also started a monthly journal named ‘Nature Lifeline’ with the purpose to raise awareness and garner support dedicated to the environment by adding pocket money with my friends at a tender age. Till now, I have engaged in many initiatives with organizations like Fridays For Future Delhi, FFF Bihar, Satyagrah For EIA 2020, etc.“ The world indeed needs more youth like you. Keep up the excellent work, Siddhant."
" Landslides are geomorphological processes that shape the landscapes of all continents, dismantling mountains and contributing sediments to the river networks. Caused by geophysical and meteorological triggers, including intense or prolonged rainfall, seismic shaking, volcanic activity, and rapid snow melting, landslides pose a serious threat to people, property, and the environment in many areas. Given their abundance and relevance, investigators have long experimented with techniques and tools for landslide detection and mapping using primarily aerial and satellite optical imagery interpreted visually or processed by semi-automatic or automatic procedures or algorithms. Optical (passive) sensors have known limitations due to their inability to capture Earth surface images through the clouds and to work in the absence of daylight. The long persistence of clouds in the monsoon seasons can then hamper the possibility of implementing continuous mapping systems in areas like Darjeeling, or Nilgiris, India where the Landslide multi-hazard risk assessment, preparedness and early warning in South Asia integrating meteorology, landscape and society (LANDSLIP) project deployed prototype early warning systems for rainfall induced landslides. The alternatives are active, “all-weather” and “day-and-night”, microwave radar sensors capable of seeing through the clouds and working in presence and absence of daylight. We review the literature on the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery to detect and map landslide failures – i.e., the single most significant movement episodes in the history of a landslide – and of landslide failure events – i.e., populations of landslides in areas ranging from a few to several thousand square kilometres caused by a single trigger. We examine 54 articles published in representative journals presenting 147 case studies in 32 nations, in all continents, except Antarctica. Analysis of the geographical location of 70 study areas shows that SAR imagery was used to detect and map landslides in most morphological, geological, seismic, meteorological, climate, and land cover settings. The time history of the case studies reveals the increasing interest of the investigators in the use of SAR imagery for landslide detection and mapping, with less than one article per year from 1995 to 2011, rising to about 5 articles per year between 2012 and 2020, and an average period of about 4.2 years between the launch of a satellite and the publication of an article using imagery taken by the satellite. To detect and map landslides, investigators use a common framework that exploits the phase and the amplitude of the electromagnetic return signal recorded in the SAR images, to measure terrain surface properties and their changes. To discriminate landslides from the surrounding stable terrain, a classification of the ground properties is executed by expert visual (heuristic) interpretation, or through numerical (statistical) modelling approaches. The existing knowledge on landslide processes and the current technological capabilities are adequate to design, implement, and manage landslide detection and mapping services operating in the test areas of the project. The unique abilities of microwave radar sensors make SAR sensors particularly well suited for the rapid detection and mapping of landslides caused by large events, when timely information on landslide occurrence is required e.g., for rescue operations and emergency management, as well as to construct multi-temporal landslide inventories Despite 26 years of undisputed progress, a number of theoretical, research, and operational challenges remain to be faced for the effective use of SAR imagery for landslide detection and mapping. For the challenges to be met, standards and shared best practices are needed to assess and hopefully reduce uncertainty, ensure repeatability and reproducibility, avoid misinterpretation and facilitate comparisons.

" Global efforts to tackle climate change suffered another setback this week as India -- the world’s third-biggest emitter -- failed to attend a key diplomatic gathering in London. India was the only one of 51 invited countries that didn’t attend a two-day ministerial meeting in the UK capital, hosted by the incoming president of the COP26 United Nations talks, according to people present at the summit who asked not to be named. The conference was designed to lay the groundwork for a successful COP26, which is due to take place in Glasgow in three months time. COP26 President Alok Sharma has said it will be the last chance to ensure global temperature increases don’t exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius -- the lower limit of the Paris Agreement. A Group of 20 meeting last week failed to clinch a more ambitious agreement on climate, and India was a key holdout. The London event was positioned to follow on from the G-20 with a broader group, meeting mainly in person. India had been due to attend the conference, according to a statement released by Sharma’s office beforehand. Gaurav Khare, a spokesman for India’s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, said the government had decided against attending in person as the country had already made its views known at the G-20 in Naples. Then technical issues prevented it from taking part virtually. Sharma “has constructive ongoing dialogue with his counterparts in India, having visited the country earlier this year where he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” a spokeswoman for COP26 said. India’s failure to show was perceived as a snub by the COP presidency, one of the people present at the London summit said. With all of the Group of Seven nations now having committed to eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the presidency is seeking to put pressure on emerging economies such as China and India. Sticking Points The main sticking points to achieving the goals of the Paris accord are agreeing on concrete actions and a firm timeline to phasing out fossil fuels and subsidies, as well as commitments to ditch coal, the people said. The world’s richest countries are also falling well short of financial pledges to support energy transitions in developing countries, they said. India held out at the Naples meeting last week, with the final communique from the gathering included a footnote saying the country rejected the language agreed on net-zero emissions. India is not alone in resisting these efforts, with a handful of other countries reluctant to sign up to the plans in full. The nation -- which has often taken the position that the richest countries should lead in cutting emissions -- criticized those that have promised to achieve net-zero carbon by 2050. It instead urged G-20 nations to make a pledge that focused on per-capita emissions. While India is the third-largest emitter on a country basis, it is also the second-most populous. As a result, emissions per head are extremely low, ranking 134, according to the Global Carbon Atlas project. “Keeping in view the legitimate need of developing countries to growth, we urge G-20 countries to commit to bringing down per-capita emissions to global average by 2030,” India said in a statement attached to the final G20 document. Earlier this year, India had been mulling setting its own net-zero target by 2050, according to people familiar with the matter. A statement about the plan had been expected during a White House climate summit in April, but never came. “With less than 100 days until COP26, India faces a clear decision: follow its friends in favor of an ambitious outcome on climate in Glasgow, or leave itself starkly isolated on the world stage by continuing to oppose the need for accelerated climate action before COP26,” said Tom Evans, a researcher at the think tank E3G."
" India failed to attend a two-day meeting of 51 countries where key issues regarding the Paris climate deal were discussed over the weekend and through Monday, according to officials who cited technical difficulties. The meeting was closed-door ministerial conference which was meant to take stock of global efforts to fight the climate crisis and the efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C (as part of the Paris climate accord) ahead of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow this November. The meeting was called by COP26 president-designate, Alok Sharma and India was invited following the G20 joint ministerial on energy and climate last week. “We attended the G20 ministerial and made our stand clear. The UK Climate ministerial was right after that. It was being held in the middle of the Parliament session so it was decided that this time we cannot be present. On an official level we wanted to participate virtually but we couldn’t because of various technical issues” said Gaurav Khare, spokesperson, ministry of environment, forest and climate change. On the outcome of the ministerial meeting, Sharma’s office said: “Climate ministers have taken a step forward towards a successful COP26, as a constructive meeting in London concluded with countries coming closer together on key issues such as actions to keep the 1.5C goal alive, adaptation finance and concluding the Paris rulebook.” The Paris rulebook is basically the implementation guidelines to execute the Paris Agreement. According to a note issued by the UK government on Monday, Sharma was quoted saying: “We made progress over these two days. And there was a clear spirit of cooperation. However, the issues we have discussed are complex. There are still significant differences that persist. We have moved closer together. But still, on these vital issues we are not yet close enough.” The statement also said that over the past two days, countries had reached a common understanding that COP26 needs to keep 1.5°C within reach. Ministers participating at the meeting called for all countries to deliver long-term strategies towards net zero before COP26. The meeting will take place in a year when multiple freak weather events have brought back focus on climate change, especially in the western world. These incidents include unprecedented flooding and deaths in parts of Germany, flooding in parts of US and an unusual heatwave across parts of north America and Canada. One of the key agreements at the meeting was on finance. Sharma has called for a plan from developed countries on how they are going to deliver the $100 billion a year in international climate finance, which has been promised since 2009 but has been delivered. Now, the amount will have to be delivered between 2020 and 2025. India said in its official statement at the G20 energy and climate joint ministerial meeting on Saturday that the target of reducing emissions to net zero by mid-century, proposed by some countries, will not be adequate in view of the fast-depleting global carbon space. It urged the G20 nations with per capita greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions above the world average to reduce the levels by 2030. According to data provided by the Climate Watch by World Resources Institute, India emits 7.1% of global emissions and has per capita emissions of about 2.47 Tco2e (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent), as compared to the global average of 6.45 tco2/per capita. Union environment minister, Bhupender Yadav said on Friday at the G20 Climate ministerial that the world should not be shifting goalposts, possibly referring to diplomatic pressure on every country to raise ambition to meet a 1.5 degree C goal."
" To stop the further acceleration of the climate crisis, the world needs to transition to clean energy sources. To realise this transition, countries world over need to direct considerable investment flows to decarbonisation activities; as per Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimates, the world needs $6.9 trillion ( ₹5.04 crore crore) annually to meet its 2030 nationally determined contribution targets alon . Given that developing countries have limited economic resources, prioritising decarbonisation efforts on the basis of impact is needed. In India, the electricity sector accounts for 40% of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the country (as of 2016) and thus presents one such decarbonisation pathway (MoEFCC 2021). Recognising this need, India has set a target of achieving 450 GW of renewable energy (RE) by 2030 (over 4.5 times the current installed capacity). However, due to the build-up of coal-based assets over the last two decades, India also has around 10% (208 GW) of the world’s installed coal capacity (MOP 2021). Though coal supplies over 70% of the total electricity in the country, these coal-based assets are a significant contributor to the total GHG emissions by the electricity sector. Under the National Electricity Plan (NEP) 2018, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has identified over 25 GW of excess coal-based capacity for retirement by 2027. However, the retirement process continues to be slow, even for the list of earlier identified plants. The slow retirement of old inefficient assets combined with low demand growth, improving RE economics, and increasing penetration has resulted in a high share of inefficient plants in the system, putting pressure on the coal assets with system-wide low utilisation (Lolla 2021; Zeniewski and Singh 2021). Currently, India’s coal assets are significantly under-utilised (53 per cent in FY21) compared to at the start of the decade (above 70% in FY11). The slower than anticipated growth of power demand and, of late, the increasing contribution of renewables drives this under-utilisation. Low utilisation also poses a risk to the financial sector—as of September 2020, 11% of Indian power sector loans were classified as non-performing assets (NPAs), and most of these were loans extended to coal-based assets. To improve the coal plant mix towards new and efficient plants and accommodate the transition from coal-based assets to RE technologies, the country can opt for early decommissioning of some excess coal capacity. The economically draining capacity, which is pollution-intensive and whose absence would not adversely affect the regional demand-supply balance are ideal for piloting this solution, as already identified by the Central Electricity Authority under the National Electricity Plan, 2018. Such a step could help prepare for decommissioning other assets that may continue to function until RE technologies become viable in line with India’s decarbonisation goals. In addition, this move could help improve utilisation rates and reduce the financial stress on the banking system by ensuring improved cash flows for coal assets. This step is also crucial because, as multiple sectors work towards decarbonisation, they will increasingly rely on electricity rather than fossil fuels. This step can also help unlock the capital in coal-based assets to finance India’s RE transition. The costs, drivers and savings of an early decommissioning As a first step to ascertain the costs associated with such a process, we looked at 130 plants (see Table 4) with 95 GW of installed capacity, representing 45 per cent of the total 208 GW of installed coal capacity in the country. In the absence of plant-level financials, we used tariff orders of the individual plants to calculate the costs associated as per the methodology discussed later. The calculations allowed us to uncover the payables towards equity and debt holders and the workforce in the face of transition. Based on the analysis, amortising the total cost associated with decommissioning would lead to an average yearly cost ₹0.37 crore/MW/year ($ 50,550/MW/year) for decommissioning a plant a year earlier than envisaged; this represents savings of around 23% over the annual capacity charges. 1. We find that decommissioning the 130 plants today would cost between ₹2.31 lakh crore ($ 32 billion) and ₹3.50 lakh crore ($ 48 billion), including payouts to promoters and debt holders. These costs, on average, are between ₹2.3 crore/MW ($ 0.33 million/MW) and ₹3.7 crore/MW ($ 0.51 million/MW). 2. Payouts to the workforce contribute another ₹57,490 crore ($ 7.8 billion) to the cost. On average, workforce-related payouts for early decommissioning add ₹0.61 crore/MW ($ 0.08 million/MW). 3. The reduced payouts towards capacity charges, especially under the cost heads of O&M (operation and maintenance) and ‘other’ charges in the event of early decommissioning, could help save ₹1.24 lakh crore ($ 17 billion) for the 130 plants. 4. On average, an annual saving of ₹0.11 crore/MW/ year ($ 15,450/MW/year) is potentially possible through early decommissioning of the sample.5 5. Decommissioning the asset today, on average, will allow a capital unlocking of equity and debt worth ₹1.3 crore/MW ($ 0.17 million/MW) and ₹2.4 crore/MW ($ 0.33 million/MW) each. Given the scale of the task at hand, multiple complexities may arise, including challenges in balancing the regional power supply and demand and adapting grid infrastructure. Thus, the decommissioning process needs to be split into multiple stages to address these technical constraints and to optimise the viability of decommissioning financially. Therefore, in addition to a plant-level economic assessment of each of the 130 units, we have categorised them based on age, variable costs of power, station heat rate, etc., to understand the relationship of cost to these parameters. These benchmarks could help establish the most financially prudent path to early decommissioning among several different pathways, including those not analysed in the report. Based on the criteria of age (one of the preferred criteria for decommissioning coal assets the world over), the assessments produced the following significant findings. For plants above 25 years of age, the assumed remaining life of the contract is five years. We estimate the average annual cost of decommissioning (including debt, equity, and workforce-related payouts) for these plants to be ₹0.2 crore/MW/year ($ 6,320/MW/year). For the 47 plants that meet these criteria, with an aggregate capacity of 35 GW and an average age of 34 years, it would cost ₹21,474 crore ($ 2.9 billion) to pay off the debt and equity holders; workforce payouts would contribute another ₹11,700 crore ($ 1.6 billion). It would cost a total of ₹33,170 crore ($ 4.5 billion) to decommission these plants early and pay the stakeholders for the five-year worth of contract value.6 However, the avoided portion of the annual payouts worth ₹7,550 crore to these assets, primarily operations and maintenance, and working capital amount to ₹37,750 crore ($ 5.2 billion). That is an early decommissioning could be paid for itself over the next five to six years. Interestingly, there is significant scope to reduce high equity-related payouts worth 29% of the total cost of decommissioning the 95 GW capacity analysed. As is visible in Germany’s latest rounds of auctions to decommission its coal assets provide evidence of how a law on phasing out coal, coal-based generation, and the auction mechanism can help reduce the costs associated with decommissioning— particularly the payouts due to equity holders—to 40% of the auction caps (Wehrmann 2020). For its next steps, India would need to ascertain how to remove coal assets from the grid through decommissioning, mothballing, or repurposing for storage or RE. All these and other options need careful assessment to choose the right option viable for different sets of plants. Another essential step in the process is mapping the potential fallouts, significantly impacting the workforce, and building strategies to make the transition just for all the concerned stakeholders. Ensuring a smooth transition, especially for the people in the workforce, a mix of strategies would be needed, including voluntary retirement schemes (as used in nationalised banks in India when the core banking solution was introduced in the 1900’s) and retraining and absorbing workers into alternative jobs. Adequate compensation must be paid to coal mine owners and workers for the early closure of existing contracts to supply coal. This is important since electricity generation is one of the most significant drivers of coal demand in India and directly employs close to 5 lakh people (IEA 2020). However, the process would need further deliberations as residents of over 50 districts, across 13 states in India are reliant to a varying degree on the coal-based activities to earn a livelihood and transition will impact that (Sandeep Pai and Hishman Zerrefi 2021). Otherwise, by continuously delaying the process, the country may be stuck with excess coal capacity that would continue hurting financiers as has been the case with the power sector’s NPAs, which may ultimately delay RE growth by locking in the much-needed capital. Based on the economics of the decision, we found that decommissioning may not be a viable option for most of the new plants but make sense for a number of the older plants above 20 years, as shown later in the analysis. The age, when combined with the variable cost factor, we found that around 16 GW of the 95GW could be feasibly retired at almost 40% of the yearly costs at ₹0.15 crore/MW/year ($ 19,960 / MW/year) vs ₹0.37 crore/MW/year ($ 50,550/MW/ year) of the sample analysed. Decommissioning these plants would be a cost-efficient way of decarbonising the power sector as the payouts are lesser, and discoms can save on the high variable costs associated with purchasing power from these generators.

" Heatwaves that obliterate temperature records as in western Canada last month and Siberia last year are caused by the rapid pace, rather than the amount, of global warming, researchers said Monday. The findings, reported in Nature Climate Change, suggest that humanity is likely to see a lot more deadly scorchers in the coming decades. ""Because we are in a period of very rapid warming, we need to prepare for more heat events that shatter previous records by large margins,"" head author Erich Fischer, a senior scientist at ETH Zurich and a lead author of the UN climate science assessment currently under review, told AFP. The heatwave that ravaged British Columbia saw temperatures hit 49.6 degrees Celsius (121 Fahrenheit), more than five degrees above the hottest day recorded in Canada up to that point. Current rates of warming -- about 0.2 degrees Celsius per decades -- are likely to continue for at least another 10 to 20 years no matter how quickly humanity reduces the carbon pollution that drives global heating, the study warns. But efforts to curb greenhouse gases over the next decade will pay off later. ""The future probability of record-shattering extremes depends on the emissions pathway that gets us to a given level of warming,"" Fischer said. Up to now, research on how global warming will affect heatwaves has focused mostly on how much temperatures have risen compared to some reference period rather than on how quickly. That is, of course, critically important, and the science has shown without a doubt that a warmer world will produce more and hotter heatwaves. But not taking into account how quickly temperatures rise fails to capture a key part of the picture. Climate on steroids ""Without climate change, one would expect record temperatures to become rarer the longer we measure,"" Fischer explained. Likewise, if average global temperatures stabilise -- at, say, 1.5 degrees Celsius above mid-19th century levels, the aspirational target of the Paris Agreement -- dramatic new records would progressively become less frequent. Fischer compares it to track and field, where the longer a discipline exists, the harder it is top a world record. The long and high jump records, for example, have stood for decades, or are only ever surpassed by a centimetre or two. But if athletes start taking performance-enhancing drugs, as happened in US baseball during the late 1990s, records are suddenly broken often and by a lot. ""The climate currently behaves like an athlete on steroids,"" Fischer said. At current rates of greenhouse gas emissions, the world is on track to continue warming at current rates to more than 3C by 2100. ""This is a very important study,"" commented Tim Palmer, a research professor at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the findings. But climate models with far higher resolution -- like a camera with 64 mega-pixels rather than 16 -- are needed to simulate the monster heatwaves observed the world over the last 20 years. ""This new study shines a valuable spotlight on the high potential for record-shattering extremes,"" including the kind of extreme rainfall that ravaged Germany and China earlier this month, noted Rowan Sutton, a professor at the University of Reading's National Centre for Atmospheric Science, in Britain."
" Delhi is among the most polluted cities in the world (IQ Air 2021). In 2019 alone, air pollution caused over 17,000 premature deaths and an economic loss of $1,207 in the national Capital (Pandey et al. 2021). With regards to air quality, 2020 was an aberration. The pandemic-induced lockdown measures provided temporary respite from the year-round poor air quality. Despite the lockdown, Delhi’s annual average PM2.5 in 2020 was more than two times its permissible limit Barring a few days in April and May, Delhi experienced National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) compliant air quality on most days during the lockdown. Yet, the annual average PM2.5 concentration in 2020 was 93 µg/m3, which is more than twice the permissible limit for PM2.5 in India. Despite low activity levels for close to eight months (March to November) in 2020, Delhi residents were exposed to NAAQS non-compliant air for more than half of the year. Winters saw poor quality despite proactive measures by the government While the NAAQS non-compliant air quality in Delhi is not a new phenomenon, the winter of 2020 witnessed proactive measures from the State government in the wake of Covid-19 and evidence pointing at the association between high air pollution and Covid mortality (Petroni et al. 2020; Cole, Ozgen, and Strobl 2020; Wu et al. 2020). This includes the Yuddh Pradushan Ke Virudh (war against pollution) campaign and a seven-point action plan to combat air pollution in Delhi which listed measures ranging from combating dust and mitigating hotspots to a mobile application called Green Delhi for complaints and a ‘war room’ for monitoring air pollution control activities (PTI 2020). Similar to 2019, the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), also came into force on October 15, 2020 and the Environmental Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) oversaw its implementation until the announcement of its dissolution on October 28, 2020 (Koshy 2020; EPCA 2020). However, despite these measures, the PM2.5 levels remained almost three times higher than the NAAQS on an average between October 2020 and January 2021. We also observe that PM2.5 levels in winter 2020 were higher than those in 2019. To explain this end, we analyse meteorological parameters, source activity levels, and contributions to establish primary drivers of pollution during different phases of the winter season. Through this brief, we intend to help the Delhi government, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) to identify priority areas of intervention for the year 2021. We summarise key highlights as follows. Air quality in winter 2020 was worse than winter 2019. Delhi observed 92 severe and very poor air quality days in the winter of 2020 compared to 80 such days in 2019. Compared to an average PM2.5 concentration of 161 μg/m3 in 2019, between October and November 2020, this value was 172 μg/m3. It further shot up to an average level of 192 μg/m3 in the period between December 2020 to January 2021 compared to 178 μg/m3 during the same period previous year. Contributions from stubble burning and household emissions from cooking and space heating were significant fractions of the pollution pie. Modelled source contribution estimates of particulate matter (PM2.5) by UrbanEmissions suggest that relative contribution from farm fires was the highest (~30%) in the period between October 15 and November 15, 2020. We find that compared to the stubble burning period in 2019, a longer harvesting season in 2020 led to a significant increase in the number of fires. In the following months, contribution from household emissions (including domestic cooking, space heating, water heating, and lighting) primarily drove poor air quality in Delhi. It is worth highlighting that these values are modelled estimates and are subject to the sector-specific assumptions used in the model. Calmer winds in October and November amplified the impact of farm fires on Delhi’s air quality The stubble burning phase (October 15 to November 15) in 2020 experienced 172 hours (70% higher) of calm and light winds (<5 km/h) compared to 101 hours in 2019. Winds predominantly from the north-west direction facilitated the transport of smoke emanating from farm fires and calm winds in Delhi further intensified its adverse impact on air quality. Interestingly, for brief periods in the season, even when high fire counts were reported in Punjab and Haryana, Delhi’s air quality was not affected due to favourable meteorological conditions (easterly and southerly winds) (Figure ES3). Lowered activity levels at the start of winter due to lockdown bounced back to the previous year’s levels as the winter progressed While Delhi’s average PM2.5 concentration during the stubble-burning period (October’20 and November’20) was 172 µg/m3 , it increased to 192 µg/m3 during peak winter (December’20 and January’21). The higher PM2.5 levels in December 2020 and January 2021 were primarily caused by locally-emitted pollutants and added burden of household emissions from space heating. Activity levels were low at the start of the season, but most activities, including vehicular traffic and power generation, bounced back to the previous year’s levels (proxied by indicators such as congestion and electricity generation levels in Figures ES4 and ES5) as the season progressed. Delhi needs a dedicated air quality forecasting cell to facilitate roll out of preventive measures. We attribute the brief periods of moderate air quality during winter 2020 largely to favourable meteorological conditions. It is evident that adverse meteorological conditions in Delhi intensified the impact of local and regional emissions on Delhi’s air quality. While meteorological conditions cannot be controlled, sustained air quality gains can be realised only by steeper emission cuts across sectors. Delhi has in place a publicly available air quality forecast system provided by UrbanEmissions for over five years. The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), under the aegis of ministry of earth sciences (MoES), has also built an official air quality warning system for Delhi (PIB 2018). However, none of these forecasts were actively used to take pre-emptive measures to reduce emission loads from anthropogenic activities. Some countries roll out emergency measures in response to air quality forecasts and not after air quality actually dips to dangerous levels. For instance, Beijing’s ministry of ecology and environment issues a red alert if the daily mean citywide air quality index (AQI) is forecasted to be greater than 200 for four days (96 hours) or more; greater than 300 for two days (48 hours) or more; or greater than 500. In contrast, the Delhi government issues orders to execute emergency measures under GRAP ex-post, that is, after air quality concentrations reach a certain threatening level. Responsive measures cannot prevent the occurrence of high pollution episodes. Further, adding relative source contributions to air quality forecasts, similar to the way UrbanEmissions issues forecasts, can help identify the primary contributors during a particular episode. Integrating such forecasts with a decision support system would enable the local regulatory agencies to implement on-demand emission control interventions targeting prominent sources during forecasted high-pollution episodes. GRAP presents the state government with an opportunity to constitute an air quality forecasting cell that can advise the government to take necessary measures to prevent severe air quality episodes in the capital city. We recommend that going forward, the Delhi government, the CPCB, and the DPCC use the air quality forecasts not only to issue public health warnings but also for taking pre-emptive actions in the national capital. We must move from a system that enforces the GRAP as an ex-post measure to one that prevents the occurrence of high pollution episodes through pre-emptive emission control measures.

" Between April 2020 and March this year, India witnessed 18.5 million lightning strikes, marking a significant 34% increase in 13.8 million bolts from the blue in a similar period the previous year, a study by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) and Down to Earth found. Laying stress on the trend that the number and frequency of lightning strikes have increased globally, the environment think-tank attempted to find out their link with climate change and unchecked urbanisation. As many as 1,697 people were killed after they were struck by lightning between March last year and April this year. Experts are of the view that the increase in incidents of lightning strikes are owing to climate change. “There is growing scientific evidence that climate change may be sparking more lightning across the world. Rapid urbanisation and population growth have guaranteed an intensification of human exposure to lightning hazards,” says Down To Earth managing editor Richard Mahapatra. ALSO READ | Climate crisis reason behind increase in lightning strikes In recent months states such as West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Puducherry have seen a sudden spurt in incidents of lightning strikes. Punjab has seen an exponential 331% annual rise in such incidents while in Bihar — where 401 people lost their lives to lightning strikes during the year — recodes a 168% rise. National Disaster Management Authority listed thunderstorms accompanied by lightning strikes (usually in the pre-monsoon and monsoon months) are the single-largest killers among natural disasters in India. A study conducted by California University in 2015 projected that a rise in average global temperatures by 1ºC would increase the frequency of lightning by at least 12%. A soon-to-be-published paper in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics also cautioned that the frequency of lightning strikes in India are expected to increase by 10% to 25% every year and could grow by 50% by the turn of the century. Experts have found that a foreboding dimension of the rise in incidents of lightning strikes is their link to growing forest fires. “Scientists from the Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University in Srinagar, and the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, have studied the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in different weather conditions in the central Himalayan region. They have found a five-time higher concentration of CCN in the atmosphere during forest fires as against during rains. In May 2021, researchers in Australia linked excess CCN to the increased number of lightning strikes during the 2019-20 Australia forest fires,” says Kiran Pandey, programme director of CSE’s environmental resources unit. However, India has made some progress to mitigate the adverse effects of lightning strikes. The rise in fatalities prompted the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to start lightning forecasts from April 1, 2019. Lightning India Resilient Campaign (LRIC), a joint initiative of several bodies such as Climate Resilient Observing-Systems Promotion Council (CROPC), National Disaster Management Authority, IMD, Union ministry of earth sciences and others aims to reduce the number of deaths due to lightning strikes to less than 1,200 a year by 2022. A senior reporter with Down to Earth, Akshit Sangomla said the LRIC campaign helped bring down lightning-related deaths by more than 60% within two years of its launch. “Dedicated efforts by governments of states like Andhra Pradesh and Odisha have led to a 70% reduction in fatalities,” Sangomla added. CSE’ Kiran Pandey said the recorded incidents of lightning revealed that the seasonality of bolt is different each state, and laid stress that the lightning risk management programme is customised for each state according to their seasonality, frequency of occurrence and intensity. “States should undertake lightning micro-zonation for the regions inside their boundaries, depending on their geography, to handle the disaster and death risks better. These are LRIC’s recommendations and they make a lot of sense,” says Pandey.

" Two Nasa instruments have tracked the record-shattering temperatures in the Pacific Northwest and US Southwest amid reports of another heat wave developing this weekend which is set to bake western US and Canada. Nasa’s Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) aboard the Aqua satellite captured the progression of the heat dome during an unprecedented heat wave across the southwestern US from July 1 to July 12. In the seven-second clip shared by Nasa, the animation shows surface air temperature anomalies. The hottest areas, which experienced surface air temperatures of more than 5.6 degrees Celsius above average, are shown in pink. Another Nasa instrument, ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS), captured ground surface temperature data over California.   The image captured by ECOSTRESS shows areas in red that surpassed 30 degrees Celsius on July 8, well above average ground surface temperatures for the area. The next day, Death Valley, a desert valley in Eastern California, recorded a high air temperature of 54.44 degrees Celsius, falling just a few degrees short of the official all-time surface air temperature record of 56.67 degrees Celsius in 1913. Scientists have warned that the unprecedented heat wave is not possible without the impact of climate change. The recent heat wave claimed hundreds of lives in Pacific Northwest and British Columbia. Meanwhile, reports have emerged that another heat wave is building up during the weekend and will reach its peak on Monday. The heat wave will not be as extreme as the earlier one, but it will be unusually hot, according to The Washington Post. The US national weather service has predicted high temperatures throughout the Northern Plains and into parts of northern and central Minnesota."

" More than 1,000 people were missing in flood-hit regions of Germany and Belgium on Friday, where waters were still rising with the death toll already well over 100 and communications in some areas cut. Entire communities lay in ruins after swollen rivers swept through towns and villages in the western German states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate, Belgium as well as the Netherlands. In Germany alone, at least 103 people have died in what is the country’s worst mass loss of life in years. Twelve of the dead were residents of a home for disabled people in Sinzig to the south of Cologne who were surprised by the flashfloods at night. The death toll is expected to rise further as more houses collapsed, while in Belgium, media said at least 14 had died. Some 114,000 households in Germany were without power on Friday and mobile phone networks had collapsed in some flooded regions, which meant that family and friends were unable to track down their loved ones. In Rhineland-Palatinate, around 1,300 people were reported missing in the Ahrweiler district south of Cologne, the district government said. Further north, in Erftstadt, several houses collapsed on Friday, and authorities feared casualties. Roads around the town were impassable after being washed away by the floods. Rescue crews tried to reach residents by boat and had to communicate via walkie-talkie. The German military has deployed over 700 soldiers to support rescue efforts. Authorities worried that further dams could overflow, spilling uncontrolled floods."
       
" Russian president Vladimir Putin, notorious for his scepticism about global warming, has now said that climate change is a priority and vowed to work along with the United States to battle increasing global temperatures, news agency AFP reported on Thursday. The development comes amid a record-breaking heatwave in Russia during June which experts say could lead to the hottest summer that the country has experienced in more than a century.  Moscow bakes in soaring temperatures.

The meteorological service says Russia could see its hottest summer in 120 years after a record-breaking heatwave in June.

" A new study conducted by space agency National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) has found a 'wobble' in Moon's orbit along with rising sea levels will lead to devastating floods in the 2030s. Referring to the natural calamity as 'nuisance floods', the study said the events would become more frequent and erratic and the US coastline will majorly face the brunt of it. Regarding the impact of the Moon on flooding on Earth, the study's lead author Phil Thompson, an assistant professor at the University of Hawaii, said that the 'wobble' in the Moon's orbit takes 18.6 years to complete. Here’s all we need to know about the Moon’s wobble: - While the ‘wobble’ has always been there, what makes it dangerous is that it will combine with the rising sea levels due to the planet's warming, said Thompson.  - This cycle is expected to occur in mid-2030s, and coupled with the rising sea level, could lead to more such devastating floods. - According to the Nasa’s website, when the Moon makes its elliptical orbit, its velocity varies and alters causing our perspective of the ""light side"" to appear at slightly different angles. This is what it calls the Moon’s wobble or that is how it appears to our eyes. - Nasa says that while a casual glance skyward would not reveal this, when a full month of lunar views gets compressed into 12 seconds, it is impossible to miss."
" At least 74 people have been killed in lightning strikes in the past 24 hours in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh. Of these, 11 are visitors who were killed on Sunday when lightning struck them at Amer Fort near Jaipur. The numbers may seem high but should not surprise anyone. Thunderstorms accompanied by lightning strikes (usually in the pre-monsoon and monsoon months) are the single-largest killers among natural disasters (extreme weather events) in India, according to National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). Lightning strikes have killed at least 2,000 people every year in India since 2004, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said last month in an awareness workshop on lightning strikes. In 2019, there were 2,876 deaths due to lightning, compared to fewer than 1,500 on an average, annually, between 1968 and 2004. There was a brief period of three to four years in between when lightning strikes killed more than 1,500 people, but the larger trend held. The disaster management division of ministry of home affairs is yet to update the data on lightning deaths for 2020. According to a paper published in Elsevier journal, Weather and Climate Extremes by the ministry of earth sciences titled “An assessment of long-term changes in mortalities due to extreme weather events in India: A study of 50 years’ data, 1970–2019”, the mortality rate of tropical cyclones reduced by 94% over a 20 year period, whereas that for heatwaves and lightning, increased by 62.2% and 52.8%, respectively. Monsoon break created conditions for strikes Normally, lightning strikes are high in frequency during the pre-monsoon season, and when the monsoon is about to make an onset over Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and neighbouring states. This is the time when moisture levels increase, and the surface temperature is high, creating favourable conditions for development of thunder clouds. This year, however, there have been massive lightning strikes and associated casualty in mid-July, mainly due to the long monsoon “break” when surface temperatures were very high in the absence of rain. “There has been around a 10-day break in monsoon. There has been significant surface heating during this period. As the monsoon is reviving, moisture levels have also increased. This is the most favourable condition for development of thunder clouds and collision of ice particles which leads to charging and lightning strikes,” said SD Pawar, project director, Thunderstorm Dynamics, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune. Thunder clouds require heat and moisture to form. They are also required to be deep, around nine to 10 kilometres for collision of ice particles to take place. And that’s what is happening now. Why are we seeing a spike in recent years? According to Pawar, the spike in lightning strikes can certainly be linked to the climate crisis. “Both surface temperature and moisture levels have increased significantly in recent years. Urbanisation leading to loss of tree cover also contributes to the rise in surface temperature. We think the two have mainly contributed to rise in incidence of lightning. The rise in deaths can be because more people are outdoors and possibly exposed to lightning in recent years,” he said. Lightning mortalities are only going to increase in coming years. “Climate projections indicate that temperature and moisture will increase further in the future,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM). How can deaths be prevented?"
" A wildfire raging uncontrollably across southern Oregon has knocked out three electrical lines so critical to the stability of grids in the western U.S. that California has warned of rotating blackouts and Nevada faced a power emergency. The fast-moving Bootleg fire crippled a key transmission system known as the California Oregon Intertie that the Golden State has depended on for years for electricity imports. Making matters worse: The takedown of the intertie has had a knock-on effect on another key import hub known as the Pacific DC Intertie that brings in electricity from the Pacific Northwest, California’s grid operator said in a media briefing Saturday. In all, California has lost 5,500 megawatts of power-import capacity -- enough to light up roughly 4.13 million homes. After days of pushing state residents to conserve energy with the risk of rolling blackouts, the grid operator said conditions are expected to be stable with no flex alert planned Sunday -- for now. The transmission lines knocked out by the Bootleg fire are still out of service, affecting power supplies. The fact that a single wildfire has brought America’s most populous and affluent state to the brink of blackouts is among the most powerful demonstrations yet of how vulnerable the world’s power grids have become to the effects of climate change. Extreme heat, drought and dry conditions globally have shrunk hydropower reserves, driven up electricity demand to record levels and touched off some of the worst wildfire seasons in modern history. Climate change is “forcing us to do things we never imagined” at this time of the year, said Elliot Mainzer, who took over as chief executive officer of grid manager California Independent System Operator nine months ago. The agency is “anticipating what could be a very long and hot summer,” he said. California has emerged as the epicenter of climate disasters in the U.S. Wildfires burned an unprecedented 4.3 million acres across the state last year, killing 33 people and scorching nearly 10,500 structures. In August, California suffered its first rolling blackouts since the U.S. West energy crisis two decades ago because of extremely hot weather. And in a foreshadowing of what was to come: Days before this year’s summer officially began, high temperatures forced the California ISO to make an unusually early call for conservation, allowing the region to duck another round of rotating outages. “Bottom line is we took everything we learned from last summer, and we still came into this summer thinking our issues were going to primarily be associated with August and September,” Mainzer said, but “we had the first major heat wave four days before the official beginning of summer.” On Friday evening, the grid operator took the rare step of ordering a Stage 2 emergency -- one step away from rotating blackouts -- to cope with the loss of import capacity. Energy conservation helped the state avert a crisis. But as temperatures rose yet again and supplies fell off the grid Saturday, Mainzer said, “We’re going to need more. Honestly, I think we are going to need more response than we saw last night.” The grid operator issued an all-clear at about 9 p.m. local time Saturday. Earlier in the day, Governor Gavin Newsom also signed an order to free up more energy capacity to help alleviate the supply crunch. California wasn’t the only state facing power woes. Nevada’s power system was among those in the region that also faced emergency levels on Friday evening, said Mark Rothleder, California’s ISO’s chief operating officer. On top of managing California’s grid, the agency serves as a reliability coordinator and is responsible for monitoring conditions across the western region. Nevada utility NV Energy Inc. said it wasn’t forced to resort to blackouts, but the company was calling for customers to conserve over the weekend. Exactly when the Bootleg fire would subside enough to re-energize the California Oregon Intertie remains to be seen. Mainzer said it was possible the lines would return to service on Sunday at midnight local time, but the grid operator was operating under the assumption that the system would remain down. The Bootleg fire had burned through 76,897 acres of southern Oregon and zero percent of it was contained as of Saturday afternoon, forcing evacuations in Klamath County and shutting sections of a national forest, according to an update from the U.S. Fire Service. Meanwhile, the agency said, it has no timeline available for the restart of the intertie lines."
" Summer sea ice loss in the Kara Sea region of the Arctic may be triggering extreme monsoon rainfall events in central India in the month of September, a new paper has suggested. The research, led by the National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research under the ministry of earth sciences, has found that the frequency of extreme rainfall events (daily rainfall >150 mm) in central India in September displayed a consistently increasing trend with declining summer sea ice extent during the Early Twentieth Century Warming (ETCW, 1920–1940) period and recent warming since the 1980s. The trend was found to be stronger in the recent warming period after the 1980s, the paper, ‘A possible relation between Arctic sea ice and late season Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall extremes’, said. Since the beginning of the satellite records in 1979, the Arctic Sea Ice Extent (SIE) has been declining at a rate of about 4.4% per decade in annual mean, the paper published in the journal Nature on June 22 said. While it is still unclear if this rapid sea ice decline can influence extreme weather events in the tropics, or the extreme rainfall events during monsoon in India, scientists from NCPOR have proposed that it may be causing a high-pressure area over Northwest Europe. The scientists have found that extreme rainfall events in late monsoon can be induced by the sea ice decline. The authors said that the upper level atmospheric circulation changes due to Arctic sea ice loss and very warm sea surface temperatures over the Arabian Sea could together contribute to increase in extreme monsoon rain in central India, particularly in the month of September. “As the sea ice reduces in the Barents-Kara Sea region of the Arctic Ocean, it allows more convection and upward air motion over the open ocean during summer. This air then descends at a further south location over northwest Europe and intensifies a deep anticyclonic atmospheric circulation. The associated meandering of the jet stream also contributes to it. This abnormal upper atmospheric disturbance is then further propagated towards subtropical Asia extending over the Indian landmass. The upper-level atmospheric circulation change along with an above-normal Arabian Sea surface temperature help in enhanced convection and moisture supply - resulting in extreme rainfall events during August-September,” said Sourav Chatterjee, lead author from NCPOR. In 2015, a paper by meteorologist TN Krishnamurti of Florida State University, proposed that the heat released in the atmosphere during extreme rainfall events over northwest India ultimately travels to the Canadian Arctic region causing significant sea ice loss in the Arctic. The effects of Arctic Sea ice changes on the mid-latitudes are still debated but it is often proposed that increase in mid-latitude extreme weather events is associated with Arctic Amplification induced loss in sea ice. Over the past 30 years, the Arctic has warmed at twice the rate as the entire globe — this phenomenon is known as Arctic Amplification, according to the US’s National Snow and Ice Data Center. “We started by looking at over 100 years of observational records of summer monsoon rainfall and sea ice in the Arctic. During the two episodes of rapid sea ice decline in the Arctic Ocean (1920-1940 and 1980-present) the frequency of extreme rainfall events consistently increase. This motivated us to look at the relationship between extreme rainfall and sea ice in the Arctic. Earlier studies had shown the potential mid-latitude influences on the monsoon. We further investigated the possible impact of sea ice loss in this mid-latitude influence on the monsoon extremes,” Chatterjee said, underlining that impacts of such atmospheric circulation changes are most prominent over the west and central India, and parts of the west coast. “In summary, our results indicate since the 1980s, rapidly declining summer sea ice extent in the Kara Sea region exhibits a more robust relationship with the frequency of Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall extremes, compared to mean ISMR intensity; extreme precipitation events in central India during the late phase of ISMR season can be explained by the combined effect of the upper atmospheric circulation anomalies resulting from reduced sea ice extent and low-level circulation anomalies over west-central India supported by warm sea surface temperature anomalies in the north-western Arabian Sea,” the paper said."
" Antarctica logged temperatures up to 18.3 degrees Celsius (64.9 degrees Fahrenheit), a new maximum temperature record for the region, on February 6 earlier this year, the United Nations World Meteorological Organization (UN WMO) has confirmed. With this, Antarctica has now become one of the fastest-warming regions in the world -- registering a rise of almost three degrees Celsius in the last 50 years, WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas said on Thursday. Also Read | Antarctica closing in on a tipping point if emissions aren’t curbed: Scientists According to the UN agency, the high temperatures in Antarctica are a result of a large high-pressure system creating ""fohn conditions"", which are downslope winds creating significant surface warming. This, in turn, resulted in local warming both at the Esperanza station and at Seymour Island. Past scenarios such as this had also produced conditions conducive for similar record temperatures, an official release stated. The earlier record temperature for the Antarctic continent, according to the WMO, was 17.5 degrees Celsius (63.5 degrees Fahrenheit) -- recorded on March 24, 2015, at the Esperanza Research Station. The new record of 18.3 degrees Celsius, established earlier this year, was also logged at the same station in Argentina, according to a press release issued by the UN agency. ""The Antarctic Peninsula is among the fastest-warming regions of the planet, almost 3°C over the last 50 years. This new temperature record is therefore consistent with the climate change we are observing. WMO is working in partnership with the Antarctic Treaty System to help conserve this pristine continent,"" said Professor Taalas. Also Read | Arctic is warming faster than other parts of the world. Here's why The record was established after an extensive review conducted by the WMO's Weather and Climate Extremes Archive on the weather situation in the Antarctica peninsula. It, however, debunked reports suggesting that the Antarctic region crossed 20.7 degrees Celsius (69.3 degrees Fahrenheit) on February 9 last year. The committee also examined the two observations' instrumental setups. The examination of the data and metadata of the Esperanza station observation, operated by Argentina's national meteorological service (Servicio Meteorologico Nacional, SMN) revealed no major concerns.

" Climate change poses unprecedented challenges to human-made and natural ecosystems as well as to anthropocentric and economic activities. The most obvious evidence, arguably, is the surge in the frequency of extreme events. Extreme weather events resulting from climate change led to 495,000 human deaths across the world in 1999–2018. Further, more than 12,000 extreme weather events led to losses worth USD 3.54 trillion (measured in terms of purchasing power parity or PPP) during this period. Against this backdrop of changing climate, the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration, and pattern of weather and climate events are also changing, leading to unprecedented climate extremes (Zhai et al. 2018). According to the Climate Risk Index, 2018, India jumped nine places in climate vulnerability rankings and was ranked the fifth-most climate-vulnerable country in the world (German Watch, 2018). Storms are escalating into cyclones, droughts are affecting more than half of the country, and floods of an unprecedented scale are causing catastrophic damage. There is no denying that the climate is changing – and fast. Global, regional, national, and subnational climate actions are geared toward limiting any further increase in the earth’s temperature to 2 °C. However, we must also consider the consequences of this “target” temperature increase, given that the current trends in extreme events are the result of a 0.6 °C rise in the last 100 years (IMD 2019). This report presents a micro-level hazard assessment of climate extremes in India. Through geospatial, temporal analysis, we provide a detailed assessment of the impact of extreme events at a district level. We use the pentad decadal analysis of extreme events in India (1970–2019) to identify district hotspots and climate change landscape for extreme events (see Figure ES1). The study argues that comprehensive risk assessments at the localised level are the need of the hour and should be undertaken for all districts in India. This study looks at the combined risk of hydro-met disasters and their compounded impacts. As per our analysis, the Indian subcontinent has witnessed more than 478 extreme events since 1970 and an acceleration in their frequency after 2005. This study provides an micro-level hazard assessment for India at a historical timescale. According to our analysis, India experienced an exponential increase in extreme events during the period 1970–2019, with a marked acceleration in 2000–2019. We considered 2005 the reference year for the pentad decadal analysis primarily because of the availability of attribute base maps for 2005, which we procured from ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation). However, this study focuses on only hydro-met disasters due to gaps in the data on other phenomena. We developed the district-level roster of extreme events for 1970–2019 in line with Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) criteria and further updated it using data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Press Information Bureau (PIB), and the Ministry of Agriculture. Our analysis found that floods and droughts have become increasingly common in many regions across various climatic zones in India. We infer that in the post-2005 period, at least 55 or more districts in India witnessed extreme flood events year-on-year (≈ 97.51 million people are exposed to extreme flood events in India annually). Increased precipitation levels are triggering a surge in extreme flood events, thereby causing severe damage to infrastructure and disrupting the socioeconomic fabric by causing extensive loss and damage to lives, livelihood and property. Similarly, 79 districts witnessed extreme drought events year-on-year (≈ 140.06 million people are exposed to extreme drought events), and 24 districts witnessed extreme cyclone events yearly (≈ 42.50 million people were exposed to storm surges, intense cyclones, and associated events). In the period 1970–2005, there were 250 extreme events; the post-2005 period witnessed 310 extreme and its associated events (which includes slow onset events like heat waves and cold waves). Frequent floods and droughts pose a severe challenge to food and water security in India. The empirical evidence generated from our analyses coincides with the weakening of monsoons due to rising micro-temperatures. This further can be validated by the fact that states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh saw severe water scarcity during 2015 due to record-breaking temperatures during summer and weakening monsoons. We find that the pattern of extreme events is changing across some regions (districts) in India – some drought-prone districts are becoming flood-prone and vice versa. Rajkot, Surendranagar, Ajmer, Jodhpur, and Aurangabad, among others, are a few districts where we observed a shifting trend from floods to drought. A few districts in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, and Tamil Nadu observed the simultaneous occurrence of drought and floods. The trends are alarming and demand a comprehensive risk assessment at the local level, which requires a grid-level climatological analysis to identify the compounded impacts. Our analysis reveals that microclimatic1 zones are shifting across various regions (districts) in India. The microclimate zones, categorised according to the Köppen-Geiger classification, are shifting due to climate change. It is important to note that a shift in microclimate zones may lead to severe disruptions across sectors. For instance, every 2°C rise in annual mean temperature will reduce agricultural productivity by 15–20 per cent. Flood- and cyclone- prone districts fall under the category Cwa (monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate), and drought-prone districts under Bsh (hot semi-arid climate). The flood-based climatic zones are shifting towards Aw tropical, which is characterised by its dry season, thus validating empirically that flood-prone areas are becoming drought-prone. On the one hand, cyclone hot spots are changing from Cwa to Aw tropical climatic zones; on the other, the urban heat island (UHI) effect and increase in sea level are pushing cyclonic disturbances towards warmer regions, as is evident from the climate zone shift. Drought events are becoming more intense, and empirical evidence from the analysis suggests that southern, western, and some parts of central India are becoming increasingly prone to drought. While the frequency and intensity of extreme events are increasing, we are left with less than a decade to adhere to the Sendai Framework; course correction and policy implementation need to have a razor-sharp focus on curtailing the compounded impacts of climate change. Principles of risk assessment must form the core of India’s strategy to build resilience. While actions at the global, national, and subnational levels are targeting a well below 2°C limit, it is imperative to outline the chronic challenges that these extreme events pose, especially to the vulnerable sections and sectors. Extreme events are devastating since they are non-linear and disrupt natural and human-made ecosystems. Our analysis suggests some key recommendations that can trigger efforts towards a resilient pathway. Some of them are developing a comprehensive climate risk atlas, mainstreaming climate risk assessments at all levels across sectors; bridging financing gaps through innovative risk financing instruments; and enhancing resilience and adaptive capacity, among others. It is time to rethink and reorient our approach to mitigate disaster risks and prepare better for the impending climate uncertainties. (The article has been authored by Abinash Mohanty)"
" The severity of the February 7 glacial overflow that triggered a flash flood and swept away two hydroelectric plants in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district can be attributed to the “unfortunate location” of the power projects downstream, the effect of climate crisis, and the topography of the mountain, according to a study authored by 50 scientists. The paper, published in the journal Science on June 10, underscored the risks of rapid expansion of hydropower projects in unstable regions that are already affected by global warming, which leads to the melting of glacial ice — an issue several environmentalists have repeatedly pointed out before and after the February disaster. A glacial breach in the upper reaches of the Himalayas on February 7 and led to a flash flood that swept away the Rishiganga hydel dam project and the National Thermal Power Corporations’s Tapovan Vishnugad project — killing over 200 people, mostly workers at the two sites. Researchers found that the height of the overflow, at 5,500m above sea level, provided ample gravitational energy while the rock and ice ratio resulted in near-complete melting of the ice, making the flow of the debris faster and easier downstream. “The unfortunate location of multiple hydropower plants” in the direct path of the flow of the debris and water was the third reason for the severity of the flash flood, the paper said. “The disaster indicates that the long-term sustainability of planned hydroelectric power projects must account for both current and future social and environmental conditions while mitigating risks to infrastructure, personnel, and downstream communities,” said the study based on research led by the geoscience department of the University of Calgary (Canada). Researchers noted that a majority of the casualties, 190 out of 204, were workers of the two plants who had little to no warning. “This leads us to question what could have happened if a warning system had been installed. We estimate that a suitably designed early warning system might have allowed for 6 to 10 min of warning before the arrival of the debris flow at the Tapovan project...,” the study said, adding that a new flood warning system has since been installed near Raini, where the impact was felt. Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar on March 15 said that the 7 under-construction hydel plants along the Ganga will be allowed to go ahead, but no new project will be given authorisation in the ecologically sensitive region. The Centre’s stand will be communicated to the Supreme Court, which is hearing on the issue, said a senior ministry official, on the condition of anonymity. Reseachers also warned of more such disasters in sensitive areas such as the Himalayas as the impact of global warming is increasingly felt. “The Chamoli event may be seen in the context of a change in geomorphological sensitivity and might therefore be seen as a precursor for an increase in such events as climate warming proceeds,” the paper said. Experts and activists agree. “We also conducted research on the February 7 disaster... It demonstrated very clearly that the barrages of Rishi Ganga and Tapovan hydropower projects acted as force amplifiers for debris...The Ravi Chopra committee have argued again and again that hydropower projects in the paraglacial zone above 2,000 m height obstruct river flow and are dangerous,” said Navin Juyal, a retired geologist at the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad. “...To save investments in a few hydropower projects are we willing to lose more lives and destroy the river? I don’t understand their stand. If another such disaster happens in monsoon, we have had it,” said Mallika Bhanot, member of Ganga Ahvaan, an Uttarakhand-based NGO."
" British climate activist Gail Bradbrook, the co-founder of the Extinction Rebellion group, was arrested at home on Tuesday for conspiracy to cause criminal damage and fraud after her group attacked banks such as HSBC and Barclays. Activists from the group smashed the window frontage of HSBC and Barclays in Canary Wharf last month and have targeted Lloyd's of London as part of what the activists cast as a ""Money Rebellion"". ""Extinction Rebellion co-founder Gail Bradbrook was arrested by officers from the Metropolitan Police at her home in Stroud at around 5:30 am this morning for conspiracy to cause criminal damage and fraud in relation to Money Rebellion's debt disobedience,"" a spokeswoman for the group said. The fraud allegation stems from a campaign to use personal credit card debt to make donations to groups allegedly damaged by banks - and then refusing to pay off the debt, a spokeswoman said. Bradbrook, 49, who has a Ph.D. in molecular biophysics, says Britain and other countries are acting far too slowly to stop devastating climate change and that the Western financial system is fuelling the abuse of the planet."
" Limiting global warming to 1.5°C could halve how much sea levels rise due to melting ice sheets this century, according to a major new study modelling how Earth's frozen spaces will respond to ever-increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Since 1993, melting land ice has contributed to at least half of global sea level rise and scientists have previously warned that the vast ice sheets of Antarctica were disappearing faster than worst-case scenarios. An international team of more than 50 climate scientists combined hundreds of melt simulations of the Antarctica and Greenland ice sheets, which contain enough frozen water to raise the world's seas some 65 metres (213 feet). They also included melt modelling from Earth's more than 220,000 glaciers, which make up only one percent of ice on the planet but contribute as much as a fifth of sea level rise. The team analysed the models to come up with probability estimates of how much melting ice would raise oceans under a variety of emissions pathways. They found that if mankind successfully limits warming to 1.5°C -- the goal set down in the Paris climate deal -- it could halve ice's contribution to sea level rise by 2100. This is compared with the roughly 3C of warming Earth would undergo if countries' current emissions-cutting pledges played out. ""Global sea level is going to continue to rise,"" said lead study author Tamsin Edwards, from King's College London's department of geography. ""But we could halve that contribution from ice melting if we limit warming to 1.5°C, relative to current pledges."" Antarctic uncertainty The study, published in the journal Nature, found that the average contribution to sea level rise from melting ice at 1.5°C was 13 centimetres (five inches) by 2100, compared to the 25 centimetres currently projected. The analysis showed that sea level rise attributed to the Greenland ice sheet would fall 70 percent if the 1.5°C target was met, and land-based glaciers' contribution would roughly halve. However the projections were less clear and varied widely when it came to Antarctica. Co-author Sophie Nowicki, from the NASA Goddard Flight Center, said the uncertainty in the models was largely down to what extent increased snowfall across a warming continent would offset melting from the ice shelves. ""Greenland is really sensitive to atmospheric changes, and so in a warmer world you get more melting on the surface of the ice sheets,"" said Nowicki. ""In Antarctica it is very complex. A warmer world could mean more snowfall, but it could also mean more melt at the side of the icesheet."" The calculations showed a 95 percent chance that Antarctica would contribute less than 56 centimetres to sea level rise by 2100. But under a ""pessimistic scenario"", the study showed, Antarctica could raise global oceans by more than that even if humanity manages to cap warming at 1.5°C. 'Irreversible' melt A second study, also published Wednesday in Nature, found that limiting warming to 2C above industrial levels was likely to maintain the current rate of ice melt in Antarctica. However, if current emissions-cutting pledges are not intensified by 2060, the models showed that the continent could contribute half a centimetre to sea levels every year by 2100. Furthermore, the study warned that if emissions continue at their current levels, a tipping point will be reached around 2060 which would lead to Antarctic melt that would be ""irreversible on multi-century timescales"". The research, led by a team from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, modelled how the ice shelves that keep the Antarctic ice sheet from collapsing into the sea were likely to respond to temperature changes this century. With greater warming, the ice shelves thin and become more fragile, the models showed, risking accelerated melt from the ice sheet, as well as ""calving"", which is when large chunks of ice break off into the sea, as has happened already in parts of the Arctic. ""Global warming above 2C increases risk of exceeding a tipping point- where ice shelves thin or collapse, allowing a major acceleration in ice loss- and sea level rise,"" lead author Robert DeConto told AFP."
" The US and China are committed to cooperating to tackle climate change, they said in a joint statement after meetings between senior envoys last week. The two nations will work together and with other parties to support implementation of the Paris Agreement and to promote a successful UN climate change conference in Glasgow later this year, they said. The US and China support the Paris Agreement’s aim to limit the increase in the global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celcius and to try to restrict it to 1.5 degrees Celcius, according to the statement."
" In the midst of the heated US presidential race last summer, with hypercharged scrutiny of partisan propaganda on social media, Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg received a letter from a group of US senators led by Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren that had nothing to do with elections. They were angry about a year-old piece of climate news. A Washington Examiner article shared on Facebook in 2019 had denounced climate models, which are widely used by scientists around the world to measure and predict the impacts of warmer temperatures. Science Feedback, an outside organization Facebook works with on fact-checking, had labeled the story false. A review by five scientists found the story “highly misleading” because of “false factual assertions” and accused the authors of “cherry-picking datasets.” The conclusion meant Facebook posts linking to the story would now be saddled with a label saying it had been disputed.  But then Facebook said because the article was designated as an op-ed, it was exempt from fact checks under the company’s policies. The “false” label was removed. Warren’s letter called the op-ed policy a “massive loophole.” Facebook’s policies on climate lies “represents another unfortunate example of Facebook’s refusal to fully combat the deliberate spread of misinformation,” she added. Climate change has emerged as a key priority in Facebook’s quest to stomp out misinformation, a complicated effort that involves policing user posts while simultaneously defending free speech. In the past few months the company has started fighting climate misinformation with some of the same strategies used to battle Covid‑19 myths and election falsehoods—a sign of the topic’s growing importance internally. But Facebook’s misinformation policies have also left climate activists frustrated. Zuckerberg got another letter last month, this time from 13 environmental groups including the Union of Concerned Scientists and Greenpeace, asking the company to commit to monitoring climate disinformation and releasing reports, among other things. “Climate change disinformation is spreading rapidly across Facebook’s social media platform, threatening the ability of citizens and policymakers to fight the climate crisis,” the groups wrote. Unlike elections, which have shorter timelines, climate change is a long-term problem with no definitive ending. That means Facebook doesn’t consider lies about the climate an “imminent” threat of real-world harm, which is the threshold the company uses to determine whether a post containing misinformation should be removed from the service entirely.  “It is an immediate threat, and the fact that they don’t see that makes me mad,” says Naomi Oreskes, a professor of the history of science at Harvard and the co-author of Merchants of Doubt, a book about climate science being deliberately obscured. “We have enormous evidence now that many storms, floods, hurricanes, cyclones have been made worse by climate change.” At a congressional hearing last month, Zuckerberg admitted that climate misinformation is “a big issue.” A Facebook spokesman says climate change misinformation accounts for a very low percentage of total misinformation on the service but declined to share figures. Experts who follow climate misinformation have had a tough time quantifying its presence on Facebook given a lack of access to private groups and messages, but they’ve seen how small lies can spread quickly. When millions of Texans lost power in February, Facebook failed to label a number of posts falsely claiming that “wind turbine failures were a leading cause of blackouts,” according to Avaaz, a nonprofit group that studied the issue. The top 10 posts promoting those claims, none of which received fact check labels, garnered an estimated 15.8 million views, Avaaz found. “Even if it seems like it’s a small number of actors sometimes, the scale of Facebook’s algorithm and its reach as the world’s information highway right now means that millions of people will be impacted by what they see on that platform,” says Fadi Quran, a campaign director at Avaaz. An outside climate watchdog called InfluenceMap found in October 2020 that dozens of climate denial ads slipped through the social network’s filters and garnered 8 million views. The ads were targeted to older users in more rural, Republican-leaning states, making them more impactful, says Dylan Tanner, executive director of InfluenceMap. “The power of that targeting makes that 8 million even more powerful,” he says. A Facebook search in March by Bloomberg Green found a handful of groups, with thousands of members, with names such as “Man Made Global Warming is a HOAX” and “Climate Crisis? There is NO Climate Crisis!” A Facebook spokesman says “we take action against pages, groups, and accounts that repeatedly share false claims.” When fact-checkers rate content as false, he says, “we add a warning label and reduce its distribution.” Groups that repeatedly share misinformation aren’t removed, but are no longer recommended by Facebook’s algorithm, he adds. Climate misinformation has been around for decades, with lobbying efforts and marketing by Big Oil as far back as the 1980s, but Oreskes says social media may be making it worse. A regular public speaker on climate issues, she’s noticed in recent years that attendees’ questions often mirror online memes. “When it spreads to social media it’s even more pernicious,” Oreskes says, “because now you’re hearing it from a friend or relative.” Just as Facebook can exacerbate a false narrative, it also has the ability to change it entirely. With almost 2.8 billion users globally, the social network has an opportunity with climate change that it hasn’t had with other topics—a chance to educate millions of people without the pressure of a looming election or public health crisis. Facebook’s efforts to fight climate-related misinformation picked up last year when it called a handful of experts to ask for help. That led the company to create the Climate Science Information Center, a dedicated space on the service with scientist-approved information. The center appears as the top search result when users query climate-related terms, like “global warming” or “greenhouse gases.” Users can see charts mapping the average annual temperature of their state, or click to read facts about declining polar bear populations or excess carbon dioxide. The data are meant to counter common misconceptions that people share on Facebook, including claims that the concept of climate change is widely disputed among scientists (not true), or that climbing temperatures are not the result of human activity (also false). Facebook is already adding links to the center on user posts about climate change for some in the UK, and could soon expand those labels to other countries. Widespread labeling posts is the same approach Facebook used for the 2020 US election and for Covid‑19 vaccine information. It’s a strategy that aligns with one of Zuckerberg’s key beliefs: The best way to fight misinformation is with more information. “There has long been this kind of purity default that we should treat all of this as ‘we are just a platform for the free expression of ideas,’” says Anthony Leiserowitz, the founder and director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, who advised Facebook on its climate hub and was not paid by the company. “Maybe through force, maybe through argument inside, they are increasingly recognizing that’s just not an adequate answer to the challenges they are facing.” Experts say the info center is a good effort but only a start. Oreskes still thinks Facebook should remove climate misinformation entirely. Quran wants Facebook to retroactively notify people if they’ve previously seen misinformation by putting alerts in their feed. “If the goal is addressing misinformation, just providing facts is not an adequate solution,” says John Cook, a research fellow at the Climate Change Communication Research Hub at Monash University in Melbourne.  He also consulted on Facebook’s effort without pay. “But I think they recognize that themselves.” There’s reason to suspect Facebook’s recent efforts may signal more changes to come. Climate change is an issue of great importance to the company’s employees, according to internal surveys, and top executives agree. Zuckerberg once said stopping climate change was “one of the most important challenges of our generation,” and Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement marked one of the few times Zuckerberg publicly criticized the former president. Chris Cox, the social network’s longtime head of product and one of its most powerful executives, is also a climate advocate. He advised and invested in multiple climate-related startups during a brief year away from Facebook. Cox’s return in May 2020 added “a huge amount of momentum” to some of the company’s climate-related products, says Edward Palmieri, Facebook’s director of sustainability. “The Climate Science Information Center is something that we had been thinking about, but Chris was able to help us move even faster and get even more resources.” If the company manages to effectively combat climate misinformation, it could be a major step toward educating millions of people. A failure to stop the lies from spreading, on the other hand, could be devastating. “[It’s] not just an important opportunity, but responsibility to give their users access to quality information,” Leiserowitz says. “To go to an old saying: You never get a second chance to make a first impression.”"
" Indonesia is expanding programs to mitigate the impact from climate change following a recent spate of natural disasters that has added pressure to economic recovery. A mangrove planting campaign to boost the ecosystem and landscape resilience will target areas of 600,000 hectares across the nation, a jump from 15,000 in 2020, Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya, said in a speech Monday. A program to make villages environmentally friendly will be modified to increase involvement with local residents, she said. “We need to adapt to a new normal global health landscape and a more extreme climate simultaneously,” Nurbaya said. This is why we have “high ambition to achieve a climate change agenda.” Natural disasters, including a deadly flood in Kalimantan, volcanic eruption in Java and earthquakes in Sulawesi, are dimming the prospects for a turnaround in Southeast Asia’s largest economy. Growth in the first quarter is also at risk amid further restrictions to curb Covid-19 infections that last year dragged the economy to its first recession in two decades. A massive overhaul of regulations passed last year in favor of business investments drew protests from thousands of students, civil society groups and labor unions. The so-called Omnibus Law weakens the environment and remove legal protections for indigenous groups, raising concerns about potential land grabs, according to an Oct. 15 statement from Human Rights Watch. Is Indonesia Selling Out to Global Investors?: Daniel Moss Shrinking forest The government is looking to see if deforestation, which led to other factors such as poor drainage and decreased land coverage, may have worsened the devastating impact from flooding in South Kalimantan, as claimed by activists. Forest areas along the Barito River basin in South Kalimantan province shrank by 63% during the 1990-2019 period due to expansion of agricultural croplands, urbanization, and mining, according to a report released earlier this month by the environment ministry. The flood in January inundated 70,000 homes, displaced 76,000 residents and killed at least 15 people. The main river that usually can take up about 238 million cubic meter of water was overwhelmed by 2.08 billion cubic meter of water flowing in during the high rain intensity, the ministry said. “Even the best ecological infrastructure there can’t hold in water when extreme weather brings in 2 billion cubic meters of water,” Hanif Faisol Nurofiq, secretary for director general of forestry planning and environmental management, said in a briefing on Jan. 19. Repeated hydro-meteorological disasters such as floods and landslides proved that the government isn’t doing enough, Indonesian environmental group Walhi said in a statement on Jan. 25. “Any corrective actions the government said it is doing on climate, they are moving very slowly.” Polemic “This polemic about the flood is understandable because there is a desire to quickly find the cause and to immediately resolve it,” the ministry said. “Therefore, all aspects need to be systematically identified and an in-depth” study is needed. The first quarter will be “very tough” as natural disasters typically occur at the start of the year, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said in an interview Saturday. “We want to have a better way to address the issue.” Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter"
" Last year tied with 2016 as the world’s warmest year on record, rounding off the hottest decade globally as the impacts of climate change intensified, the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service said on Friday. After an exceptionally warm winter and autumn in Europe, the continent experienced its hottest year on record in 2020, while the Arctic suffered extreme heat and atmospheric concentrations of planet-warming carbon dioxide continued to rise. Scientists said the latest data underscored the need for countries and corporations to slash greenhouse gas emissions quickly enough to bring within reach the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement to avoid catastrophic climate change. “The extraordinary climate events of 2020 and the data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service show us that we have no time to lose,” said Matthias Petschke, Director for Space in the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm. The bloc’s space programmes include the Copernicus earth observation satellites. In 2020, temperatures globally were an average of 1.25 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) higher than in pre-industrial times, Copernicus said. The last six years were the world’s hottest on record. The Paris accord aims to cap the rise in temperatures to “well below” 2 degrees C and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees C to avoid the most devastating impacts of climate change. “The key here is to... reduce the amount we emit,” Copernicus senior scientist Freja Vamborg told Reuters. Last year also saw the highest temperature ever reliably recorded, when in August a California heatwave pushed the temperature at Death Valley in the Mojave Desert up to 54.4C (129.92°F). The Arctic and northern Siberia continued to warm more quickly than the planet as a whole in 2020, with temperatures in parts of these regions averaging more than 6C above a 30-year average used as a baseline, Copernicus said. The region also had an “unusually active” wildfire season, with fires poleward of the Arctic Circle releasing a record 244 million tonnes of CO2 in 2020, over a third more than in 2019. Arctic sea ice continued to deplete, with July and October both setting records for the lowest sea ice extent in that month. Scientists who were not involved in the study said it was consistent with growing evidence that climate change is contributing to more intense hurricanes, fires, floods and other disasters. In the United States, the costs in lives and damage is fast rising, said Adam Smith, a climate scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). “We need another dictionary to help us describe how these extremes continue to play out and unfold year after year,” said Smith, who tracks climate-related disasters that cause more than a billion dollars worth of damage.

" 2020 was the warmest year in Europe since records began, according to data published Friday by the EU climate monitoring service. Last year topped the previous temperature record in Europe — 2019 — by a whopping 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 Fahrenheit), the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service said. It said 2020 was also tied with 2016 for the warmest year worldwide, confirming the past decade as the hottest on record. Rising global temperatures are tied to the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Chief among them is carbon dioxide, which is released by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. The data showed 2020 was 1.25 C (2.2 F) warmer than during the pre-industrial period from 1850-1900. Scientists say global warming should be capped at 1.5 C (2.7 F) to avert the worst effects of climate change."
" The second-warmest year on record brought storms, fires and floods that killed at least 8,200 people and cost the world $210 billion in losses, according to a report by Munich Re.The insurer is still calculating where 2020 ranks against other calamitous years but said damages last year exceeded those of 2019, which saw $166 billion in losses.“Natural catastrophe losses in 2020 were significantly higher than the previous year,” Torsten Jeworrek, a member of Munich’s board of management said in the report. “Record numbers for many relevant hazards are a cause for concern, whether we are talking about the severe hurricane season, major wildfires or the series of thunderstorms in the US.” Six of the most expensive disasters happened in the US, including a destructive derecho in the Midwest, a record number of tropical storms and hurricanes strikes and an all-time high acreage burn in California. US damages totaled at least $95 billion, with $67 billion of that in insured losses, said Munich. The disasters piled up as the world came within 0.01 Celsius of tying the warmest year on record set in 2016, Munich said. While it didn’t draw direct link between 2020’s disasters and climate change, the insurer said the ongoing issues caused by a warming world would raise the potential for more perilous years ahead. “Even if the weather disasters for one year cannot be directly linked to climate change, and a longer period needs to be studied to assess their significance, these extreme values fit with the expected consequences of a decades-long warming trend for the atmosphere and oceans that is influencing risks,” said Ernst Rauch, chief climate and geoscientist at Munich Re."
" A new study uncovered how grasslands used by humans have changed our climate over the last centuries. Grasslands are managed worldwide to support livestock production while remaining natural or semi-natural ones provide critical services that contribute to the wellbeing of both people and the planet. Human activities are, however, causing grasslands to become a source of greenhouse gas emissions rather than a carbon sink. Grasslands are the most extensive terrestrial biome on Earth and are critically important for animal forage, biodiversity and ecosystem services. They absorb and release carbon dioxide (CO2) and emit methane (CH4) from grazing livestock and nitrous oxide (N2O) from soils, especially when manure or mineral fertilizers are introduced. Little is known, however, about how the fluxes of these three greenhouse gases from managed and natural grasslands worldwide have contributed to climate change in the past, and about the role of managed pastures versus natural or very sparsely grazed grasslands. To address this knowledge gap, an international research team quantified the changes in carbon storage and greenhouse gas fluxes in natural and managed grasslands between 1750 and 2012 in their study published in Nature Communications. The study’s comprehensive estimates of global grasslands’ contribution to past climate change illustrate the important climate cooling service provided by sparsely grazed areas, and the growing contribution to warming from quickly increasing livestock numbers and more intensive management, which are in turn associated with more CH4 and N2O emissions in determining the contemporary net climate effect of the grassland biome. “We built and applied a new spatially explicit global grassland model that includes mechanisms of soil organic matter and plant productivity changes driven by historical shifts in livestock and the reduction of wild grazers in each region. This model is one of the first to simulate the regional details of land use change and degradation from livestock overload,” explains Jinfeng Chang who led this study at IIASA and is now based at Zhejiang University in China. “We also looked at the effect of fires, and soil carbon losses by water erosion; CH4 emissions from animals; N2O emissions from animal excrement, manure, and mineral fertilizer applications; and atmospheric nitrogen deposition.” The study shows that emissions of CH4 and N2O from grasslands increased by a factor of 2.5 since 1750 due to increased emissions from livestock that have more than compensated for reduced emissions from the shrinking number of wild grazers. The net carbon sink effect of grasslands worldwide - in other words, the ability of grasslands to absorb more carbon and pack it in the soil - was estimated to have intensified over the last century, but mainly over sparsely grazed and natural grasslands. Conversely, over the last decade, grasslands intensively managed by humans have become a net source of greenhouse gas emissions - in fact, it has greenhouse gas emission levels similar to those of global croplands, which represent a large source of greenhouse gases. “Our results show that the different human activities that have affected grasslands have shifted the balance of greenhouse gas removals and emissions more towards warming in intensively exploited pastures, and more towards cooling in natural and semi-natural systems. Coincidently, until recently the two types of grasslands have almost been canceling each other out,” notes coauthor Thomas Gasser from IIASA. “However, the recent trends we see towards the expansion of pasture land and higher livestock numbers lead us to expect that global grasslands will accelerate climate warming if better policies are not put in place to favor soil carbon increases, stop deforestation for ranching, and develop climate-smart livestock production systems.” According to the authors, the cooling services provided by sparsely grazed or wild grasslands makes it clear that countries should assess not only the greenhouse gas budgets of their managed pastures (such as specified in the current national greenhouse gas reporting rules of the UN’s Framework Convention on Climate Change), but also the sinks and sources of sparsely grazed rangelands, steppes, tundra, and wild grasslands. Full greenhouse gas reporting for each country could facilitate the assessment of progress towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and better link national greenhouse gas budgets to the observed growth rates of emissions in the atmosphere. “In the context of low-warming climate targets, the mitigating or amplifying role of grasslands will depend on a number of aspects. This includes future changes in grass-fed livestock numbers; the stability of accumulated soil carbon in grasslands; and whether carbon storage can be further increased over time or if it will saturate, as observed in long-term experiments,” concludes Philippe Ciais, a study co-author from the Laboratory for Sciences of Climate and Environment (LSCE).

" The amount of baked-in global warming, from carbon pollution already in the air, is enough to blow past international agreed upon goals to limit climate change, a new study finds. But it’s not game over because, while that amount of warming may be inevitable, it can be delayed for centuries if the world quickly stops emitting extra greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, the study’s authors say. For decades, scientists have talked about so-called “committed warming” or the increase in future temperature based on past carbon dioxide emissions that stay in the atmosphere for well over a century. It’s like the distance a speeding car travels after the brakes are applied. But Monday’s study in the journal Nature Climate Change calculates that a bit differently and now figures the carbon pollution already put in the air will push global temperatures to about 2.3 degrees Celsius (4.1 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times. Previous estimates, including those accepted by international science panels, were about a degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) less than that amount of committed warming. International climate agreements set goals of limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times, with the more ambitious goal of limiting it to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) added in Paris in 2015. The world has already warmed about 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit). “You’ve got some ... global warming inertia that’s going to cause the climate system to keep warming, and that’s essentially what we’re calculating,” said study co-author Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University. “Think about the climate system like the Titanic. It’s hard to turn the ship when you see the icebergs.” Dessler and colleagues at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab and Nanjing University in China calculated committed warming to take into account that the world has warmed at different rates in different places and that places that haven’t warmed as fast are destined to catch up. Places such as the Southern Ocean, surrounding Antarctica are a bit cooler, and that difference creates low-lying clouds that reflect more sun away from earth, keeping these places cooler. But this situation can’t keep going indefinitely because physics dictates that cooler locations will warm up more and when they do, the clouds will dwindle and more heating will occur, Dessler said. Previous studies were based on the cooler spots staying that way, but Dessler and colleagues say that’s not likely. Outside experts said the work is based on compelling reasoning, but want more research to show that it’s true. Breakthrough Institute climate scientist Zeke Hausfather said the new work fits better with climate models than observational data. Just because the world is bound to get more warming than international goals, that doesn’t mean all is lost in the fight against global warming, said Dessler, who cautioned against what he called “climate doomers.” (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text)"
" Zoos across the country were put on alert on Tuesday after the bird flu outbreak in the region, including Himachal Pradesh. After the highly infectious Asian avian influenza (H5N1) led to the death of more than 2,500 migratory birds in Pong Dam wetland in Himachal’s Kangra district besides 1 lakh poultry birds in Haryana’s Barwala belt in Panchkula district suspected to be due to the virus, the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change sounded the alert among zoos with the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) rolling out an advisory on January 4, directing the authorities to remain vigilant for animals showing symptoms. The Centre asked the zoo authorities to prepare and prevent the ingress of avian influenza in line with the national action plan on prevention, control and containment of the flu. “It is advised that all zoos remain alert and vigilant for any symptoms among captive animals and incidence, if any, in nearby areas,” said Dr Sonali Ghosh, a deputy inspector general of forests, in a letter to the member secretary of state zoo authority and officers in charge of all zoos.

" Because of the massive disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, most of 2020 was spent tracking very short-term statistics; from daily tests and new cases to monthly, even weekly indicators of economic activity. Important as they were and continue to be, the beginning of a New Year is an opportune time to take a long-term view of what India will be like 10 years from now. Here are five charts that can help give us an idea. 1. India will be the most populous country in the world According to the World Bank’s projections, India will overtake China to become the most populous country in 2023, when its population will reach 1.42 billion. The United States will continue to be the third most populated country in this decade. There were 1.21 billion people in India according to the 2011 census and there is still uncertainty about whether or not the 2021 census will be completed on time. China’s population will hit a peak of 1.425 billion in 2030 and start declining after that. Most countries experience this phenomenon as fertility rates fall below replacement levels. It will take at least until 2048 for India’s population to start declining after peaking at around 1.6 billion, according to estimates published by The Lancet.   2. This is the last decade to make the best use of demographic dividend in India Contrary to what is often believed, a large population need not be an economic liability for nations. Countries with a high share of the working-age population – this is not a permanent phenomenon – also have more earning hands. If one takes 20-59 year olds as working-age population, its share in India’s total population will almost peak by the end of this decade. India’s working-age group population is projected to increase from 55.8% this year to 58.8% by 2031. This equals a growth of nearly 97 million people in the workforce, which means the country needs to create employment opportunities for a large number of people. The population of elderly is also projected to increase by 2 million, creating the need for social security measures to support the rising elderly population. To be sure, the growth in the working-age group population will not be the same across states and Union territories. States like Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh are projected to record the highest rise in working-age group population this decade (it will increase by 23% in these three states combined). On the contrary, the three southern states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are projected to record the lowest growth in this population (2.5% combined). This mismatch will mean that northern states will see a very high share of people looking for jobs, compared to those in the south, which may lead to a an increase in north-to-south migration for work.   3. Structure of political representation could veer away from federalism The uneven growth in population in the northern and southern states will also have political consequences. The current state-wise distribution of parliamentary seats is based on the 1971 census. With the growing gap in the state-wise population, this distribution puts more voters per seat in some states than others. For example, if the latest (2020) electoral roll data is used, Tamil Nadu has 1.56 million voters per Lok Sabha member. This number is 1.8 million for Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. There is a constitutional freeze on the number of Lok Sabha seats from each state up to 2026. The next delimitation may not be conducted until the 2031 Census is completed. This means that the state-wise asymmetry in population will continue to increase. To be sure, there is another view to this story as well, which believes that a simple redistribution of seats by current population levels will penalise the states that have done well to bring down their population growth. Either way, the resolution will put India’s federal structure through a big test.   4. Consequences of climate crisis will make their presence felt India’s first climate change assessment by the ministry of earth sciences (MoES), published in 2020. said that the climate change seen in the country since the middle of the 20th century is expected to continue in the future. For example, average temperature has risen by around 0.7 degree Celsius during 1901-2018, according to the assessment. By the end of the 21st century (2070-2099), this is expected to rise by around 4.4 degrees Celsius compared to the recent past (1976-2005). The frequency of summer (April-June) heat waves is also projected to increase 3-4 times. While monsoon precipitation (rainfall) has declined, there are more frequent dry spells and more intense wet spells, according to the report. According to a paper published by researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, last year (https://bit.ly/34WQLJ5) while rainfall of higher intensity will increase all over India, the degree of increase will be more in the south Indian region compared to north and central India by the end of the century. According to a 2018 World Bank report, a large part of South Asia would be climate hotspots – where changes in temperature and rainfall affect living standards adversely – by 2030.   5. How well will India’s economy grow? Thanks to the disruption caused by the pandemic, the Indian economy will witness its first contraction in 41 years in 2020-21. If the 2020-21 gross domestic product (GDP) were to contract by 7.5% (the Reserve Bank of India estimate), 2010-11 to 2020-21 will see the lowest decadal growth in India’s GDP since the 1980s. There are divergent views on the prospects of the Indian economy going forward. The government and a section of economists see a rapid revival in economic activity. Others see a long-term loss of momentum. For example, Oxford economists expect potential growth for Indian economy at 4.5% over the next five years (till 2025) which is lower than 6.5% projected before the viral outbreak. Whether or not the Indian economy can rediscover its mojo will determine how the country deals with the challenges and opportunities presented by a high share of the working-age population."
" Sweden’s Greta Thunberg, who pioneered a global climate change campaign as a 15-year-old, turned 18 on Sunday and promised to celebrate by exposing “dark secrets” at her local pub. “Thank you so much for all the well-wishes on my 18th birthday!,” Thunberg said on Twitter. “Tonight you will find me down at the local pub exposing all the dark secrets behind the climate- and school strike conspiracy and my evil handlers who can no longer control me! I am free at last!!.” Thunberg began a climate change campaign that swelled from a one-person school strike to a worldwide movement, drawing in millions of school children, as well as adults."
" It has been estimated that countries around the world may have spent a total of $6 trillion to deal with the economic consequences of Covid-19, not counting the billions spent in laboratories around the world to fast-track an effective vaccine. The existential nature of the threat from the pandemic justified this extraordinary response even though nations failed to pool their scientific and financial resources to enable a collective and collaborative response. This is the second time during this millennium that we have witnessed an international response on this scale. There was a massive deployment of economic stimulus packages by G-20 countries to respond to the global financial and economic crisis (GFEC) of 2007-08. This was successful in averting a meltdown of the global trading and financial system. Both during GFEC and the current crisis we hear the same exhortation — that countries should engage in a green recovery from the crisis, that they should rebuild their economies in an ecologically-sustainable manner, that these crises are urgent intimations of the threat to planetary survival, which are ignored at our collective peril. But if current indications are anything to go by we are witnessing the revival, even intensification of the ecologically-damaging production and consumption patterns, which have landed us in this predicament. Carbon emissions are rising once again as economies begin to revive. Environmental safeguards are being relaxed on the plea that industries badly hit by the pandemic cannot bear the burden of such regulation at least for some time. The United Nations (UN) recently convened a virtual Climate Ambition Summit at which the secretary-general called for member-states to declare a Climate Emergency and take drastic action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enable climate adaptation. While several states committed themselves to achieving carbon neutrality by mid-century they gave little evidence of their willingness to come together to deal with what the incoming United States (US) President Joe Biden has described as an “existential threat of our time”. Should not there be an urgent mobilisation of world’s top scientists to deliver climate-friendly technologies with the same urgency as they have created effective vaccines against Covid-19 within just a year? Should not countries deploy large economic recovery funds to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels to non-fossil and cleaner sources of energy? The climate challenge will unleash a crisis of a scale and severity before which the current pandemic will pale into insignificance. Are the lessons of the pandemic going to be left unlearnt? The chairperson of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Hoesung Lee, had this to say in his brief remarks at the summit: “We are currently on a path risking serious, pervasive and irreversible impacts.” Do we need any more convincing? The pandemic has generated a welcome debate on what constitutes true value and how may this be measured? Our accounting systems, on the basis of which we calculate business risks and profits and losses, are biased towards demonstrable, quantifiable and immediate effects. They undervalue effects which may manifest over longer periods or for which we have not yet developed measuring tools. Not everything that counts can be counted and not everything which can be counted counts. There is an added problem of measuring feedback loops among inter-related domains. For example, food, water and energy security are closely inter-linked and intervention in one domain has knock-on effects in other domains. Our current accounting systems can only handle linear effects in single domains. It was loss of biodiversity that shrunk wildlife habitat, bringing unfamiliar viruses carried by wild species into contact with domesticated animals and human beings. What may have been justified by arguments of food security and expanding human settlements had no means of assessing the serious health risks this generated. This is related to the classic problem of dealing with external economies where it is not possible to relate individual cost incurred to individual benefit received as the latter is socialised. Challenges such as climate change and public health require such socialisation of costs and benefits and because they are global in dimension, they can only be dealt with through multilateral processes. The Covid-19 pandemic has starkly exposed the perils of the rampant degradation of our planet’s fragile ecology. Linked to this is the industrialisation of food production, based on mass-breeding of beef, cattle, sheep, pork and poultry in conditions that make the spread of infections and contamination of the food chain all but inevitable. Plastics may be convenient to use but they are now clogging our rivers, lakes and the ocean. These are all cross-domain issues and need to be treated in a comprehensive frame and through global efforts. Could India take the intellectual lead in pioneering new methods of measuring value? The Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is scheduled to be held in Glasgow at the end of 2021. This gives Indian diplomacy a year in which to mobilise the international community in favour of a path- breaking outcome based on science and the principle of equitable burden-sharing. On this, India’s interests are fully aligned with the world at large.

" India currently consumes only one-third of the global average consumption of energy. As we move towards more robust energy consumption figures, the country faces the unique challenge of fusing together disparate needs: A ballooning appetite while cutting dependence on imports; greening the grid while ensuring affordability; and replacing old forms of energy production while boosting employment, and the human and economic capital of the people. Then there’s the fact that the energy sector is closely intertwined with issues related to climate change. Needless to say, a vigorous ideation needs to undergird such energy transitions. The question is particularly cardinal for the sector I am in charge of: Petroleum and natural gas. We import about 84% of our oil and 56% of our gas for domestic use — and this in itself tends to negate the deliverables — delineated above — that we aspire to achieve. In this context, biofuels have become a tool for achieving these delicate balance of outcomes. In the past few years, progress made in the use of ethanol, compressed biogas and biodiesel — all different forms of biofuel — will have a direct positive impact on both farm incomes (and the prosperity of agricultural communities), even as it cuts down our import dependence for energy. Currently, the aim is to achieve 10% ethanol blending in petrol by 2022 and 20% blending by 2030 — something that will cut down carbon emissions in vehicles. In 2019, in a first for the Republic Day parade, the Indian Air Force flew aircraft in a Vic formation, with the lead plane using a mix of traditional fuel and biofuel, symbolising the government’s determination to seek alternative sources of fuel. The primary raw material for ethanol production in India is sugarcane and its by-products, accounting for more than 90% of fuel ethanol supplies under the ethanol blended petrol (EBP) programme of the ministry. This programme injects liquidity into the stressed sugar sector and provides an alternative revenue stream to farmers. This programme also encourages diversion of sugarcane for ethanol production, which results in a decrease in the sugar glut in the country. Ethanol supplies have improved from 380 million litres in 2013-14 to 1.89 billion litres in 2019. Offers of about 3.5 billion litres from both sugar/molasses and grain-based distilleries are expected this year. In addition to sugarcane, ethanol is also produced from damaged food grains, B-heavy molasses and sugarcane juice. This translates into a sum of nearly ₹35,000 crore in the past six years — money that has flown back to farmers through sugar mills and distilleries as oil marketing companies (OMCs) provide off-take guarantee at fixed prices. This arrangement also improves the health of the payment cycle to farmers since OMCs settle their ethanol dues to distilleries in 21 days instead of the months that the farmers had to wait for their payment from sugar mills. The recent decision to utilise surplus rice available with the Food Corporation of India and maize as an additional source of feedstock for ethanol production, starting this year, means farmers will now have an alternative market for their produce. With regards biodiesel, the National Policy on Biofuels in 2018 targets 5% blending of biodiesel in diesel by 2030. The policy encourages setting up of supply chain mechanisms for biodiesel production from non-edible oilseeds, used cooking oil and short-gestation crops. These crops can be easily cultivated in various states on land that is barren or not fit for edible crops, thus boosting farm incomes. Biodiesel procured by OMCs for blending high speed diesel has increased from 11.9 million litres in 2015-16 to 105.5 million litres last year. The Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) scheme launched in October 2018 aims to establish an ecosystem for production of compressed biogas (CBG) from various waste biomass sources in the country. Under SATAT, 5000 CBG plants with a total production capacity of 15 million metric tonne per annum (MMTPA), which is equivalent to 54 MMSCMD of gas by 2023, has been planned. This initiative offers a potential for investment of about ₹1.75 lakh crore, generating about 75,000 direct employment opportunities. Many of the proposed plants will use crop residue such as paddy straw and biomass as feedstock for production of CBG, especially in Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. The SATAT scheme will not only stanch greenhouse gas emissions, but will reduce burning of agricultural residue, which results in significant air pollution in cities like Delhi, generate employment in rural and waste management sectors, and boost income for farmers from their unutilised organic waste. One of the byproducts of CBG plants is biomanure, which can be used in farming. The components of a biofuel supply chain create a circular rural economy that results in substantial environmental, socio-economic and health benefits for communities. A total of ₹1 lakh crore worth of biofuel will be purchased by OMCs every year in the near future for blending. This money will be ploughed back to the rural economy, thus doubling farmers’ incomes. Keeping in mind international climate commitments and domestic requirements, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s emphasis has been on energy availability, accessibility and affordability; efficiency in energy use; energy sustainability; and energy security for mitigating global uncertainties. The quest, therefore, has been to shift the perception and the functioning of my ministry from one focused on international trade to one that strengthens the human development indices of the poorest standing in the queue.

" The ten costliest weather disasters worldwide this year saw insured damages worth $150 billion, topping the figure for 2019 and reflecting a long-term impact of global warming, according to a report Monday. The same disasters claimed at least 3,500 lives and displaced more than 13.5 million people. From Australia’s out-of-control wildfires in January to a record number of Atlantic hurricanes through November, the true cost of the year’s climate-enhanced calamities was in fact far higher because most losses were uninsured. Not surprisingly, the burden fell disproportionately on poor nations, according to the annual tally from global NGO Christian Aid, entitled “Count the cost of 2020: a year of climate breakdown”. Only four percent of economic losses from climate-impacted extreme events in low-income countries were insured, compared with 60 percent in high-income economies, the report said, citing a study last month in The Lancet. “Whether floods in Asia, locusts in Africa, or storms in Europe and the Americas, climate change has continued to rage in 2020,” said Christian Aid’s climate policy lead, Kat Kramer. Extreme weather disasters, of course, have plagued humanity long before manmade global warming began to mess with the planet’s climate system. But more than a century of temperature and precipitation data, along with decades of satellite data on hurricanes and sea level rise, have left no doubt that Earth’s warming surface temperature is amplifying their impact. Massive tropical storms -- variously known as hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones -- are now more likely, for example, to be stronger, last longer, carry more water and wander beyond their historical range. 2020’s record-breaking 30 named Atlantic hurricanes -- with at least 400 fatalities and $41 billion in damages -- suggest the world could see more such storms as well. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) had to use Greek symbols after running out of letters in the Latin alphabet. - Extremes, not averages - Intense summer flooding in China and India, where the monsoon season brought abnormal amounts of rainfall for the second year running, are also consistent with projections on how climate will impact precipitation. Five of the most costly extreme weather events in 2020 were related to Asia’s unusually rainy monsoon. “The 2020 flood was one of the worst in the history of Bangladesh, more than a quarter of the country was under water,” said Shahjahan Mondal, director of the Institute of Flood and Water Management at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. Wildfires that scorched record areas in California, Australia and even Russia’s Siberian hinterland, much of it within the Arctic Circle, are also consistent with a warmer world, and a predicted to get worse as temperatures climb. The planet’s average surface temperature has gone up at least 1.1 degrees Celsius on average compared to the late 19th-century, with much of that warming occurring in the last half-century. The 2015 Paris Agreement enjoins the world’s nations to collectively cap global warming at “well below” 2C, and even 1.5C if feasible. A landmark report in 2018 from the UN’s IPCC climate science advisory panel showed that 1.5C is a safer threshold, but the likelihood of staying below it have grown vanishingly small, according to many experts. “Ultimately, the impacts of climate change will be felt via the extremes, and not average changes,” noted Sarah Perkins-Kilpatrick, a senior lecturer at the University of New South Wales’ Climate Change Research Centre. If the growing frequency and intensity of natural weather disasters is consistent with modelling projections, the new field of attribution science is now able to put a number on how much more likely such an event is due to global warming. The unprecedented wildfires that destroyed 20 percent of Australia’s forests and killed tens of millions of wild animals in late 2019 and early 2020, for example, were made at least 30 percent more likely, according to research led by Friederike Otto at the University of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute. In Europe, meanwhile, the chance of deadly heatwaves occurring has risen nearly 100 fold compared to a century ago, according to recent research. “Heatwaves and floods which used to be ‘once in a century’ events are becoming more regular occurrences,” noted WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas."
" In the last five years, Indian middle-class environmentalism has been amplified significantly. You’ll see this trend on social media and in many mainstream news reports. The question I ask is this : how do these campaigns shift the needle to reduce climate change and leverage social justice? Research by Jemyung Lee and others, and the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature, Japan, published, in the Journal for Environmental Change suggests middle class environmentalism will serve the planet best by reducing its own carbon footprint. The paper examines 203,313 households in 623 districts of India. Consider this finding : “Almost a tenfold difference is observed between the highest carbon footprint district, Gurgaon (2.04 ton CO2/capita), and the lowest carbon footprint district, Baudh (0.21 ton CO2/capita)” Today, Gurgaon’s most privileged residents are fighting for protecting the Aravallis and preventing a waste-to-energy plant. Both are important campaigns. Yet, this demographics likely causes untold harm elsewhere to maintain lifestyles. This is likely harming the poor whose access to clean water, open lands for grazing and other resources are often compromised by projects to service the wealthy. Gurgaon is not unique in its over-consumption. “Residents in Mumbai (1.76 ton CO2/ capita), New Delhi (0.98 ton CO2/capita), Bangalore (1.13 ton CO2/ capita), Chennai (1.11 ton CO2/capita), or Kolkata (1.56 ton CO2/capita) have a carbon footprint above the national average (0.56 ton CO2/ capita),” underscores the research. Charity begins at home, they say. Contradictions of middle class green action must be addressed by consuming much less, to scale, quickly."
" While global sea levels are rising due to the climate crisis and threatening near-coastal infrastructures, higher temperatures in other areas are having exactly the opposite effect. The water levels are falling and also causing massive problems. Although the consequences are equally serious, however, declining water levels are receiving less attention according to Matthias Prange, Thomas Wilke of the Justus Liebig University in Giessen, and Frank P. Wesselingh of the University of Utrecht and the Naturalis Biodiversity Center Leiden (the Netherlands). “The Caspian Sea can be viewed as representative of many other lakes in the world. Many people are not even aware that an inland lake is dramatically shrinking due to climate change, as our models indicate,” says Matthias Prange. The report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also failed to mention lakes, and disregarded the social, political, and economic consequences of global warming on the affected regions. “This has to change. We need more studies and a better understanding of the consequences of global warming in this region.” The goal must be to raise awareness of the consequences of climate change for inland seas and lakes so that appropriate strategies can be developed, including approaches for other large lakes and regions facing similar challenges. Because of its size (it is the largest lake in the world) and because of its relatively high salinity of about one per cent, which is about one-third of the salt concentration in the oceans, the Caspian has been named a ‘Sea’. Its largest inflow is the Volga River and it has no natural connection to the ocean. The water level is determined by the proportional influences of inflow, precipitation and evaporation. Global warming is causing increased evaporation, which results in a declining water level. The Caspian Sea is an important regional water reservoir and, despite its salt content, a biological and commercial centre. It is bounded by Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Azerbaijan and Russia. Depending on the degree of global warming in the future, the water level could fall by 9 to 18 meters during this century. “This would affect not only the biodiversity, various species, and habitats that would disappear. The economies of all the bordering countries would be impacted, including harbours, fisheries and fish farming.” For this reason, the authors argue that in the future the Caspian Sea should be used as an example in scientific research to assess the vulnerability of certain regions to falling water levels. Because no nation can solve the resulting conflicts alone, they propose a global task force to develop and coordinate strategies. The article suggests that “international climate funds” could offer a possibility for financing projects and adaptation measures if changes in the lake level are attributed to climate change.

" The Delhi forest department has sent a notice to the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) for constructing a 22-metre synthetic jogging track at Nehru Park, which is identified as a deemed forest by the forest department. Senior forest department officers who did not wish to be named said that the unauthorised construction will have to be removed failing which they would take legal action. Deputy conservator of forests (south division), Amit Anand, issued a notice to the NDMC on December 17 stating that Nehru Park is a deemed forest, which means that any non-forest activity, such as construction is not permitted and also in violation of the Forest Conservation Act (1980). The order has also cited a 1997 Supreme Court judgment that prohibits such activity in a deemed forest. The notice was issued following a complaint filed by environmentalist Bhavreen Kandhari on December 7, bringing the forest department’s attention to the violation. HT has seen a copy of the notice. NDMC, as a pilot project, created a 22-metre long synthetic jogging track in the park around seven months back. However, early this month the municipality started work on adding another 2.5 kms of this track citing “positive response from the public”. The work on this was underway and has been stopped after the civic agency received the notice. The notice issued to the NDMC read, “...Nehru Park is located within a ‘deemed forest’ and any non-forest activity, means the breaking up or clearing of any forest land or portion thereof for any purpose other than re-afforestation, is a violation of the Forest Conservation Act.” “...the NDMC is directed to furnish within 60 days of receiving the notice, why a complaint should not be filed in court,” the notice added. In Delhi’s context, “an area above 2.5 acre having a density of 100 trees per acre as well as stretches of along roads and drains having a length of one kilometre,”is considered a deemed forest. Any construction activities in such area requires permissions from the union ministry of environment, forest and climate change under FCA. Such work also requires the usual permissions under the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994. Nehru Park, which is located in the diplomatic enclave of Chanakyapuri, was inaugurated in February, 1965 by then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, and is spread across 80 acres. A senior forest department of the official said that it is mandated under the FCA act that the erring agency be given time to respond to the official notice. However, along with an official response, NDMC will also have to remove the tracks that have already been laid out. “Any activity that will disturb the ecology of a marked deemed forest is prohibited. Permissions need to be taken from the Centre and forest department for it. It is high time land-owning agencies such as NDMC are held responsible for their actions,” the official said. However, a senior NDMC official explained that the jogging track was constructed for the benefit of scores of walkers and joggers who visit the park through the day. The municipality had been receiving complaints of users getting hurt on the uneven surface of the park’s older albeit natural track. BM Mishra, secretary NDMC said the ecology of the park was not hampered in any way during the construction of these tracks. “Nehru Park is popular among walkers and many senior citizens come to walk here. There are stones, uneven surface and dusty patches in the existing track, which not only create problems for walkers, but also contribute to dust pollution in the area. By creating a synthetic track, we have tried to provide a better walking and jogging facility for users without disturbing any greenery in the park. We will examine the forest department notice and respond accordingly,” Mishra said. Environment lawyer, Aditya Prasad, said government agencies consider the environmental aspects before undertaking infrastructure development."
" More than 75% of India’s districts are hotspots of extreme climate events and are bearing the lethal effects of a rapidly-changing microclimate with loss of property, livelihoods and lives, according to a study by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW). The report notes that while India witnessed 250 extreme climate events between 1970 and 2005, the country recorded 310 extreme weather events after 2005. That India has been at the receiving end of the climate crisis is known. According to the Climate Risk Index, 2018, the country jumped nine places in climate vulnerability rankings, and was ranked the fifth-most climate-vulnerable country in the world. Storms are escalating into cyclones, droughts are affecting more than half the country, and floods of an unprecedented scale are causing catastrophic damage. The Centre has done well in treating climate as a priority issue — but the scale of the destruction of lives, livelihoods and critical infrastructure warrants more action."
" Before 2020 collapses under its own weight, it’s worth noting some of the positive things that came out of the year. A book that was published this fall, All We Can Save, is something that will help us navigate a nerve-wracking future. Against a backdrop of the trickling, everyday dross of internet life—not to mention destabilizing pandemic and populism around us—this book is what the late short-story author Raymond Carver might have called “a small good thing.” All We Can Save is a collection of essays, memories, poems, and even advice memos written by 60 women, most enmeshed professionally one way or another with climate change — scientists, researchers, activists, journalists, former government officials, writers, and more. A fine expression of the project comes in one of many interstitial quotations dropped in-between the short essays. It’s a statement from Heather McGhee, a political commentator, author, and board chair of the group Color of Change: “Inequality and climate change are the twin challenges of our time, and more democracy is the answer to both.” Readers of Bloomberg Green are used to climate change as a business, investment, policy, technology, or science story. All We Can Save complements that approach with something sorely missing: Shared interior monologues about the empathy that binds people to each other and to history. The contributions are each about what it feels like to be a descendant, child, mother, friend, colleague, leader, or ancestor at the onset of the what should probably be called obvious climate change. The book’s title comes from a line by the late poet Adrienne Rich: “My heart is moved by all I cannot save.” It’s refreshing to hear the expertise of, to cite one example, Indigenous people applied directly to modern questions of governing, business, agriculture, and more. The world’s largest companies have been tripping over each other for 15 years to claim the mantle of “sustainability,” when the oldest human communities have quietly been experts on it for millennia. “The great contribution that Indigenous peoples may be able to make at this time is to continue providing the world with living models of sustainability that are rooted in ancient wisdom,” writes Sherri Mitchell Weh’na Ha’mu Kwasset. Half a book later, Régine Clément, the head of Creo Syndicate, an investing group for rich families, bridges the old and new by asking, “How can we use the mechanics of capitalism as it currently exists to transform it?’ There are hat-tips to national politicians, any of which shrinks in substance to, say, former U.S. regional Environmental Protection Agency administrator Heather McTeer Toney’s account of how when doors close and meetings start, “there was no room for petty division.” There are a couple repetitions of names and ideas, which can be interpreted charitably as happy shoutouts to shared parts of a community. One contributor, former U.S. EPA administrator Gina McCarthy, was recently named to become President-elect Joe Biden’s national climate advisor. Books are finite, and even a work of 60 contributors running to 419 pages leaves out voices. Editors Ayana Elizabeth Johnson and Katharine Wilkinson, who respectively hold doctorates in marine biology, and geography and environment, have turned their book into an All We Can Save Project, with a new newsletter, to extend their ideas and work on behalf of women climate leaders. All We Can Save is basically a community bound between two covers, and a gift to any who wishes to join in. Johnson and Wilkinson have set a high bar, but this movement-forging book format is replicable by anyone else who also believes these two things: how modernity shouldn’t undo itself; and how it’s self-evident that all people are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, and that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

" Rising global health risks driven by climate change will hit the poorest, most vulnerable people the hardest - and failure to prepare for those threats will mean more deaths and suffering, according to a leading environmental health scientist. From impoverished families living in flood-prone homes to women whose cultures require them to stay covered in extreme heat, climate impacts on health have “a strong equity component”, said Kristie Ebi, a professor at the University of Washington’s Center for Health and the Global Environment. Besides hiking dangers from deadly heat and spreading diseases, climate change will fuel a rise in basic health problems - from diarrhoea to poor nutrition - that will affect the poor most and likely widen global inequalities, she said. “Future health risks will be determined not just by the hazards created by a changing climate but also by the sensitivity of individuals and communities exposed to these hazards,” she noted in an article published this month in the journal Health Affairs. Many of the biggest health concerns from climate change “boil down to maternal and child health issues”, said Ebi, who has helped countries plan how to adapt to climate-linked health threats from Africa and Asia to the Pacific and Central America. Children face particular risks, she said. Because they breathe in more air for their body size than adults, for instance, they are particularly susceptible to air pollution, such as from worsening global wildfires, she noted. “They handle it much more poorly than adults do,” Ebi told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview. High levels of child stunting and wasting, as extreme weather destroys crops and hits food security for many families, also will drive lasting health problems, she said. “Without sufficient food, brain development is affected. Children end up learning less and earning less,” said Ebi, who has led many national and international climate assessments. Health issues can feed on each other too, she said, with hunger increasing vulnerability to malaria and more frequent diarrhoea exacerbating malnourishment. Preparing health services for the coming threats will be crucial to avoid the worst impacts - but both richer and poorer countries are spending too little on that, she added. Globally, less than 0.5% of international climate finance goes to efforts to address climate-related health concerns, the journal article noted. The U.S. National Institutes of Health, for instance, spends under 1% of its research budget on climate issues, Ebi said. “It’s laughably small,” she said of global funding to research and deal with climate-related health concerns. Such limited funding means measures that could help stem worsening health risks - from better early warning systems to mental health support for those who suffer catastrophic losses - are not being put in place fast enough. Progress on tackling shifting health threats is also hampered because experts on related issues - from water and agriculture to nutrition and diseases - do not work together often enough, Ebi said. “We need people from different fields sitting together and solving problems,” she added. “The challenges the world is facing are interconnected.” (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.)"
" President-elect Joe Biden is scheduled to publicly introduce his climate and energy team on Saturday, a history-making group that will be tasked with advancing his ambitious climate policy and strengthening safeguards against pollution. Biden has promised to make tackling climate change one of the pillars of his Democratic administration. But with a slim majority in the US House of Representatives and control of the U.S. Senate still undecided, Biden and his new team may see little success in Congress and instead rely on rules from his regulatory agencies to enact sweeping change. The climate team will be formally introduced in Biden’s home state of Delaware on Saturday, during a press briefing where he’s expected to tease further details of his climate plan. The former Vice President to President Barack Obama tapped a familiar face, Obama’s US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator Gina McCarthy, to lead a newly-created position as national climate adviser tasked with implementing the domestic Biden agenda. Biden nominated Michael Regan, North Carolina’s top environmental regulator, to head up the EPA. Regan, who worked at the Washington-based agency during the Clinton and Bush administrations, has served as secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality since 2017. Democratic congresswoman Deb Haaland will serve as Biden’s interior secretary, and former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm as his energy secretary. The team also includes Brenda Mallory, an environmental lawyer, as chair of the Council on Environmental Quality and Ali Zaidi, a leading climate expert and Biden adviser, as deputy national climate adviser. If confirmed by the US Senate, Haaland would be the first Native American to hold a US cabinet post, Mallory would be the first African American to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality, and Regan would be the first Black man to run the EPA. The team has been largely praised by environmental groups for its experience and diversity. But the powerful fossil fuel industry, which Biden has frequently targeted for criticism, said the administration must balance its climate efforts with preserving jobs."
" Over 4.5 crore people will be forced to migrate from their homes in India by 2050 due to climate disasters including floods, droughts and cyclones, three times more than the present figures, according to a new report. In 2020, the number of people displaced in India is 1.4 crore, it said. The report  ‘Costs of climate inaction: displacement and distress migration’ assessed climate-fuelled displacement and migration across five South Asian countries -- Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- and calculates a devastating likelihood of over 6 crore people being homeless and displaced by 2050 in South Asia alone. It is based on a study conducted by International agencies ActionAid International and Climate Action Network South Asia. Quoting figures, the report claimed that 4.5 crore from India will be forced to migrate from their homes by 2050 due to climate disasters. “Political failure to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius as per the Paris agreement goal is already driving 18 million climate migrants from their homes in 2020,” the report said. The report released on Friday, estimates that climate migration will treble in South Asia alone, a region badly affected by climate disasters, including floods, droughts, typhoons and cyclones. The research was undertaken by Bryan Jones, one of the authors of the inaugural Groundswell Report on internal climate migration in 2018. The report called for strong leadership and ambition from developed countries to cut emissions and support for developing countries to adapt to climate change and recover from climate disasters.  It recommended a holistic approach that places the onus on rich countries to provide support and urges developing countries to scale up efforts to protect people from climate impacts. Harjeet Singh, Global Climate Lead at ActionAid, said, “We are facing melting glaciers in Nepal, rising seas in India and Bangladesh, cyclones and inhospitable temperatures. Climate change is increasingly forcing people to flee their homes in search of safety and new means to provide for their families. “Rich countries need to take greater responsibility to reduce their emissions and support South Asian countries in cutting emissions and dealing with climate impacts. The human cost of inaction is too high,” he said. The research reveals that in all five countries, women are left dealing with the negative fallout from climate migration. “They are left behind to take care of household chores, agricultural activities, look after children and elderly and manage livestock. Women who migrate to urban settlements are often then forced to take up work in precarious settings where workers’ rights violations are rife,” it said. Sanjay Vashist, Director, Climate Action Network South Asia said, “South Asia is geographically vulnerable to climate disasters and is regularly lashed with floods and cyclones, but poverty and environmental injustice are also determining factors in this climate migration crisis."
" US President-elect Joe Biden has announced his climate and energy team, which the transition said is ready on day one to advance his agenda and lead the world to confront the undeniable, accelerating and punishing reality of climate change. The nominees are Congresswoman Deb Haaland as Secretary of Interior, Jennifer Granholm as Energy Secretary, Michael Regan as administrator for Environmental Protection Agency and Brenda Mallory as Chair of the Council of the Council on Environmental Quality. Biden on Thursday also announced the appointment of Gina McCarthy as his National Climate Advisor and Ali Zaidi as his Deputy National Climate Advisor. Zaidi is the highest-ranking Pakistani-American appointed by Biden in his administration. “This brilliant, tested, trailblazing team will be ready on day one to confront the existential threat of climate change with a unified national response rooted in science and equity. They share my belief that we have no time to waste to confront the climate crisis, protect our air and drinking water, and deliver justice to communities that have long shouldered the burdens of environmental harms,” Biden said in a statement. “Together, on behalf of all Americans, they will meet this moment with the urgency it demands — and seize the opportunity to build back better with good-paying union jobs, climate-resilient infrastructure and a clean energy future that benefits every single community,” he said. Biden is scheduled to be inaugurated as the 46th US President on January 20. He has vowed to rejoin the Paris climate deal on the first day of his presidency. The Trump administration last month formally withdrew from the Paris accord, a decision originally announced three years ago. The deal committed the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures below 2C above pre-industrial levels and attempting to limit them even more, to a 1.5C rise. Trump argues that the agreement is disadvantageous for the US, while it gives benefits to countries like China, Russia and India. According to him, it could be economically detrimental and cost 2.5 million Americans their jobs by 2025. Observing that the undeniable, accelerating, punishing reality of climate change is exacting an incalculable toll on lives and livelihoods in every community across the country, the transition said the team knows that science demands they address climate change immediately and that the response must be grounded in science. The team will turn the climate crisis into an unprecedented opportunity to create millions of good paying union jobs in communities across the country; powering the economy with clean energy and positioning the US as an exporter of 21st century products; and making the economy stronger and more resilient. They will work closely with communities who bear the outsized burden of environmental injustice, including Tribal Nations and communities of colour, and young Americans who will live with the long-term consequences of climate change, the transition said. Haaland is currently serving as Vice Chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources. If confirmed, she will make history as the first-ever Native American Cabinet secretary. Granholm is a two-term Governor of Michigan whose work during and after her tenure has centred on creating clean energy jobs in America. Her leadership was instrumental in rescuing the US auto industry, saving one million jobs, and preparing Detroit for a clean energy future. Nominated to serve as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Regan is the current Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. He has served in the EPA under both Democratic and Republican presidents and has a distinguished track record of bringing people together across the public, private and non-profit sectors to advance environmental justice and seek solutions to environmental and climate challenges. An accomplished public servant and environmental lawyer, Mallory is former General Counsel to the Council on Environmental Quality and current Director of Regulatory Policy at the Southern Environmental Law Centre. If confirmed, she would be the first African American to hold the position since its creation more than half a century ago. McCarthy will serve as the first-ever National Climate Advisor, heading up the newly formed White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy, where she will drive an “all of government” approach to combating climate change. A leading voice on climate and environmental issues for more than 30 years, McCarthy was a driving force behind the Obama-Biden administration’s groundbreaking Clean Power Plan during her tenure as EPA Administrator. Zaidi, a leading climate expert and longtime advisor to the president-elect, will serve as Deputy National Climate Advisor. He had helped draft and implement the Obama-Biden Administration’s Climate Action Plan and negotiate the Paris accord. Zaidi immigrated from Pakistan and grew up in the Rust Belt outside Erie, Pennsylvania. “...our climate crisis is a grave and growing threat to the American people and the planet...President-elect Biden and I proposed one of the most ambitious climate plans in history. The team we are announcing today will help make that plan a reality,” Vice President-elect Kamala Harris said."
" The Supreme Court on Thursday said it was not satisfied by the work done by the commission for air quality management, constituted on November 5 under an ordinance promulgated in October, until now. The bench comprising Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde and justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said, “We are not satisfied.” So far, the commission said, it has been working on developing technology for emergency response and has involved several experts from the fields of engineering, meteorological department, advanced computing and environmental engineering. This is the first major decision taken by the commission. As the Supreme Court is monitoring air pollution in Delhi caused by stubble burning and other reasons, a bench headed by CJI Bobde sought to know the work done by the commission till date. Submitting an affidavit filed jointly by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) before the court, additional solicitor general (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati said, “The commission has started working in the right earnest.” The affidavit disclosed the new technology sought to be developed by the commission. “The commission is developing a Decision Support System (DSS) for an air quality emergency response activities involving resource persons from scientific institutions,” the affidavit said. These institutions include Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi (IIT-D), Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM-Pune), National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), The Energy and Resources Institution (TERI), and Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC). Regarding the steps the commission took to mitigate air pollution affecting Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), the commission said it had held a slew of review meetings with various agencies, governments of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and National Capital Territory of Delhi. In its first meeting held on November 10, five days after being constituted, the commission delegated the task of operationalising and monitoring the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) to CPCB till a mechanism is devised by the 18-member committee. Regarding the issue of stubble burning, the commission said that 50 teams have been deployed by CPCB to review the ground scenario. According to data furnished by the committee, the number of active farm fires in Punjab was 44% higher this year (September 21-November 25) with 76,590 stubble fires, compared to the same period last year when 52,991 fires were spotted by Punjab Remote Sensing Centre. Farm fires in Haryana saw a decline of 25% compared to last year. This year, the state reported 5,000 stubble burning incidents compared to 6,652 last year. The increase in stubble burning incidents notwithstanding, Delhi’s air has witnessed significant improvement compared to the past few years. The commission relied on the ambient air quality standards to show that in 2019, Delhi had 121 days and 63 days of ambient air quality for PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels. In 2018, the corresponding figures were 98 days and 48 days. The court was hearing a PIL filed by two environment activists, including Aditya Dubey. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the petitioners responded, “The stubble burning problem is over for this year but some concrete steps must be taken by the commission.”"
" The cold spell in Delhi further intensified on Thursday, as the maximum temperature dropped to 15.2 degrees Celsius, seven degrees below normal, which was exacerbated by fast icy winds blowing through the day, leaving city residents shivering. A departure of seven degrees from normal meant that the India Meteorological Department (IMD) categorised Thursday as a “severe cold day”. This was the fourth consecutive “cold” or “severe cold day”, with weather scientists predicting no relief over the weekend. Minimum temperature of the day was recorded around 8.30am on Thursday — 4.6 degrees Celsius, four degrees below normal. This means that the gap between maximum and minimum temperature on Thursday was only around 10 degrees Celsius. Scientists say temperature numbers alone are not able to capture the bitter chill most people are experiencing through the day because the “perception of the temperature” is likely even lower due to the icy cold winds. For example, the “feels like” temperature of Thursday’s minimum temperature is around two-to-three degrees Celsius. “The ‘feels like’ temperature is much lower because of the icy cold winds that are blowing at 15 to 20 kmph. We don’t expect relief from the bitter cold till December 21. A western disturbance is approaching around that time which will not have much impact on the plains. But the relief will be marginal, an increase of only one-to-two degrees Celsius,” explained Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, climate change and meteorology at Skymet Weather. The ‘feels like’ temperature takes into account wind speeds and humidity to assess how the human body actually feels temperature. “For example in winter a strong wind can feel much colder than the measured temperature would indicate. Conversely on a humid day in summer it can feel uncomfortably hotter than the air temperatures would suggest on their own,” explains the UK Met Office. Many stations in northwest India recorded extremely low minimum temperatures on Thursday — Churu recorded 2.2°C; Bikaner 3.1°C; Mt Abu -1°C; Sikar 0.5°C; Bareilly 3.3°C; Delhi Ridge 3.5°C; Narnaul 2.6°C; Ranichauri -1.4°C; and Gulmarg -11°C. Day temperatures were also unusually low — on Wednesday (maximum temperature data has been tabulated for Wednesday) Jammu recorded 14.4°C; Kathua 10; Keylong 3.3; Dalhousie 1.5; Amritsar 8.2; Bathinda 10; Hisar and Karnal at 15; Churu 16; Ganganagar 13.4. “Icy winds are blowing from the snow-clad mountains towards Delhi now. Around December 15 to 20 climatologically also we see a sharp fall in temperatures as sun rays are falling slightly slanted and not vertical. There is also uplifted fog in some regions over northwest India which is also not allowing the surface to warm up during the day. Overall the icy winds due to heavy snow cover over Himalayas are the primary driver for extremely cold days,” explained Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre. IMD had warned on Wednesday that “cold wave” to “severe cold” conditions may have a number of serious impacts on health that shouldn’t be ignored. There is an increased likelihood of various illnesses like flu, stuffy nose or nosebleed, shivering which is a first sign of the body losing heat. Prolonged exposure to extreme cold can cause frostbite, which leads to the skin turns pale, hard and numb and eventually black blisters appear on exposed body parts such as fingers, toes, nose and or earlobes. Severe frostbite needs immediate medical attention and treatment. The impact-based warning issued by IMD for cold wave recommends that people wear insulated shoes, moisturise skin, increase vitamin C intake, limit outdoor activities, maintain ventilation while using heaters, avoid drinking alcohol as it reduces body heat etc. Some of those exposed to dense fog could also suffer health impacts. Dense fog contains particulate matter and other pollutants which can get lodged in the lungs leading to episodes of wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath. Those with asthma and bronchitis are particularly vulnerable. According to IMD, a “cold day” or “severe cold day” is considered based on two parameters — a minimum temperature of under 10 degrees Celsius and maximum temperature that is 4.5 degrees Celsius or 6.4 degrees Celsius below normal respectively. A cold wave occurs in plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or is 4.5 notches lesser than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. Cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degree C in the plains. Witnessing a cold day and cold wave together means the gap between day and night temperatures was lower than normal. “Cold wave to severe cold wave” conditions are very likely in some pockets over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, West Uttar Pradesh and north Rajasthan during next three days and decrease thereafter according to IMD’s bulletin. “Cold day to severe cold day” conditions are likely in some pockets over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, north Rajasthan and northwest Uttar Pradesh during next two days and decrease thereafter. Dense fog is likely in some pockets over Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram during next three days."
" Brazil’s Amazon region has suffered more deforestation this year than any in the past decade. The lax environmental policies of President Jair Bolsonaro bear some of the blame; so, too, does climate change. But much can be laid at the feet of cattle farmers. Most cows in Brazil, the world’s largest beef exporter, are grass-fed. Ranchers in the precious biome use bulldozers, machetes, and fire to make room for pastureland—a practice that’s illegal but so widespread that it’s almost impossible for strapped regulatory teams to root out. A study published in Science in July showed at least 17% of beef shipments to the European Union from the Amazon region and Cerrado, Brazil’s savanna, may be linked to illegal forest destruction. The sheer size of the country’s beef industry—2.5 million ranchers, 2,500 slaughterhouses, and about 215 million heads of cattle spread across 3.3 million square miles (8.5 million square kilometers)—is one reason the big meatpackers say they’ve struggled to keep tabs on their suppliers. Another hurdle: Brazil’s government, which requires ranchers to file documents detailing the movements of their cattle, keeps that paperwork largely to itself. JBS SA, the global beef industry leader, vowed in September to start monitoring its indirect suppliers—i.e., the farmers who raise the cattle to sell to the folks who sell it to JBS. That followed a similar announcement months earlier from rival Marfrig Global Foods SA. Both set the same five-year deadline to bring transparency to their supply chains. But they’ve made such promises before to little effect. This time around they’re pitching a blockchain-based system that some worry will be as easy to manipulate as the current system. Here’s a rundown of where information gets lost. 1. The ranchers Brazil’s cattle ranches come in all shapes and sizes, from mom and pop farms that ship out calves as soon as they’re born to one-stop shops that breed, fatten, and finish cows all on their own. Cattle tagging (think of the microchip a veterinarian might slip under your dog’s skin) is already an established practice in large parts of the global food supply chain. For big farms it would be cheap to implement, costing about 0.5% of an animal’s revenue, according to a report from the Brazilian Coalition on Climate, Forests & Agriculture. Uruguay, a direct competitor to Brazil, was an early adopter in the Americas, making it possible to trace a single cow from birth to plate, says Erasmus zu Ermgassen, a sustainable livestock and supply chain researcher at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium. “It’s not rocket science,” he says. 2. The pastures and Feedlots Some cows spend their entire life on one ranch, but that’s pretty rare, says Holly Gibbs, an associate professor of geography and environmental studies at the University of Wisconsin. Cattle move two or three times on average, according to her research, and sometimes as many as six times before they’re slaughtered. That constant shuffling makes it all too easy to hide a cow’s real origin, a practice known as “cattle laundering.” Each time a cow is moved from one property to another, the state issues a guide to animal transport, or GTA, which identifies the shipping farm, the receiving farm, the number of cattle being moved, and the date of transfer. This process helps ensure the safety of the overall herd in the case of a disease outbreak, but deforestation fighters have also latched on to the documents as a potential key to traceability. Currently the only people who regularly get to see the GTAs are the ranchers, the drivers moving the cattle, and food sanitation officials. The government says making them more widely available would violate ranchers’ privacy rights, even as the secrecy helps bad actors evade the law. 3. The Direct Suppliers When JBS, Marfrig, and smaller rival Minerva SA say they’re confident they’re not contributing to the destruction of the Amazon rainforest, what they really mean—and what they acknowledge in sustainability reports—is that the suppliers they get their cattle from aren’t themselves involved in deforestation. But almost no direct suppliers actually breed and raise all the cattle they sell, Gibbs says. In its 2019 annual report, JBS announced that DNV-GL, a Norwegian social and environmental auditor, had confirmed that 100% of the cattle it acquired from the Amazon were compliant with zero-deforestation commitments made in 2009 among companies, public prosecutors, and groups such as Greenpeace. DNV-GL, which is no longer auditing JBS’s supply chain, later clarified in a letter to forest groups that it actually found “non-conformity” because the company didn’t have systems in place to trace its indirect suppliers. “JBS cannot use the assessment report as evidence of good practices throughout their total supply chain,” Brazil Area Manager Adriano Duarte wrote in the letter. JBS says it’s never claimed the audit referred to indirect suppliers, and that 100% of its direct cattle purchases are in line with environmental commitments. 4. The Slaughterhouses Brazil is a beef-producing powerhouse, slaughtering almost 32 million cattle per year, according to national statistics institute IBGE. JBS, Marfrig, and Minerva are the best-known names, but there are as many as 2,500 smaller butchers and meatpackers, according to Neoway, a big data and artificial intelligence company based in São Paulo. Relying on companies to police themselves and their suppliers is unrealistic; only the government can do that, through a universal monitoring system, says Raoni Rajão, a social sciences professor at the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Brazil. “There is no other actor able to solve this issue,” he says. Gilberto Tomazoni, JBS’s chief executive officer, holds a similar opinion. “If the entire sector isn’t engaged, Brazil will continue to have all the same problems,” he says. 5. The Consumers China—including the mainland and Hong Kong—is by far the biggest buyer of Brazilian beef, accounting for almost 60% of all foreign purchases from January to October, according to government data. Egypt, Chile, Russia, and Saudi Arabia round out the top five consumers. None of these has transparency requirements related to deforestation, Rajão says. Among the major importers, only the EU has talked about it. Brazil may be the world’s biggest beef exporter, but the locals are big meat eaters, too. Four-fifths of the almost 11 million tons the country processes each year go to the domestic market, says Abiec, Brazil’s beef exporter group. Consumers inside and outside Brazil, including supermarkets and restaurants, need to show their outrage more and refuse to buy Brazil’s beef until the system is cleaned up, says Paulo Barreto, a senior researcher at Imazon, a nonprofit focused on the Amazon. “This step is missing,” he says. Cattle cause more climate problems than deforestation. Methane—mostly released in burps—accounts for as much as 5% of total greenhouse gas emissions. If meatpackers can’t prove their steaks don’t come from cleared rainforest, their ability to account for supply chain emissions will remain a question mark.

" Governments have made little progress on greening Covid-19 stimulus packages, with spending in only seven of 25 major economies estimated to have a net positive impact for the climate and nature, researchers said on Thursday. An index, updated every few weeks by think-tanks Vivid Economics and Finance for Biodiversity, found far more recovery money has been earmarked for industries and activities that harm nature, compared with measures like planting trees or restoring wetlands. Overall, governments are funnelling an estimated $13 trillion into the world’s economies, to foster jobs and growth. Nearly a third of that is going to sectors that affect carbon emissions and biodiversity - energy, industry, waste management, transport and farming - but the researchers identified only $567 billion as green spending. “Our analysis of Covid-19 stimulus commitments to date suggests that investments are further entrenching unsustainable economic pathways, resulting in a high risk of stranded assets, accelerated climate change and continued depletion of natural capital,” said co-author Jeffrey Beyer of Vivid Economics. Nature and biodiversity have been particularly neglected, the report noted. In the stimulus packages analysed, including the European Union’s, funding for action to improve biodiversity and preserve ecosystems amounted to only about $108 billion so far, compared with $219 billion linked to pollution or habitat destruction. Some governments have announced new climate- and nature-friendly stimulus packages and policies, the analysis said, citing Canada, which moved from a net environmentally negative stimulus to net positive for the first time in December’s index. The country’s Fall Economic Statement committed $2.9 billion over the next 10 years to plant 2 billion trees and to enhance the carbon storage potential of wetlands, peatlands, grasslands and agricultural areas, it noted. Other examples of green stimulus measures include the European Union’s Covid-19 package, South Korea’s “New Deal” and Britain’s Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution, all of which mainly support clean energy production and use. Policy packages in Germany, Switzerland, Spain and France were also judged to be net-positive for the environment. Emerging economies most dependent on environmentally intensive sectors, such as mining and agriculture, and lacking strong regulatory oversight have the biggest task to turn their stimulus green - and have so far failed, the index found. They include China, India, Mexico, South Africa, Brazil and Indonesia, it added. Tools governments can use to green their stimulus efforts include corporate bailouts with conditions such as requiring airlines to shrink their carbon footprint, as well as investing in forest conservation and subsidising green products, the think-tanks said. They added that if governments allocated close to 5% of total stimulus to date into “nature-based solutions” like peatland restoration and sustainable farming they could create 7 million more jobs globally than sticking to business as usual."
" Hong Kong financial institutions and listed companies will have to disclose the financial impact of climate change on their businesses, as outlined in a major global standard, by 2025, the city’s main financial regulators said on Thursday. Investors in Hong Kong and around the world say uncertainty about the quality and comparability of companies’ climate-related disclosures limits their ability to make informed decisions. “We’re trying to create enough commonality and harmonisation to enable investors to be able to discriminate and compare,” Ashley Alder, chief executive of markets regulator the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said in an interview. The change is one aspect of a plan produced by a cross-agency group involving the SFC, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and government departments aimed at driving green initiatives in Hong Kong and helping the financial hub develop as a sustainable finance centre. “While Hong Kong as a geographical area is quite small ... our international financial centre footprint is huge. If you embed into that footprint the major components of climate finance as it develops, that is of global significance,” Alder said. Under the proposals, by 2025 companies will have to share information in line with standards set by the Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures (TCFD), a body created by the Financial Stability Board to publish principles to inform investors of climate-related financial risk. Alder said in some sectors such disclosures would become mandatory earlier. The TCFD said in October the level of disclosure by companies worldwide was inadequate. Hong Kong’s plan also says next year the city will adopt a common green finance taxonomy being developed by the European Union and China aimed at promoting the convergence of the two jurisdictions’ systems for assessing how environmentally-friendly companies are."
" Natural disasters like wildfires which devastated parts of the United States and a record number of hurricanes in the Atlantic caused $76 billion in insured losses during 2020, Swiss Re said on Tuesday. The 40% increase from $54 billion in 2019 dwarfed the $7 billion in man-made losses during 2020, the reinsurance company said in its sigma estimate for the year. The total insurance industry losses of $83 billion made 2020 the fifth costliest year since 1970, the company said. “Losses were driven by a record number of severe convective storms - thunderstorms with tornadoes, floods and hail - and wildfires in the U.S.,” Swiss Re said. In California, Oregon and Washington State, more than 800 wildfires burned close to 6 million acres, destroying thousands of structures and triggering billions in insured claims. The North Atlantic hurricane season brought 30 named storms, causing $20 billion in insurance claims, the company said. Five storms hit Louisiana alone, although most of the landfalls did not hit densely populated areas, reducing the total level of insured losses from the $97 billion level seen in 2017. Climate change is expected to worsen the number of such events, as humid air and rising temperatures create more extreme weather conditions, Swiss Re said. “As with Covid-19, climate change will be a huge test of global resilience,” said Jerome Jean Haegeli, Swiss Re Group Chief Economist. “But while Covid-19 has an expiry date, climate change does not, and failure to ‘green’ the global economic recovery now will increase costs for society in future.”"
" French President Emmanuel Macron announced a referendum to add the fight against climate change and the need to preserve the environment into the French Constitution. Speaking on Monday to a citizen’s group in charge of making proposals on climate-related issues, Macron proposed a change in the constitution that requires a parliamentary vote, and then a referendum. He acknowledged that France doesn’t do enough to be in line with its climate-related commitments aimed at curbing global warming. France is missing its national targets that had been set under the 2015 Paris Agreement and the country has delayed most of its efforts until after this year. “Should we do more? Yes,” Macron said in discussions that lasted about four hours with a panel of dozens of French citizens. European Union leaders, including Macron, agreed on Friday to beef up the continent’s 2030 targets to reduce greenhouse gases from 40 per cent to at least 55 per cent compared with 1990 levels. “We need to keep moving forward, and that work is even more urgent,” Macron said. U.S. President-elect Joe Biden pledged Saturday to rejoin the Paris climate accord on the first day of his presidency, as world leaders staged a virtual gathering to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the international pact aimed at curbing global warming.

" New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern defended her country’s climate change policies, saying that comments by activist Greta Thunberg suggesting the country lacked ambition referred only to part of New Zealand’s goals on climate change. Thunberg took to Twitter on December 13 to say that New Zealand’s “so-called climate emergency declaration” earlier in the month, committing the country to become carbon neutral by 2025, was “of course nothing unique to any nation”. Ardern on Monday told reporters she welcomed Thunberg’s contribution to the debate on climate, but said the emergency declaration covered only a portion of New Zealand’s climate change goals. “If it was the sum total of what we were doing, it would be worthy of criticism, it’s clearly not,” Ardern said, adding it’s “only a good thing that there are people out there continuing to urge ambition and action.” New Zealand declared a climate emergency on December 2, promising its public sector would achieve carbon neutrality by 2025. Its programme will be backed by a NZ$200 million ($142 million) fund to finance replacing coal boilers and help purchase electric or hybrid vehicles.

" A Regional Climate Centre for the Third Pole or the Hindukush Himalayan region will be established to conduct cutting-edge climate research, assessments and applications to forecast impacts of climate change on the Himalayas. A similar Regional Climate Centre is based in China. But the Centre in India, which is likely to be located in Delhi, will advise Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar too. “We are in initial stages of work with the World Meteorological Organisation and cannot provide an exact timeline for by when this Centre will come up. But it will soon be set up because the impacts of climate change will be pronounced on the entire on the Himalayan region,” said M Mohapatra, director general of the India Meteorological Department at TROPMET 2020, a symposium on meteorology organised by the Indian Meteorological Society. IMD is likely to have 10 weather radars for the Himalayan region in India by early next year and also an airborne lidar observation to measure glacier volume periodically. It will also expand the weather observation network in coming months. On Monday, scientists from IMD and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology cautioned that the impact of climate change on the Himalayas will increase in the form of cloudbursts, extremely heavy rain, landslides, glacial lake outburst flood (GLOFs) etc. “It is highly recognised by scientific community the world over that mountains play a dominant role in ecosystem and socioeconomic activity specially in the climate change scenario… considering the size and role of Himalayas in our hydrology, meteorology, ecology and socioeconomic issues, India has decided to facilitate research in the third pole region. A lot of initiatives have already been taken up by MoES for augmentation of observational network with deployment of weather radars and numerical weather modelling systems,” Mohapatra said, adding that climate change-led disasters are becoming more pronounced in the non-Himalayan mountain ranges. “Disasters play a dominant role in deciding which socioeconomic activities can be conducted in the region. Now we also have various disasters in Western and Eastern Ghats. In recent years we have seen due to heavy monsoonal rainfall how disastrous landslides, which were generally realised in the Himalayas or the north-eastern states, have been realised in Karnataka and Kerala. Similar landslides have also been realised when a super cyclone crossed Odisha in 2018 and the Eastern Ghats were impacted by landslides. There have been specific changes in the mountain ecology due to climate change. Being a data sparse region the observational network in the mountains is limited compared to other parts of the country so we have the scope to improve,” he added. The Hindu Kush Himalayas (HKH) experienced a temperature rise of about 1.3 degrees Celsius during 1951–2014 compared to India’s average temperature which has risen by around 0.7 degree C during 1901–2018, according to the “Assessment of Climate Change over the Indian Region,” a report published by the ministry of earth sciences earlier this year. Several areas of HKH have experienced a declining trend in snowfall and also retreat of glaciers in recent decades. In contrast, the high-elevation Karakoram Himalayas have experienced higher winter snowfall that has shielded the region from glacier shrinkage. By the end of the twenty-first century, the annual mean surface temperature over HKH is projected to increase by about 5.2 degrees C under a low action scenario, the report has projected."
           
" Global research points out that exposure to chronic air pollution increases chances of succumbing to Covid-19. Oxides of Nitrogen were one culprit. Remember, NOx can be both the uber dangerous PM2.5 in terms of size plus result in ozone when reacting with pollutants like Volatile Organic Compounds – found in some paints and for cleaning. Why bird feeding should stop Today is a good time to discuss the Covid-19 and air pollution link. It has been five years since the Paris Agreement, and we’ve lost a million lives, apart from losing the year. We’ve also seen it’s possible to control air pollution in India. If we didn’t have such high levels of air pollution, would fewer Indians have died of Covid-19? Possible, but let’s look ahead. In India, fuel and industries emit the most NOx. We must rejig our cities for more public transport and make it easier to use non-motorised transport. As far as industry goes, there is no option but to invest in clean production. Both sources are also significant contributors to climate change. Clearly, we know where the dreadful twain of air pollution and climate change meet.

" Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday pledged that by 2047, centennial India will exceed the world’s expectations in implementing actions to counter climate change. In his speech at the UN Climate Ambition Summit, he said that on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement - the most ambitious step in fight against climate change - the world shouldn’t lose sight of historical emissions. He called for a review of actions taken by all countries based on the commitments they had made under the agreement. “Today, as we are looking to set our sights even higher, we must also not lose sight of the past. We must not only revise our ambitions but also review our achievements against targets already set. Only then can our voices be credible for future generations. India is not only on track to achieve Paris targets but to exceed them beyond your expectations,” he said. Watch | ‘India on track to exceed Paris Agreement targets beyond expectations’: PM Modi   The prime minister added that “India has reduced its emission intensity by 21 per cent over 2005 levels. Our solar capacity has grown from 2.63 GigaWatts in 2014 to 36 GigaWatts in 2020. Our renewable energy capacity is the fourth largest in the world. It will reach 175 GigaWatts before 2022. And, we have an even more ambitious target now - 450 GigaWatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030.” Also read: ‘Use election-like process for Covid-19 vaccination drive’ - Centre tells states In his pledge, PM Modi said, “In 2047, India will celebrate 100 years as a modern, independent nation. To all my fellow residents of this planet, I make a solemn pledge today. Centennial India will not only meet its own targets but will also exceed your expectations.” The Climate Ambition Summit is hosted by the United Nations and the United Kingdom to mark the fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change which was adopted by 196 parties at 21st Conference of Parties in Paris, on December 12 2015, and entered into force on November 4, 2016. The important virtual summit being co-hosted by France in partnership with Chile and Italy will allow governments to present their commitment and compliance with the Paris Agreement. Ahead of the conference, India had underlined that it has been responsible to the commitments under the Paris Agreement but most of the developed world which is responsible for historical emissions hasn’t shown much progress. Financial commitment by developed countries to the tune of 11 trillion dollars to help the world mitigate and adapt to climate change hasn’t come through yet, Prakash Javadekar, Union environment minister had said on Friday. “Five years after Paris we are still not going in the right direction. Paris promised to limit global temperature which rose to as close to 1.5 degrees as possible. The commitments made under Paris were far from enough to get there and even now those commitments are not being met. Today, we are 1.2 degrees hotter than we were before the industrial revolution. If we don’t change course, we may be headed for a catastrophic temperature rise of more than 3 degrees C this century. Can we still deny we are facing a climate emergency?” UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres asked at the Summit. “We are not doomed to fail. Covid-19 recovery presents an opportunity to set our economies and societies on a green path… the members of G20 are spending 50 per cent or more of their stimulus on sectors linked to fossil fuel consumption than on low carbon energy. This is unacceptable. This is a moral test. We cannot use trillions of dollars needed for covid recovery to lock in policies that burden future generations with a mounting debt on a broken planet. So the central objective by 2021 is to build a truly global coalition for carbon neutrality by the middle of the century. To make it a reality we need meaningful cuts now,” Guterres added. The occasion was marked by some important announcements like UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said UK will provide 11.6 billion pounds of our overseas aid to support green technology.   I call on leaders worldwide to declare a State of Climate Emergency in their countries until carbon neutrality is reached.

" Thinning ice in the Arctic Ocean made this year’s navigation season for natural gas tankers the longest on record, the latest sign that the pace of climate change is accelerating in the Earth’s northernmost latitudes. The Northern Sea Route, stretching more than 3,000 nautical miles between the Barents Sea west of Russia and the Bering Strait in the country’s east, traditionally opens from June through October, when higher temperatures break up ice. This year, voyages started a month early and will continue until at least the end of December. Record warmth meant slower freezing during the autumn. “This year could potentially become a turning point for the Arctic,” said Samantha Burgess, deputy director at Europe’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. “This was a fairly exceptional year in that the warmer-than-average condition was incredibly persistent throughout the whole year.” The length of the shipping season in the Arctic is one of the most tangible signs that the region is warming more than twice as fast as the rest of the world. In a year that’s likely to rank among the three warmest on record—if not the hottest ever—it’s the Arctic that registered the most notable increases in what is emerging as an enormous climate-related disaster. Temperatures of more than 5 degrees Celsius above average for the first 10 months of 2020 fueled the most active wildfire season on record. High atmospheric temperatures led to an increase in water temperatures. Sea ice extent was the lowest on record for the month in July and October, and the second-lowest for most of the year. Thawing permafrost is threatening strategic oil, gas and civilian infrastructure in northern Russia, Canada and Alaska. What’s bad for the planet is an opportunity for the $100 billion-a-year liquefied natural gas industry, the quickest growing part of the fossil fuel business. To ship the fuel across an ocean or beyond where pipelines reach, the gas is chilled to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 160 Celsius) until it turns to a fluid. The trade in LNG cargoes has surged in recent years, boosting the stream of tankers moving the commodity from fields in Africa, the Middle East and Australia to lucrative markets mainly in Asia. Melting ice in the Arctic reduces shipping costs for cargoes that would otherwise have to transit the Suez Canal or the southern tip of Africa. To the west, the Barents and Kara Seas remained largely free of ice as late as November, according to Copernicus, the European Union’s climate satellite program. To the east, ice cover in the Chukchi Sea between Russia and Alaska has dropped by more than 45% since the late-1970s, according to Rick Thoman, a climate specialist at the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy. The longer the Northern Sea Route stays open, the more LNG cargoes can head directly to Asia, where it is consumed by industry and power generators in China, Japan and South Korea. Russia and the LNG industry are working to extend that shipping season, deploying the world’s biggest icebreaker starting in October to escort tankers for more months of the year. “Undoubtedly, such early and late navigation brings us closer to the implementation of one of the key goals of the Northern Sea Route development strategy—year-round navigation,” said the press office of Rosatom, Russia’s state-owned nuclear corporation in charge of managing the route. The nuclear-powered Arktika is capable of breaking through ice up to 2.9 meters thick (just under 10 feet), almost a third more than the current generation of ships in the Russian fleet. That will help Novatek PJSC move LNG cargoes to market from its giant fields on the Yamal peninsula in northern Russia. The Arktika will accompany ice-class LNG carriers to help make a path through this route and may enable a few journeys to Northeast Asia over December and through as late as April, consultants Energy Aspects Ltd. said in a note in November. This year’s extraordinary climate conditions have already allowed for a record number of voyages to Asia through the Northern Sea Route. About 30 will be made this season, five more than initially forecast, Mark Gyetvay, chief financial officer at Novatek said in November. That compares with 17 in 2019 and four in 2018. One last ship may finish the voyage through the Arctic route to Asia this month. For years, the gas industry and LNG exporters have promoted their fuel as a cleaner-burning alternative to coal. Novatek says its LNG plant is among the most efficient in the world, with some of the lowest carbon and methane emissions. It also uses tankers that burn LNG instead of ship oil, dramatically reducing pollution from its vessels. But while gas delivers lower carbon emissions than any other fossil fuel, policy makers worldwide are increasing their scrutiny of the business as they work toward slashing emissions that damage the atmosphere. The LNG industry’s success in the Arctic is a concern for scientists and environmental groups, who see a “feedback loop” with more ships speeding up the pace of warming in the region. The ice’s white surface reflects sunlight and helps cool the atmosphere. When it melts, it is replaced by ocean water, which is dark and absorbs solar radiation.  More shipping traffic in the Arctic also brings higher emissions of polluting gases, which can boost temperatures and soften ice packs locally, Burgess said. The presence of the tankers also increases the risk of accidents and spills in an area where biodiversity is fragile, she said."
" Any acceleration of inflation in the US next year could prove temporary as wage growth stays subdued, the pace of Asia’s economic recovery is seen differing by country and economists are skeptical of the sizable boost Japanese officials anticipate from their latest stimulus. Here are some of the charts that appeared on Bloomberg this week on the latest developments in the global economy: US While Americans are likely to see prices climb across a variety of sectors next year, thanks in part to Covid-19 vaccines that will potentially turbocharge services demand, one critical ingredient will be missing to sustain higher inflation: a tight labour market. Consumers are feeling more upbeat thanks to promising developments on a coronavirus vaccine. The University of Michigan’s measure of sentiment unexpectedly increased in early December, with a gauge of current conditions hitting the highest level since March. Europe Most Europeans want the economic recovery from the pandemic to promote growth that prevents climate change, the European Investment Bank found in a survey. A one-off 5% tax on wealth in the U. could raise more than 260 billion pounds ($348 billion) to help fix the coronavirus-hit public finances, according to a panel of experts. Asia Asia’s head start in the economic recovery from Covid-19 is sending a warning to the rest of the world: inequalities exacerbated by the virus are unlikely to be reversed any time soon. China’s consumer prices fell for the first time in more than a decade in November, dragged down by a slump in pork prices after supplies recovered from last year’s swine disease. Japan expects its latest stimulus package will boost the economy by 3.6%, but analysts warn that the number should be approached with caution. Emerging Markets Brazil’s central bank signaled it may be unable to fulfill its pledge to keep interest rates at a record low for long due to rising inflation expectations. South Africa’s economy may only get back to pre-Covid 19 levels by 2025 and remains vulnerable to a local resurgence of the pandemic, even after exiting its longest recession in 28 years. World Wall Street’s biggest banks are predicting the coronavirus-hit world economy will crawl through the early days of 2021 before bouncing back. Vaccines and more fiscal stimulus will help fuel an expansion after the unanticipated shock of the deepest recession since the Great Depression."
" The year 2020 teaches us that “super shocks” do not just come and go; they transform our ways of life. The climate crisis is another super shock, which will keep hitting harder going into the future. As we close out the pandemic year, the world’s largest polluters must pledge resources towards mitigating the climate super shock. That should be the metric to judge the Climate Ambition Summit on December 12. The United Nations (UN) Secretary-General said, recently, “Our planet is broken”. He promised that the UN’s goal for 2021 would be to build a global coalition around reducing emissions to net zero, by cutting greenhouse gas emissions or removing them from the atmosphere. He envisions a carbon price, eliminated fossil fuel subsidies, carbon taxes on polluters, and support for those already facing adverse impacts. The December 12 summit, on the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement on climate, is co-hosted by the United Kingdom (UK) presidency of the conference of the parties (COP-26, now scheduled for next year), the UN and France, in partnership with Chile and Italy. World leaders are expected to make major announcements on mitigation, adaptation and support. The prospect of more speeches hardly sounds encouraging in the backdrop of a rapidly-unfolding climate crisis. Summits serve three purposes. High-level participation allows leaders to negotiate knotty issues, building on personal rapport and the promise of grand bargains. Alternatively, leaders could set a new agenda, drawing others to their cause. This was why India and France promoted the International Solar Alliance in 2015. Further, heads of state/government could make unilateral announcements, baiting other countries to match in ambition. The 12/12 summit is primarily designed around the third objective. To that end, four kinds of announcements are expected: Upgraded Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement; long-term ambitions for net-zero emissions; commitments for more climate finance; plans and policies for adaptation. India, the only G20 country with NDCs consistent with a 2 degree Celsius goal, could legitimately ask, “Why should we upgrade NDCs when other major emitting countries should catch up with us?” Long-term ambitions are flaky. Thirty years ago, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change had not even been drafted. Since then, humanity has pumped out about 302.3 (±25.8) gigatonnes of carbon. With what crystal ball can the world hold countries accountable for their 2050 or 2060 net-zero targets? Moreover, the statements on December 12 will be made against the backdrop of the pandemic. Amid talk of building back better, governments must deliver on jobs, growth and sustainability. Fiscal resources are limited. Returns on investment on restarting growth and creating new jobs would have to be quicker than waiting three decades for net-zero emissions. As the capital of global finance, the UK has a chance to connect climate ambition with sustainable recovery by triggering a real effort at sustainable finance. Here are four ideas. First, make clean energy access a centre-piece of climate action. Energy poverty remains one of the key barriers to sustainable development. Access to distributed clean energy is also a route to energising small businesses in rural and urban settings. In India alone, there is a $50 billion market for using clean energy for productive enterprises in rural areas. In Sub-Saharan Africa, mobile money has helped to push the adoption of solar home systems. Now is the chance to bring together developing countries with a package that offers access to capital to finance such systems. With the potential to power labour-intensive businesses, this will signal that high-level summits have the interests of common people in mind. Second, help small and medium industries become more energy-efficient. Again, lack of access to clean fuels or regular electricity supply means that often polluting (and more expensive) fuels are used. These make small industries uncompetitive, a double whammy for the economy and the environment. Energy-efficient production processes need access to cheap working capital so that businesses can pay off the higher upfront costs for efficient equipment against their lifetime savings. This is not rocket science but needs dedicated attention from the financial industry. Third, aggregate clean energy projects across developing countries via a common risk mitigation mechanism to reduce the cost of finance. Financing costs are the largest component in the levelised cost of electricity in developing countries. Bundling non-project (macro, offtaker and political) risks and bundling projects for clean energy and sustainable transportation could increase their creditworthiness. It could also standardise investments across countries, thereby helping to scale up bond market capital flows into regions with growing energy demand. Fourth, fund the measures that can increase resilience against climate shocks. According to Swiss Re, economic losses from natural catastrophes and man-made disasters in 2019 were $146 billion. But the insurance industry covered only $60 billion. A global risk pooling reserve fund could combine climate risks across countries to spread them and ensure a payout when climate disasters above severe thresholds strike. Plans to build resilience will be worth little if the most vulnerable countries and communities have no insurance cushion against climate-induced loss and damage."
" Five years on from the Paris Agreement on climate change, the world remains in denial over the actions needed to prevent catastrophic warming, Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg said on Friday. The deal was adopted on December 12, 2015 by 196 countries but, so far, global leaders have failed to deliver on its promises, she said in a video that urged her 10.5 million Instagram followers to #FightFor1point5. That w as a reference to the ambition set out in the accord to hold the rise in average global temperatures to 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The video showed images of politicians and bureaucrats hugging and cheering when the Paris Agreement was signed. Yet the five years subsequent years have been the hottest years ever recorded, Thunberg said in the video, which mixed her sober address to camera with dystopian images of fire and flooding. Pledges so far to reduce greenhouse gas emissions put the world on track for a dire 3C or more of warming this century, with countries planning to produce double the amount of fossil fuels needed to hit the 1.5C target in the next decade alone, the United Nations and research groups said last week. “Hypothetical targets are being set and big speeches are being given, yet when it comes to the immediate action we need, we are still in state of complete denial,” Thunberg said. “We are still speeding in the wrong direction.” Now 17, Thunberg rose to fame in 2018 when her school strike for climate change campaign became a viral sensation online, turning her lone protest into a global movement. Since then she has become a thorn in the side of the world’s political elite. She ended Friday’s video on an optimistic note, saying the solution was in making people - rather than simply policymakers - aware of the extent of the climate crisis."
" European Union leaders reached a hard-fought deal Friday to cut the bloc’s net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by the end of the decade compared with 1990 levels, avoiding a hugely embarrassing deadlock ahead of a UN climate meeting this weekend. Following night-long discussions at their two-day summit in Brussels, the 27 member states approved the EU executive commission’s proposal to toughen the bloc’s intermediate target on the way to climate neutrality by mid-century, after a group of reluctant, coal-reliant countries finally agreed to support the improved goal. “Europe is the leader in the fight against climate change,” tweeted EU Council president Charles Michel as daylight broke over the EU capital city. “We decided to cut our greenhouse gas emissions of at least 55% by 2030.” Five years after the Paris agreement, the EU wants to be a leader in the fight against global warming. Yet the bloc’s heads of state and government were unable to agree on the new target the last time they met in October, mainly because of financial concerns by eastern nations seeking more clarity about how to fund and handle the green transition. But the long-awaited deal on a massive long-term budget and coronavirus recovery clinched Thursday by EU leaders swung the momentum. Large swaths of the record-high 1.82 trillion-euro package are set to pour into programs and investments designed to help the member states, regions and sectors particularly affected by the green transition, which are in need of a deep economic and social transformation. EU leaders have agreed that 30% of the package should be used to support the transition. Still, agreeing on common language was not an easy task. Negotiations were punctuated throughout the night by intense discussions in the plenary session and multiple chats in smaller groups on the sidelines. Another delay in revising the EU’s current 40% emission cuts objective for 2030 would have been particularly embarrassing before the virtual Climate Ambition Summit marking five years since the Paris deal, and leaders worked to the wire to seal a deal. The event on Saturday will be co-hosted by the UK with the United Nations and France. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week he wants the UK to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68% from 1990 levels by 2030 — a more ambitious goal than the EU’s. Poland, which last year didn’t commit to the EU’s 2050 climate neutrality goal, and other eastern countries, including the Czech Republic and Hungary, largely depend on coal for their energy needs. They considered it unfair that all member states should be submitted to the same ambition without considering their respective energy mixes. To win their approval, member states agreed that the new target should be delivered collectively. According to the Belgian Prime minister’s office, “leaders agreed that the cuts will be first achieved in sectors and countries where there is still plenty of room for improvement.” In addition, the European Commission will take into account specific national situations when drawing up the measures. A progress report will be submitted to the European Council in the spring. The accord also left the door open to member states to use gas or nuclear power as they drop fossil fuels. EU leaders agreed last year that nuclear energy would be part of the bloc’s solution to making its economy carbon neutral, and they reiterated Friday that they would respect member states’ rights to decide on their energy mix and to choose the most appropriate technologies to reach the goal. According to a French official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the meeting, Poland also obtained guarantees that the EU’s Emissions Trading System — a cap-and-trade scheme for industries to buy carbon credits covering about 40% of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions — would be revamped. Poland wants the reform of the system to redirect more revenues to the poorer EU countries. World leaders agreed five years ago in Paris to keep the global warming increase to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) by the end of the century. Under the Paris accord, countries are required to submit updated climate targets by the end of this year. Greenpeace and other environmental groups have said the improved EU target is insufficient to properly tackle climate change. “To increase the chances of limiting global heating to 1.5°C and avoid the worst effects of climate breakdown, Greenpeace is calling for at least a 65% cut in EU emissions from polluting sectors by 2030,” the NGO said. Climate Action Network Europe regretted that the revised “net” target includes carbon sinks like reforestation, meaning that emitting sectors will need to decarbonize less to reach the new goal. “As the Commission indicates itself in its 2030 Climate Target Plan, if the EU is successful in implementing the Commission’s biodiversity, carbon removals could represent up to 5% of emissions. In this case the real emissions reduction target would be as low as 50%,” the NGO said."
" India is not historically responsible for climate change, but India is taking steps to reduce emission as a responsible country, environment minister Prakash Javadekar said on the eve of the fifth year of Paris Climate agreement. “Climate change isn’t an overnight phenomenon. It has taken the last 100 years. Historically the USA has 25% of all emissions, Europe has 22% whereas China has 13% and India, only 3%. We are in no way responsible for this climate change,” Javadekar said. Paris Climate Agreement was adopted on December 12, 2015, by 196 parties. It became effective from November 4, 2016."
" A locked-down pandemic-struck world cut its carbon dioxide emissions this year by 7%, the biggest drop ever, new preliminary figures show. The Global Carbon Project, an authoritative group of dozens of international scientists who track emissions, calculated that the world will have put 37 billion U.S. tons (34 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide in the air in 2020. That’s down from 40.1 billion US tons (36.4 billion metric tons) in 2019, according a study published Thursday in the journal Earth System Science Data. Scientists say this drop is chiefly because people are staying home, traveling less by car and plane, and that emissions are expected to jump back up after the pandemic ends. Ground transportation makes up about one-fifth of emissions of carbon dioxide, the chief man-made heat-trapping gas. “Of course, lockdown is absolutely no the way to tackle climate change,” said study co-author Corinne LeQuere, a climate scientist at the University of East Anglia. The same group of scientists months ago predicted emission drops of 4% to 7%, depending on the progression of COVID-19. A second coronavirus wave and continued travel reductions pushed the decrease to 7%, LeQuere said. Emissions dropped 12% in the United States and 11% in Europe, but only 1.7% in China. That’s because China had an earlier lockdown with less of a second wave. Also China’s emissions are more industrial based than other countries and its industry was less affected than transportation, LeQuere said. The calculations — based on reports detailing energy use, industrial production and daily mobility counts — were praised as accurate by outside scientists. Even with the drop in 2020, the world on average put 1,185 tons (1,075 metric tons) of carbon dioxide into the air every second. Final figures for 2019 published in the same study show that from 2018 to 2019 emissions of the main man-made heat-trapping gas increased only 0.1%, much smaller than annual jumps of around 3% a decade or two ago. Even with emissions expected to rise after the pandemic, scientists are wondering if 2019 be the peak of carbon pollution, LeQuere said. “We are certainly very close to an emissions peak, if we can keep the global community together,” said United Nations Development Director Achim Steiner. Chris Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, thinks emissions will increase after the pandemic, but said “I am optimistic that we have, as a society learned some lessons that may help decrease emissions in the future.”"
" Climate change and its variability pose a serious threat to biodiversity and its conservation. To tackle this glaring problem, The Habitats Trust was founded in 2018 by Roshni Nadar Malhotra, Chairperson of HCL Technologies, and her husband, Shikhar Malhotra, Vice Chairman and CEO of HCL Healthcare. The two trustees of the Shiv Nadar Foundation are passionate about wildlife and its conservation, and set up the Trust to support conservation initiatives that tackle the threats to the lesser-known wildlife and habitats of India. Through various initiatives, The Habitats Trust works to empower on-ground conservationists and organisations in India. One such endeavour is The Habitats Trust Grants, an annual initiative which supports organisations and individuals dedicatedly working towards securing the country’s vibrant biodiversity. While there is extensive research and conservation attention accorded to charismatic species such as tigers, rhinoceroses and elephants, there remains an urgent need to support conservation for species and habitats that are not well-known as well, for example, the critically endangered great Indian bustard, or the Indian pangolin. The Habitats Trust Grants received over 4,300 registrations in 2020. The recipients of the Grants were evaluated based on various parameters, including the expected impact, relevance, and scalability of the project, and also the long-term sustainability of the proposed work after the one-year period. The four grant recipients – one each category, were selected by an eminent jury comprising of Ms. Bahar Dutt, wildlife biologist, author and environmental journalist; Mr. Brian Heath, Founder and CEO of the Mara Triangle Conservation Area, Kenya; Dr. M. K Ranjitsinh, wildlife expert and the prime architect of the Wild Life (Protection) Act of 1972; and Ms. Roshni Nadar Malhotra, Chairperson of HCL Technologies, Founder and Trustee of The Habitats Trust. Recipients of The Habitats Trust Grants 2020 The Strategic Partnership Grant, worth ₹25 lakh, was awarded to The Corbett Foundation for the ‘Conservation and Recovery of the Great Indian Bustard in Kutch’. This grant reaches out to mid to large-sized field work oriented organisations, in order to foster a two-way partnership for the common cause of conservation. The population of the critically endangered great Indian bustard in Rann of Kutch has declined over the years, with only a handful of birds remaining in this region. Threats like habitat degradation and collision with power lines have driven this bird to the brink of extinction. The Corbett Foundation has been working towards habitat restoration in this region, and plans to further scale their efforts by adopting a holistic approach to conservation. There’s also the Lesser-known Habitats Grant, which is open to organisations working to secure and regenerate the overlooked and unaddressed habitats of the country. This grant worth ₹20 lakh was awarded to SEEDS Trust for ‘Conserving the Ayyalur Habitat in the Eastern Ghats, and its Biodiversity’. The Ayyalur forests are mostly made up of dry deciduous and scrub jungle vegetation. Wild animals like the gray slender loris, and many other endemic and endangered species call these forests home, but they are constantly living under threat, due to the degradation of their habitat. With this project, SEEDS Trust looks to streamline conservation efforts towards sustainable regeneration of the habitat. In conjunction with this is the Lesser-known Species Grant, worth ₹15 lakh, which has been awarded to Bat Conservation India Trust for ‘Research and Conservation to Prevent Extinction of the Kolar leaf-nosed bat’. This unique species is found in a single cave in Karnataka, and is severely threatened due to habitat loss from land use change, hunting, and stone quarrying in the region. Bats have also been falsely linked to the coronavirus pandemic, necessitating the urgent need for conservation work on the species. Lastly, the Conservation Hero Grant, at ₹10 lakh, was awarded to M. Suraj for his project ‘Anti-snare Walks in Protected Areas of Chhattisgarh to Curb Poaching’. A mechanical engineer by training, Suraj has been working towards preserving natural habitats for over a decade now, in his home state of Chhattisgarh. He will use the support from The Habitats Trust to scale up efforts to curb poaching and hunting through anti-snare walks, and will also develop strategies to sensitise local communities about conservation efforts. The other finalists were also awarded 10 percent of the grant value in their respective categories in support of their conservation efforts. The total grant amount awarded by The Habitats Trust Grants 2020 is Rs. 84 lakh."
" Laurent Fabius, the Frenchman who brought down the gavel to seal the Paris Accord on climate change five years ago, said he wished world powers had fought global warming as resolutely as they have confronted the coronavirus pandemic. The agreement between almost 200 states on Dec. 12, 2015 was hailed as a potential turning point in efforts to contain global warming. It called for holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. While the long-term trend in global temperatures is now downwards, progress is insufficient, Fabius said, blaming a lack of political will among many governments, not least the United States under President Donald Trump. However, in an interview with Reuters, he highlighted some positive developments, including President-elect Joe Biden’s pledge to bring the United States back into the accord. Governments have taken courageous financial and social decisions to halt the virus, but climate change poses an even graver threat, Fabius said. “Unfortunately, we are not doing as much to fight climate change as we are to tackle the fallout from Covid,” said Fabius, who was chief negotiator at the Paris talks and is now president of France’s Constitutional Council. He said it was critical that in the global recovery from the pandemic, the rebound is “green” and money is not ploughed into old, polluting industries. The accord has brought some success, Fabius said. Scientific models had projected temperatures would increase 5 or 6 degrees and now estimated rises of 3 to 4 degrees by 2100. But this was still too high, he said. The thresholds set by the Paris Accord reflect scientists’ beliefs that a rise in temperatures of more than 2 degrees would doom the planet to a future of rising sea levels, catastrophic floods, droughts and storms, and food and water shortages. BIDEN: A GAME-CHANGER? Fabius, a former prime minister who was France’s foreign minister at the time of the accord, recalled sleepless nights during two weeks of intense negotiations. The accord almost fell apart at the last moment. He has a cherished replica of the green wooden hammer: cheers erupted and diplomats hugged as his gavel came down. “Since then, it’s not been the same. In particular there was the backtracking by US President Donald Trump, which was bad for America but more so the rest of the world,” he said. The United States, the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter after China, formally exited the accord on Nov. 4, a day after Election Day, fulfilling a Trump promise to withdraw. “A certain number of countries said to themselves: if the world’s biggest power doesn’t respect its commitments, why should we?” Fabius continued. But he said there had been a geopolitical shift in recent months. Biden has promised to rejoin the accord, China has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2060 and Japan by 2050. Fabius predicted that Biden’s task will not be easy, with control of the US Senate still up for grabs and energy lobby groups wielding huge influence in Washington."
" Five years after the Paris agreement, the European Union’s climate credentials will be put to the test as the bloc’s leaders meet Thursday to try and seal an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by the end of the decade compared to 1990 levels. The EU wants to be a leader in the fight against global warming. But the bloc’s heads of states and governments were unable to agree on the new target the last time they met in October, mainly because of financial concerns among eastern countries about how to fund the green transition. But now that the bloc’s leaders are ready to sign off on the EU’s next long-term budget and coronavirus recovery package, the record-high 1.82 trillion-euro package should help secure all 27 member states’ commitment to the improved target proposed by the commission, the EU’s executive arm. Large swaths of the budget and recovery aid are set to pour into programs and investments designed to help the member states, regions and sectors particularly affected by the green transition, which are in need of a deep economic and social transformation. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said she wants 37% of the 750 billion euros in the coronavirus recovery fund to be given to EU countries to spend on environmental objectives, while 30% of the bloc’s regular budget should be used for tackling climate change. Poland, which last year didn’t commit to the EU’s 2050 climate neutrality goal, and other eastern countries, including the Czech Republic and Hungary, largely depend on coal for much of their energy needs. They consider it unfair that all member states should be submitted to the same ambition without taking into consideration their respective energy mixes. László Palkovics, the Hungarian minister for innovation, told local media before the summit that his country was planning to propose a target of a 40% cut in emissions for all member states by 2030, with the remaining 15% to be assumed by the EU as a whole. According to draft conclusions of the summit, member states should agree that the new target “will be delivered collectively by the EU in the most cost-effective manner possible. All Member States will participate in this effort, taking into account considerations of fairness and solidarity, while leaving no one behind.” World leaders agreed five years ago in Paris to keep the global warming increase to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) by the end of the century. Under the Paris accord, countries are required to submit updated climate targets by the end of this year. Another delay in revising the EU’s current 40% emission cuts objective for 2030 would also be particularly embarrassing before the virtual Climate Ambition Summit marking five years since the Paris deal. The event on Saturday will be co-hosted by the UK with the United Nations and France. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week he wants the UK to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68% from 1990 levels by 2030 — a more ambitious goal than the EU’s. “It’s time for European leaders to deliver,” said ecological activist Adelaïde Charlier, a co-founder of Youth for Climate Belgium. “It’s crucial for the EU if they want to stay leaders, they really have to step up their game.” Greenpeace and other environmental groups have said the improved EU target is insufficient to properly tackle climate change."
" The World Bank said on Wednesday it was setting a new five-year target for 35% of its financing, on average, to have climate “co-benefits,” up from a 28% target for the previous five-year period ended in 2020. The multilateral development lender also said half of the climate-related financing would be done by its main units - the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Development Association - and would be aimed at supporting climate adaptation and resilience projects. “Climate change presents critical challenges to our development efforts,” World Bank President David Malpass, a former Trump administration Treasury official, said in a statement.

" Greenhouse gas emissions reached a new high last year, putting the world on track for an average temperature rise of 3 degrees Celsius, a UN report showed on Wednesday. The report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) - the latest to suggest the world is hurtling toward extreme climate change - follows a year of sobering weather extremes, including rapid ice loss in the Arctic as well as record heat waves and wildfires in Siberia and the US West. On Monday, researchers at Europe’s Copernicus Climate Change Service said last month was the hottest-ever November on record. “The year 2020 is on course to be one of the warmest on record, while wildfires, storms and droughts continue to wreak havoc,” said Inger Andersen, UNEP’s Executive Director. The annual “emissions gap” report measures the gap between anticipated emissions and those consistent with limiting the global temperature rise this century as agreed in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Under the global climate pact, nations have committed to a long-term goal of limiting the average temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it even further to 1.5C. Also Read | UK energy networks given 20% more to spend on net zero goal Emissions have, however, grown by an average 1.4 percent per year since 2010, with a steeper increase of 2.6 percent last year due, partly due to a large increase in forest fires. Total 2019 emissions of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) hit a new record of 59.1 gigatonnes. This year, there has been a temporary emissions dip as economies slowed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The resulting drop in travel, industrial activity and electricity generation are likely to work out at a 7% reduction in emissions, the report said. That translates to only a 0.01C reduction in global warming by 2050. Green investment under government stimulus packages to pull economies out of the pandemic-induced slump could cut up to 25% off emissions predicted in 2030. Such packages could put emissions in 2030 at 44 GtCO2e - within the range that gives a 66% chance of holding temperature rises to below 2C, but still insufficient to achieve the 1.5C goal. The United Nations and Britain are holding an online event on Saturday to mark the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement, and governments are under pressure to come forward with tougher climate targets before the end of the year. A growing number of countries have committed to net zero emissions by mid-century but these need to be translated into strong near-term policies and action, the UNEP report said."
" Deforestation in the Amazon destroyed an area bigger than Spain from 2000 to 2018, wiping out eight percent of the world’s largest rainforest, according to a study released Tuesday. The Amazon plays a vital role in curbing climate change, but destruction of the rainforest has only accelerated in recent years, found the study by the Amazon Geo-Referenced Socio-Environmental Information Network (RAISG). Since the turn of the millennium, 513,016 square kilometers (198,077 square miles) of the rainforest have been lost, according to the updated Amazon atlas produced by the organization, a consortium of groups from across the region. It is RAISG’s first such atlas since 2012. “The Amazon is far more threatened than it was eight years ago,” RAISG said in a statement. The consortium found that after making gains against deforestation early in the century, the Amazon region has again slipped into a worrying cycle of destruction. Deforestation hit a high of 49,240 square kilometers of forest loss in 2003 -- a record for this century -- then eased to a low of 17,674 square kilometers in 2010, the report said. But the destruction has since surged to startling levels. “Deforestation has accelerated since 2012. The annual area lost tripled from 2015 to 2018,” the study found. “In 2018 alone, 31,269 square kilometers of forest were destroyed across the Amazon region, the worst annual deforestation since 2003.” The destruction is fueled by logging, farming, ranching, mining and infrastructure projects on formerly pristine forest land. “The statistics presented by RAISG are an alarm bell on the increasing pressures and threats facing the region,” said researcher Julia Jacomini of the Socioenvironmental Institute (ISA), a Brazilian environmental group that is part of RAISG. The atlas “shows the importance of building an alliance of Amazon countries, which is non-existent at the moment, to fight those growing pressures and threats,” she told AFP. - World problem - The report comes as world leaders prepare for a virtual summit this weekend aimed at breathing new life into the 2015 Paris climate accord, whose goals on slowing the warming of the planet are currently set to be missed. Forests such as the Amazon play a vital role in controlling climate change because they absorb carbon from the atmosphere.            "
" Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi recently told a conference of global renewable energy investors hosted by India that the country’s renewable energy capacity would reach 220 gigawatts (GW) within two years. He said he planned to reach 450GW by 2030. The largest supply of renewable energy is to be provided by the sun, with wind coming a poor second. India has plenty of sun and these targets, although ambitious, are achievable. The initial target by the government of 20GW by 2022 was achieved four years ahead of schedule. But there are problems which India still has to overcome. There are also traps India might fall into if it concentrates so hard on solar and wind energy that it ignores all the other measures that need to be taken to curb the climate crisis. Land is a major problem the solar industry is facing. In Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala, there are protests over the acquisition of land where solar parks are either under construction or planned. In Rajasthan, Adani Green, reported to be the largest solar power generator in the world, had to stop work on the Fatehgarh Mega Solar Park spread over 989 hectares because of a court stay order. Two sets of villagers had filed petitions saying they were dependent on the land. The local authorities have claimed the land is owned by the government and the villagers are encroachers because they have no papers. The American bank, Goldman Sachs, is as optimistic about renewable energy as the Indian PM. The bank maintains that in 2021 investment in renewable energy will, for the first time, surpass spending on traditional fuel sources like oil and gas. Explaining its optimism, Goldman Sachs says, “Green technologies are now mature enough to be deployed at scale.” But it also says that “an attractive regulatory framework is needed”. What is an attractive framework for the solar industry is not necessarily going to be acceptable to India’s environmental movement. Solar energy development also raises environmental issues. For instance, the disposal of material hazardous to the environment. Unless the government insists on green energy generators disposing of photovoltaic cells safely, India could accumulate 1.88 million tonnes of hazardous waste, according to the engineering consultants, Bridge to India. The lack of solar cells and modules manufacturing capacity is another problem. Although India has had a ministry for promoting unconventional energy for almost 30 years, it still imports 90% of its solar cells and modules. The excuse for this has been competition from cheap Chinese imports. Gautam Adani, chairman of the Adani group, said the investment he intends to make in manufacturing cells and modules will develop ecosystems in the solar industry in the way Maruti had developed them in the small car manufacturing industry. By concentrating so much on solar and wind energy, there is a risk of the government falling into the trap of thinking that we can rely on these alone to control the climate crisis. We can’t. We still need to reduce the demand for energy and increase the efficiency of the way we use it. Funding for research into other growing alternative energy technologies such as clean hydrogen should continue. The search for satisfactory carbon marketing also needs to go on. Then there must be far more effective measures to preserve forests and protect rivers."
" The Goa government should consider imposing a green tax on tourism on the lines of taxes being imposed in countries like the Maldives and Spain, to help fund climate change mitigation measures, Goa’s Action Plan for Climate Change has recommended. The draft document that has been put together by the Goa State Biodiversity Board forecasts that Goa could lose as much as 7% of its area to rise of only one metre in the sea level, causing damage to the tune of ₹8,100 crore. “Tourism is a major industrial sector in Goa. Every year, tourists visiting Goa are almost four to five times the population of the state. Eco-tax or Green tax to combat climate change is proposed to assist in mitigation and adaptation activities of the areas which are most frequently visited by tourists. Such taxation models are under implementation in countries like Spain,” the document has noted. “The system can be developed based on the tourist’s standard of accommodation. As a next step, the institutional structure would need to be established to develop a functional model for taxation and its appropriate utilisation,” the report has said, suggesting that an appropriate mechanism, time frame and other modalities need to be worked out by the tourism department. The report, quoting United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) projections, has said that Goa stands to lose a large percentage of its land area, including many of its famous beaches and tourist infrastructure, which are very significant to states’ socio-economic status. “A one-metre rise in sea level, it is estimated, will affect 7 percent of Goa’s population and cause damage to the tune of ₹8,100 crore,” the report said, adding that it was essential to understand the vulnerability of different parts of the 105km long coastline of Goa. Also Read: AAP Goa unit’s ex convener, general secretary quit, allege party now compromised The report has noted that Goa and its surrounding region has witnessed warming trends much faster than the rest of the country, having already witnessed a 1°C rise in mean temperature over the period 1901-2018, with the warming accelerating after the 1970s. It also shows that the mean annual rainfall in Goa has increased by about 68% over the last century. Climate change projections in Goa in the 21st century, based on high resolution regional climate models (RCPs), have indicated that for a projected atmospheric CO2 concentration of up to 940ppm by 2100, Goa’s temperature will rise by 4.5°C compared to the base of 1901-1950; while in the less threatening scenario of atmospheric CO2 concentration of 538 ppm by 2100, Goa will witness a mean temperature rise of about 2.5°C compared to 1901-1950 base."
" The price of European Union carbon emissions hit 30 euros a metric ton for the second time this week as traders prepare for stricter measures from the bloc to address climate change. Breaching the 30-euro mark is seen as a key trigger that could usher in a new era for the pollution market, as Europe looks to speed up its decarbonization plans and reach net zero by 2050. Next week the EU leaders will gather for a summit to potentially agree an emissions plan that could push carbon through a 14 year high. Carbon has hit this price range twice before this year, in July and September, before falling back down. Each time the surge has been driven by market expectations about the EU’s climate plans. EU leaders are expected to clash over whether to cut emissions by at least 55% by 2030, up from a current goal of 40%. A decision next week could push carbon prices beyond the record high of 31 euros a ton set in April 2006. “The belief in the market is that the political ambition or regulatory ambition is going to be raised,” said Marcus Ferdinand, head of European carbon and power analytics at ICIS. “The market is really in high expectation mode for a combined effort to hammer out a 2030 agreement.” Breaking that record is imminent, especially as the supply of permits is set to be unusually low this winter after the European Commission decided to delay the start of 2021 auctions until at least late January, according to Tom Lord, head of trading and risk management at Redshaw Advisors Ltd. “We think it is coming,” he said. “With this auction shutdown we feel that we could quite easily get over 31 euros in the coming weeks with no auction supply.” Ferdinand, the ICIS analyst, said he expects prices to continue higher and end next year at 32.50 euros a ton then go to as much as 50 euros by 2023."
" 2020 is on track to be the second warmest year on record globally since temperature record-keeping began in 1850, says the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)’s State of the Global Climate 2020 report released on Wednesday. It is preceded by 2016 and followed by 2019. Despite a global halt in economic activities due to Covid-19 and the cooling effect of La Nina, the global mean temperature for January to October 2020 was around 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, dangerously close to breaching the 1.5-degree threshold above which scientists warn of catastrophic impacts of the climate crisis. The results of high global mean temperature have been evident across the world. These 10 months were dominated by extreme climate events, including excessive heat, wildfires and floods. For India, high temperatures have had a devastating impact on communities, the economy, and biodiversity. According to the Lancet Countdown On Health And Climate Change report, released on Thursday, the country recorded the highest loss in work hours (118.3 billion work hours) or productivity because of extreme heat in 2019 — the year saw a record number of above-baseline days of heat wave exposure affecting its elderly population. June’s super cyclone, Amphan, led to an economic loss amounting to about $14 billion, says the WMO report."
" The massive Greenland ice sheet could be facing a point of no return, beyond which it may no longer fully regrow, permanently changing sea levels around the world, warns a new study. Using computer simulations, the study, published in the journal The Cryosphere, analysed how climate change could lead to irreversible sea level rise as temperatures continue to rise and the Greenland ice sheet continues to decline. While there were scenarios in which the ice sheet melting could be reversed, the scientists, including those from the University of Reading in the UK, said these relied on actions to counteract global warming before it’s too late. According to the researchers, the ice sheet is seven times the area of the UK, and stores a large amount of the Earth’s frozen water. In the research, the scientists simulated the effects of Greenland ice sheet melting under a range of possible temperature rises, ranging from minimal warming to worst-case scenarios. At current rates of melting, they said the ice sheet contributes almost one millimetre to sea level per year, accounting for around a quarter of the total increase. The researchers said despite seasonal periods of growth, Greenland has lost 3.5 trillion tons of ice since 2003. Under all future climates like the present or warmer, they found that the ice-sheet declined in size and contributed to some degree of sea-level rise. Importantly, the scientists said there were scenarios in which the ice sheet melting could be reversed. But these depended on actions to reverse global warming before it’s too late, the scientists added. Under scenarios in which global warming goes beyond 2°C, there could be significant ice loss and several metres of global sea level rise to persist for tens of thousands of years, the scientists said, adding that a warmer climate would lead to greater sea-level rise. In such cases, even if temperatures later return to current levels, the study showed that the Greenland ice sheet will never fully regrow once it melts beyond a critical point. After this point, the scientists said sea levels would permanently remain two metres higher than current levels, regardless of other contributing factors. According to the researchers, this is because the ice sheet is so large that it has a substantial impact on its local climate, and as it declines, Greenland would experience warmer temperatures and less snowfall. Once the ice-sheet retreats from the Northern part of the island, the study cautioned that the area would remain ice-free."
" India recorded the highest loss in work hours or productivity because of extreme heat in 2019. Across the globe, a potential 302 billion work hours were lost in 2019, 103 billion hours more than the hours lost in 2000. Only 13 countries made up 80.7% of the global work hours lost in 2019, with India recording the greatest total loss and Cambodia the highest per-capita loss for any country. India lost 118.3 billion work hours and 111.2 work hours per person in 2019 alone, according to the Lancet Countdown report on health and climate change released on Thursday morning. By 2015, the estimated loss in earnings because of heat stress reached as high as 3.9–5.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) for lower-middle-income countries tracked by Lancet authors, including India, Indonesia and Cambodia. In 2019, India also saw a record number of above-baseline days of heatwave exposure affecting people aged above 65 years. During the past 20 years, there has been a 53.7% increase in heat-related deaths globally among people older than 65 years, reaching a total of 296,000 deaths in 2018. The highest number of deaths among the elderly in 2018 were reported in China (62,000) and India (31,000 deaths) followed by Germany, the US, Russia and Japan. “There is an increase in the intensity, duration, and extent of heatwaves over South Asia — particularly the India-Pakistan region,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, citing a study by the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, as predicting an increase in heatwaves by up to sixfold under a 2° Celsius warming scenario. “This means that the health impacts due to the rising heatwaves also would be large. While we have an excellent weather forecasting system, we also need to work on health forecasting systems,” Koll said. The report warned that the imprint of climate change on extreme weather events was now clear. Advancements in climate science allow for greater accuracy and certainty in attribution, it said, adding that studies from 2015 to 2020 have shown the imprint of climate change on 76 floods, droughts, storms, and temperature extremes. According to the report, drafted by 120 global health and climate change academics, 40 to 60 million people in India will be exposed to a sea level rise of 5 metres by the end of the century. Around 67% of global cities surveyed expected climate change to seriously compromise their public health assets and infrastructure. The report concluded that “the window of opportunity is narrow, and, if the response to Covid-19 is not fully and directly aligned with national climate change strategies, the world will be unable to meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement, damaging health and health systems today, and in the future.” The report underlined that Covid-19 and climate change were interlinked crises. “The pandemic has shown us that when health is threatened on a global scale, our economies and ways of life can come to a standstill,” Ian Hamilton, executive director of the Lancet Countdown, said in a statement."
" Climate change is increasingly damaging the UN’s most cherished heritage sites, a leading conservation agency warned Wednesday, reporting that Australia’s Great Barrier Reef and dozens of other natural wonders are facing severe threats. Climate change that has lead to shrinking glaciers, increasing fires, floods and droughts, and the bleaching of coral reefs are among the troubles facing 83 of the 252 World Heritage Sites listed by UNESCO, the UN’s cultural agency. Sixteen World Heritage sites have deteriorated since the last World Heritage Outlook was released three years ago, while only eight improved, said the International Union for Conservation of Nature, made up of governments and civil society groups and advises UNESCO on natural threats to those sites. “Natural World Heritage sites are amongst the world’s most precious places, and we owe it to future generations to protect them,” IUCN Director-General Bruno Oberle said. “Climate change is wreaking (havoc) on natural World Heritage, from shrinking glaciers to coral bleaching to increasingly frequent and severe fires and droughts.” The report says the Great Barrier Reef, where ocean warming, acidification and extreme weather have added to the coral decline and shrinking marine species populations, were one of four sites in Australia under “very high” threat. The islands of protected areas in the Gulf of California in Mexico have also entered the “critical” category in the listing. Spain’s Garajonay National Park, Olympic National Park in the United States, and Mexico’s Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve are among those under “very high” threat, the new report said. It said while 63% of the heritage sites are classified as “good” or “good with some concerns,” 30% are of “significant concern” and 7% are in “critical” shape. In a difference from the previous two IUCN reports, climate change has eclipsed “invasive alien species” — such as when foreign rodents, fish or plants are transplanted, accidentally or not, to new environments — as the most potent threat against such sites."
" Boris Johnson is mulling stricter UK greenhouse-gas cuts of as much as 69% by 2030, which would make it one of the most ambitious developed nations in the world when it comes to fighting climate change. A final decision hasn’t been taken, and targets in the range of 65% to 68% reductions from 1990 levels are also being considered, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the policy has yet to be finalized. A target of that magnitude would put the UK at the vanguard of global efforts to fight climate change, eclipsing the 55% reduction over the same period envisaged in the European Union’s Green Deal. It will also mark a key waypoint in the country’s plan to eliminate net emissions altogether by 2050 as part of efforts to contain global warming to at least 2 degrees Celsius. An announcement is planned before Dec 12, when Johnson is scheduled to co-host a United Nations event at which other countries may announce their more ambitious pledges on slashing carbon dioxide, the person said. “We’re looking at our nationally-determined contribution which will be extremely ambitious and will be published around the time of the climate summit on Dec 12 this year,” Johnson said in the House of Commons on Wednesday. Also Read | New Zealand declares climate emergency, promises carbon neutral government by 2025 In recent months, major emitters including China and Japan have followed the UK in setting long-term goals to zero out greenhouse gases. Those new targets will put the world on course to limit global warming to 2.1 degrees Celsius, according to Climate Action Tracker. But mid-term goals are also required under the terms of the Paris Agreement to ensure countries stay on track and to provide signals to businesses on where to invest. Environmental campaigners at Greenpeace have called for a target as tough as 75% by 2030 that includes international aviation and shipping and doesn’t rely on the use of carbon credits, where polluters offset their own emissions by funding clean-energy projects elsewhere. Adair Turner, chairman of the Energy Transitions Commission research group, said that in order to have “a really credible and strong commitment,” the UK’s new goal should be in the range of 65% to 70%. Alongside that figure the UK should also commit to almost fully decarbonize its electricity system by 2035. “We’ve actually got to get emissions down a lot in the 2020s themselves, because what matters is the stock in the atmosphere” of greenhouse gases, he said. Glasgow Calling As host of the next round of global climate change talks that take place in Glasgow next year, Johnson has been seeking to burnish his environmental credentials. Last month he unveiled a 10-point plan to boost green industries that included banning the sale of new diesel and petrol cars by 2030. The blueprint also included funding for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage technology and plans to expand offshore wind power. The new 2030 target will be based on advice from the independent Climate Change Committee which is slated to be published next week, tracking the UK’s progress to meeting its environmental long-term goals. Its most recent figures found the UK to be off track to meeting the net zero goal and is “unprepared for the worst impacts of climate change.” The new 2030 target would replace an existing UK goal to reduce emissions by 57% in the period between 2028 and 2032. That goal was set in 2016 but to deliver on a 2050 goal to cut emissions by just 80% by mid century. Since then, the UK became one of the world’s first countries to set a binding net zero goal for 2050, meaning it now needs a tougher mid-term goal.

Amber Rudd, a former secretary of state for energy and climate change in Johnson’s Conservative Party, said setting the new target was complicated by Brexit. That’s because the UK is due to leave the EU’s Emissions Trading System on Dec 31, through which big emitters like steel makers, pay for their pollution."
" This year is on track to be the second hottest on record, behind 2016, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Wednesday. Five data sets currently place 2020, a year characterised by heatwaves, droughts, wildfires and raging hurricanes, as the second warmest since records began in 1850. “2020 is very likely to be one of the three warmest years on record globally,” the Geneva-based UN agency said in its State of the Global Climate in 2020 report. Stoked by extreme heat, wildfires flared across Australia, Siberia and the United States this year, sending smoke plumes around the globe. Less visible was a surge in marine heat to record levels, with more than 80% of the global ocean experiencing a marine heatwave, the WMO said. Also Read | India forms high-level committee to implement Paris Agreement targets “2020 has, unfortunately, been yet another extraordinary year for our climate,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas, urging more efforts to curb the emissions that are fuelling climate change. Greenhouse gas concentrations climbed to a new record in 2019 and have risen so far this year despite an expected drop in emissions due to Covid-19 lockdowns, the WMO said last month. The latest WMO report said the global mean temperature was around 1.2 degrees above the 1850-1900 baseline between January and October this year, placing it second behind 2016 and marginally ahead of 2019. Hot years have typically been associated with El Niño, a natural event that releases heat from the Pacific Ocean. However, this year coincides with La Niña which has the opposite effect and cools temperatures. The WMO will confirm the data in March 2021. A climate pact agreed in Paris five years ago compels countries to make efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, above which scientists warn of catastrophic climate change."
" New Zealand promised its public sector would become carbon neutral by 2025 as it declared a climate emergency on Wednesday, a symbolic move that critics said needed to be backed with greater actions to reduce emissions. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the climate emergency declaration was based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s findings that to avoid more than 1.5 degree Celsius rise in global warming, emissions would need to fall by around 45% from 2010 levels by 2023 and reach zero by around 2050. “This declaration is an acknowledgement of the next generation. An acknowledgement of the burden that they will carry if we do not get this right and do not take action now,” Ardern told lawmakers in parliament. After an hour-long debate, a majority of parliamentarians voted in favour of the declaration. The main opposition National Party voted against it saying it was nothing but “virtue signalling”. New Zealand joins 32 other countries including Japan, Canada, France and Britain that have declared a climate emergency. Ardern, who returned to power in October delivering the biggest election victory for her centre-left Labour Party in half a century, has called climate change the “nuclear free moment of our generation”.

Nearly half of New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, mainly methane. The government on Wednesday promised the public sector will achieve carbon neutrality by 2025. Government agencies would have to measure and report emissions and offset any they can’t cut by 2025. The programme will be backed by a NZ$200 million ($141 million) fund to finance replacing coal boilers and help purchase electric or hybrid vehicles, it said. Greenpeace welcomed the declaration, but challenged the government to follow through with policy and action."
" Joe Biden has expressed a clear sense of urgency in advancing climate goals as the US President-elect discussed his decision to rejoin the historic Paris Agreement on his first day in office during a meeting on climate policy. In the virtual meeting with national security and climate policy staff on Monday, Biden reiterated his intention to ensure climate change is a core national security priority, according to a readout issued by the Office of the President-elect. He expressed a clear sense of urgency in advancing his climate goals, it said. Biden was joined by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris during the meeting to discuss ways to meet the president-elect’s wide-ranging and ambitious international climate commitments. The discussions included his decision to rejoin the Paris Agreement on his first day in office, the readout stated. On November 4, the Trump administration formally withdrew from the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change, a decision originally announced three years ago. Also Read: Rahm Emanuel could be Biden’s pick for transportation secretary The Paris accord committed the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures below 2C above pre-industrial levels and attempting to limit them even more, to a 1.5C rise. Biden has pledged that his administration would rejoin the historic Paris Agreement on climate change. Climate change is among the top four priorities of Biden. “President-elect Biden is leading the world to address the climate emergency and leading through the power of example,” said a policy paper issued by his transition. “Biden knows how to stand with America’s allies, stand up to adversaries, and level with any world leader about what must be done. He will not only recommit the United States to the Paris Agreement on climate change -- he will go much further than that. He is working to lead an effort to get every major country to ramp up the ambition of their domestic climate targets,” it said. The US is the second leading producer of all carbon dioxide emissions globally, behind China. US President Donald Trump’s decision to quit the Paris accord has led to condemnation from environmentalists and expressions of regret from world leaders. According to the policy paper, Biden will ensure that — coming out of this profound public health and economic crisis, and facing the persistent climate crisis — the US is never caught flat-footed again. “He is working to launch a national effort aimed at creating the jobs we need to build modern, sustainable infrastructure now and deliver an equitable clean energy future,” it said. Last month, Biden named former secretary of state John Kerry as climate envoy for national security. Kerry, 76, was one of the leading architects of the Paris climate agreement. Introducing Kerry to the nation for this position, Biden had said that for the first time ever, the US will have a full-time climate leader who will participate in ministerial-level meetings."
" US President-elect Joe Biden and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres have discussed the need for a “strengthened partnership” between Washington and the world organisation to address many urgent global issues, including the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change and upholding peace and security. Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19 Biden spoke with Guterres over the phone on Monday and according to a readout of the call, the president-elect thanked Guterres for his congratulations on winning the US presidential election. “They discussed the need for a strengthened partnership between the United States and the United Nations on urgent global issues, including combatting Covid-19 and building resilience to future public health challenges, confronting the threat of climate change, addressing humanitarian need, advancing sustainable development, upholding peace and security and resolving conflicts; and promoting democracy and human rights,” the readout issued by the Biden-Harris Transition team said. Biden also noted his deep concern for escalating violence in Ethiopia and the risk it poses to civilians. According to the readout of the phone call issued by the Secretary General’s spokesman, Guterres was “pleased” to speak with Biden “to extend his personal congratulations to the President-elect.” The Secretary-General underscored the “essential role” played by the “enduring close co-operation” between the United States and the United Nations. Guterres “looks forward to working with the President-elect and his team to building on our partnership to address the many urgent issues facing the world today, including the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, upholding peace and security, promoting human rights, and addressing humanitarian needs,” the readout from the UN said. President Donald Trump has been highly critical of the United Nations, withdrawing the US from key UN agencies and agreements and cutting funding to UN bodies. Also Read | Joe Biden gets access to President’s Daily Brief: Report Under the Trump Administration, Washington has formally notified the United Nations of its withdrawal from the World Health Organisation (WHO), pulled out from the Paris Climate Agreement, the United Nations Human Rights Council as well as United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), besides ending funding to the UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees. Biden has pledged that his administration would rejoin the historic Paris Agreement on climate change. On November 4, the US formally withdrew from the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change, a decision originally announced three years ago."
" Diets and workouts are passé. Well-being of the body, mind and soul is the mantra for holistic health today as people had to make do with home-cooked meals and zero access to gyms (unless they had one at home) during the lockdown! It’s this shift in the focus that’s making the country’s top nutritionists and fitness experts zoom in on the broader spectrum. While celebrity fitness expert Deanne Panday is all for “physical well-being”, nutritionist to the stars, Rujuta Diwekar, calls food a “blessing”. The two have translated their evolved approach into books that’ll change the way people perceive diets and exercise. Here’s a look... Balancing act “Joy and creativity are the aspects in life that need to be enhanced right now” –Deanne Panday    “Bring him in!” says celebrity fitness expert Deanne Panday and excuses herself as we start to chat about her new book, Balance. “That’s my dog Peach. He’s so naughty! I love animals and let him do whatever he wants,” she laughs.   This joyful approach also embodies her book, which covers 13 aspects of wellness to lead a happy and healthy life.  “People are obsessed with fitness and diet. But for me, wellness and the health of the body, mind and soul is a very broad spectrum and this book helps you understand that this [the pandemic] is not the time to diet or do harsh workouts. Many aspects of your life are to be given primary importance right now and what’s on your plate is only secondary because at this point people are going through financial issues, career setbacks, relationship issues etc. So, joy and creativity are the aspects in life that need to be enhanced right now. A lot of home cooking is happening too, which helps deal with these issues during tough times,” she says.  The book is peppered with personal anecdotes and Deanne talks about physical well-being. “I did workouts with toilet rolls (when there was a shortage in the US), used the steps, terrace and all kinds of outdoor workouts to explain to people that movement and motivation is important,” she explains.  Deanne’s first book, I’m Not Stressed, on how fitness, meditation, yoga and nutrition help deal with stress, became a national bestseller within a month and her second book was a fitness bible called Shut-up And Train! However, she wrote this third book after five years.  “I started to write last December. The concept of my book came from the thought that if I was ever to write my third book, I’d be sharing with people how I am as a personality − I’m positive in every aspect of my life, I’m the go-to person for my friends and family for any issues they might be facing, I don’t waste time and try to find solutions in a very calm way in all aspects, so I decided to write this book. When the time came to name it, Penguin suggested Balance because it was so perfect for the book – the concept, chapters, etc. Even the cover features me on a circular swing symbolising the circle of life programme I’ve written about in the book, so it all worked out beautifully,” says Deanne.  In fact, Deanne was supposed to go to the Maldives to shoot the book cover and three trips were cancelled because of the pandemic. “When I saw this photo in my old files it was so ironic – they wanted to name my book Balance, which is also the name of my company, and the circular swing I’m sitting on in the middle shows balance. What I’m trying to say is, when your life is in sync with the universe, everything works out beautifully,” says Deanne.  “What opened my eyes during the course of writing was a Harvard course on climate change and its impact on health, which I added on to my book. I’m sustainable, I don’t shop too much, I’m all for Indian and organic products,” she shares.    A plateful of wisdom “Food plays different roles at different points in our lives” –Rujuta Diwekar  Celebrity nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar has recently published her book, Eating in the Age of Dieting, which is essentially a collection of all her writings over the last 10 years.   “I wrote my first book, Don’t Lose Your Mind, Lose Your Weight in 2009 and since then I’ve been writing columns and been active on social media and so this book is pretty much a compilation of all my writings over the last decade,” says Rujuta.  She stresses the importance of looking at food from the point of view of culture, climate, crop cycle and cuisine, as only then do diverse societies of people prosper.   “That’s when we look after our own health, our own economy and we also keep global ecology in a good place because climate change is a real issue we are facing right now and individually what we eat is going to change that. For instance, if you are eating a homegrown banana, coconut or cashew, you’ll leave behind  a very different kind of a carbon footprint, being more aware how food plays a role in the health economy and ecological aspects of our life,” she elaborates.  The idea for this book germinated in Rujuta’s mind from the Facebook lives she did during the lockdown. “They were about what one could do while stuck at home with local, seasonal food and what one could do in terms of exercise. So, we did videos focused on PCOD, constipation, insomnia, etc.,” says Rujuta. The feedback she constantly got from viewers was that it would be nice if it was all in a book so they could have all information in one place.  It took her about three to four months to compile this book about uncomplicating the act of eating and driving home the point that food comes from farms and is cooked in our kitchens devoid of hashtags, trends and influencers because that’s an ever-chaging thing.   “Take haldi-doodh, for example. Right from the beginning, it helped people through coughs and flu and worked beautifully as night care. We shouldn’t wait for the West to send us approval or newer names for our own food like turmeric latte or golden milk to embrace it!” she asserts.  Every book by Rujuta is focused on one topic but in this book, she’s touched upon food as a blessing and source of good health in one part; how food is local, seasonal and traditional in the second part; food as medicine in the third part and finally, in a fourth section, how food is for everyone.  “Food is part of your daily life and enhances productivity. It plays different roles at different points in our lives like during pregnancy, menopause and old age,” she elaborates.  The one thing the lockdown has helped everyone understand is that good health is more important than any other thing in our life, says Rujuta. “The lockdown has got people to appreciate home-cooked food and the time one invests in cooking!” she says.

" Climate change poses a USD 200 billion risk to the Indian GDP by 2030, as the rise in temperatures reduces the number of hours of outdoor work, a report said on Wednesday. This will be because the number of daylight hours during which outdoor work is unsafe will increase approximately 15 per cent by 2030 as compared to the present levels, the report by McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) said. As of 2017, heat-exposed work contributes nearly half of the GDP, drives about 30 per cent of GDP growth, and employs about 75 per cent of the labour force or some 380 million people. “…lost labour hours due to increasing heat and humidity could put approximately 2.5–4.5 per cent of GDP at risk by 2030, equivalent to roughly USD 150–250 billion,” it estimated. Without targeted adaptation action, around 160-200 million people in India could annually bear a 5 per cent chance of being exposed to a lethal heat wave as early as 2030, it warned. As a mitigation strategy, India will have to shift working hours for outdoor workers, undertake heat management efforts in the cities, and also consider movement of labour and capital out of high-risk areas, it said. Adaptation will be “particularly challenging” for the urban poor, who will likely require public support, it said, estimating that capital costs of USD 110 billion will be required by 2030 to provide air-conditioning alone. Apart from the heat impact on the workforce, vagaries in the climate can up the likelihood of a massive ten per cent reduction in yields on crops like rice, corn, wheat and soy, it said. “Indian agriculture may be hit not only by lost hours from extreme heat and humidity but by potential yield declines as well,” it said. “We examined the probability of a yield decline or improvement of greater than 10 per cent for today, 2030, and 2050. We find that certain countries are more exposed than others because of their climatic conditions and composition of crops, with India being the most vulnerable,” it said. Climate risks will not necessarily reduce agricultural yields for some breadbaskets or crops, but they will likely increase production volatility and end up destabilizing farmers’ incomes, it said, adding that while oversupply can affect through lower prices, undersupply can lead to food shortages and price spikes. Its partner Suvojoy Sengupta said policies need to be designed to mitigate the impact of climate change and most of Indian response, barring a few exceptions, lacks the effort at present. Given the fact that India is building infrastructure projects like airports, roads and transmission lines, there is an “urgent need” to keep the likely impact of climate change in mind, he said. Sengupta said given the changes in rainfall, with some years experiencing higher rainfall, already existing hydel power stations have started checking if the dams can hold the additional water and what is the risk posed to the structures because of the higher volume of water they may need to be holding. There is also a need to accelerate the de-commissioning of coal-based power generation plants to reduce the carbon emissions, he said, pointing out to studies which say the cost of de-commissioning can be between USD 110-220 billion over the next decade.

" Human emissions of the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change will fall between 4.2% and 7.5% this year due to the global industrial slowdown caused by coronavirus lockdowns. But carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere will continue to go up, albeit at a slightly reduced pace, according to preliminary data by the World Meteorological Organization released on Monday. The short-term impact of the Covid-19 pandemic can’t be distinguished from natural variability, the United Nations agency said. “The lockdown-related fall in emissions is just a tiny blip on the long-term graph,” WMO secretary general Petteri Taalas said in a statement. “We need a sustained flattening of the curve.” Carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for centuries, and in the ocean for even longer. That means concentrations of the warming gas will continue to rise for years, even if human emissions fall or are brought to a halt. In 2019, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere breached a new threshold of 410 parts per million, from 400 parts per million in 2015, according to the WMO’s Greenhouse Gas Bulletin released on Monday. “Such a rate of increase has never been seen in the history of our records,” Taalas said. “The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO₂ was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3°C warmer and sea level was 10-20 meters higher than now —but there weren’t 7.7 billion inhabitants.” Concentrations of CO₂ in the atmosphere were 48% higher in 2019 than 1750, according to the report. The increase observed from 2018 to 2019 was larger than that observed during the previous one-year period, and larger than the average over the last decade. Methane presence in the atmosphere were up by 160% from pre-industrial times, while nitrous oxide was up 23%."
" Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the main driver of climate change, hit record highs last year and have continued climbing this year, despite measures to halt the pandemic, the UN said Monday. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said that while lockdowns and other measures had cut emissions, this had not curbed record concentrations of the greenhouse gases that are trapping heat in the atmosphere, raising temperatures, causing sea levels to rise and driving more extreme weather."
" Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the G20 Summit on Sunday asserted that for an inclusive, resilient and sustainable recovery in a post-Covid world, effective global governance is required and reformed multilateralism is the need of the hour. At a G20 session, he also underscored the importance of the ‘2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals’ aimed at “leaving no one behind”. The prime minister said that India is following the same principle in the ‘Reform-Perform-Transform’ strategy to move forward and taking inclusive development efforts that are participative, according to a Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) statement. With the changing situation in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, Modi said, India has adopted a ‘Self Reliant India’ initiative. Following this vision, based on its competence and dependability, India will become an important and reliable pillar of the world economy and global supply chains, he said. The prime minister also underscored that for an inclusive, resilient and sustainable recovery in a post-Covid world, effective global governance is required and reformed multilateralism through improvement in character, governance and processes of multilateral institutions is the need of the hour. The agenda of the second day of the G20 summit focused on a session on building an inclusive, sustainable and resilient future. In a recorded message at a G-20 summit side event -- ‘Safeguarding the Planet: The Circular Carbon Economy Approach’, Modi said climate change must be fought not in silos but in an integrated, comprehensive and holistic way. He asserted that the entire world can progress faster if there is greater support of technology and finance to developing nations. Modi said India is not only meeting its Paris Agreement targets, but also exceeding them. “Inspired by our traditional ethos of living in harmony with the environment, and the commitment of my government, India has adopted low-carbon and climate-resilient development practices,” he said. The prime minister said for humanity to prosper, every single individual must prosper. “Rather than seeing labour as a factor of production alone, the focus must be on the human dignity of every worker,” Modi said. Such an approach would be the best guarantee for safeguarding the planet, he said. Modi said that in times of Covid-19 when everyone is focused on saving citizens and economies from the effects of the global pandemic, it is equally important to keep focus on fighting climate change. “Climate change must be fought not in silos but in an integrated, comprehensive and holistic way,” he said and highlighted that India is not only meeting its Paris Agreement targets, but also exceeding them. India is a signatory to the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Paris accord was adopted at the UN climate conference “COP 21” held in the French capital in 2015 with an aim to reduce hazardous greenhouse gas emissions. Underlining that India has taken concrete action in many areas, Modi said the country has made LED lights popular and noted that this saves 38 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emission per year. “Smoke free kitchens have been provided to over 80 million households through our Ujjwala Scheme. This is among the largest clean energy drives globally,” he said. “There are efforts to eliminate single-use plastics; our forest cover is expanding; the lion and tiger population is increasing; we aim to restore 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030; and we are encouraging a circular economy,” the prime minister said. India is making next-generation infrastructure such as metro networks, water-ways and more, Modi said, adding that in addition to convenience and efficiency, they will also contribute to a cleaner environment. “We will meet our goal of 175 gigawatts of renewable energy well before the target of 2022. Now, we are taking a big step ahead by seeking to achieve 450 gigawatts by 2030,” he said. Modi also pointed out that the International Solar Alliance (ISA) is among the fastest growing international organisations, with 88 signatories. With plans to mobilise billions of dollars, train thousands of stakeholders, and promote research and development in renewable energy, ISA will contribute to reducing carbon footprint, he said. Modi also cited the example of the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), saying 18 countries, including nine from among the G20 and four international organisations, have already joined the coalition. The CDRI has started work on increasing resilience of critical infrastructure, he noted, and asserted that infra damage during natural disasters is a subject that has not got the attention it deserves. The poorer nations are specially impacted by this and therefore, this coalition is important, Modi added. Noting that this is the best time for further increasing research and innovation in new and sustainable technologies, Modi said it should be done with a spirit of cooperation and collaboration. The prime minister thanked Saudi Arabia for hosting a successful Riyadh Summit and welcomed Italy as it takes over the G20 presidency in 2021, the MEA statement said. It was decided that the G20 presidency will be held by Indonesia in 2022, India in 2023 and Brazil in 2024, the MEA said."
" The world community can’t afford to shift its focus from the challenge of climate change even as it works to protect people and economies from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday. Addressing a virtual event on safeguarding the planet that was held on the margins of the G20 Summit, Modi called for collective efforts by countries to address the effects of climate change and to ensure that green technologies and finances reached developing countries. “Today, we are focused on saving our citizens and economies from the effects of the global pandemic. Equally important is to keep our focus on fighting climate change. Climate change must be fought not in silos but in an integrated, comprehensive and holistic way,” he said. Calling for enhanced research and innovation in new and sustainable technologies, he added: “We should do so with a spirit of cooperation and collaboration. The entire world can progress faster if there is greater support of technology and finance to the developing world.” In keeping with its traditional ethos of living in harmony with the environment, India has adopted low carbon and climate resilient development practices, he said. India is also exceeding targets set under the Paris Agreement and will reach its goal of generating 175 GW of renewable energy before the target date of 2022, he added. The popularisation of LED lights is helping cut 38 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year, while smoke-free kitchens have been provided to 80 million households. Efforts are also on to eliminate single-use plastics, and 26 million hectares of degraded land will be restored by 2030.

" Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday emphasised on keeping the focus on climate change, saying it is an issue which needs to be fought in an integrated manner. “It is equally important to keep our focus on fighting climate change. Climate change must be fought not in silos but in an integrated, comprehensive and holistic way,” he said while addressing the G20 Summit virtually. “We aim to restore 26 million hectares degraded land by the year 2030. We are encouraging a circular economy,” he added. Watch: PM Modi at G20 summit: ‘Important to keep focus on fighting climate change’   The prime minister said that every single human being must prosper if the humanity as a whole aims to prosper. “Inspired by our traditional ethos of living in harmony with the environment and commitment of my government, India has adopted low carbon and climate-resilient development practices. India is not only meeting our Paris Agreement targets but also exceeding them,” said PM Modi. Saudi Arabia, which assumed the G20 presidency this year, is the host of the virtual summit that is bringing together leaders from the world’s richest and most developed economies, such as the US, China, India, Turkey, France, the UK and Brazil, among others. Speaking at the summit on Saturday, PM Modi had called for a global index for the post-Covid-19 world based on four key elements - creation of a vast talent pool, ensuring reach of technology to all segments of society, transparency in systems of governance and dealing with Mother Earth in a spirit of Trusteeship. He had also termed the Covid-19 pandemic as an important turning point in the history of humanity and the biggest challenge the world is facing since World War II."
" G20 leaders will pledge to “spare no effort” in ensuring the equitable distribution of coronavirus vaccines worldwide and reaffirm support for debt-laden poor countries, according to a draft communique seen by AFP Sunday. The leaders also struck a unified tone on supporting “multilateral” trade as well as the global fight against climate change, but the closing document lacks firm details on many of the issues dominating the virtual summit hosted by Riyadh. The two-day gathering that began Saturday comes as international efforts intensify for a large-scale rollout of coronavirus vaccines after a breakthrough in trials, and as EU and other leaders call for G20 nations to plug a $4.5-billion funding shortfall. “We have mobilised resources to address the immediate financing needs in global health to support the research, development, manufacturing and distribution of safe and effective Covid-19 diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines,” the draft document said. “We will spare no effort to ensure their affordable and equitable access for all people, consistent with members’ commitments to incentivise innovation.” The communique offered no details on how the effort will be funded. There could be changes in the final version of the document, which will be released later Sunday by the Saudi hosts. In a comment echoed by other world leaders, French President Emmanuel Macron said Saturday the coronavirus crisis was “a test for the G20”, stressing there “will be no effective response to the pandemic unless it is a global response”. G20 nations have contributed more than $21 billion to combat the pandemic, which has infected 56 million people globally and left 1.3 million dead, and injected $11 trillion to “safeguard” the virus-battered world economy, summit organisers said. But the group’s leaders face mounting pressure to help stave off possible credit defaults across developing nations. G20 nations have extended a debt service suspension initiative (DSSI) for developing countries until June next year, but UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has pushed for a commitment to extend it until the end of 2021. The draft communique, however, did not offer a firm commitment. G20 finance ministers will examine the recommendation when the IMF and World Bank meet next spring “if the economic and financial situation requires” an extension by another six months, it said. - Closing ranks on climate - On trade, the club of the world’s richest nations also emphasised that supporting a multilateral system “is now as important as ever”. “We strive to realise the goal of a free, fair, inclusive, non-discriminatory, transparent, predictable, and stable trade and investment environment, and to keep our markets open,” the communique said. Ahead of the summit, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she hoped the US will adopt a more multilateralist stance under the incoming administration of Joe Biden. US President Donald Trump’s robust “America first” trade policy has rankled world leaders. Von der Leyen also added that she expected consensus and a “new momentum from the new US administration” on climate change, and a reversal of Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. Differences within the G20 group surfaced at last year’s summit in the Japanese city of Osaka as the United States demanded the insertion of a separate paragraph on issues such as environmental protection."
" An Indian-origin student is among a group from the University of Oxford Student Union that is leading a drive towards a meat-free campus as part of wider initiatives to cut the university’s greenhouse emissions. Vihan Jain from the university’s Worcester College joined two fellow students to draft a motion mandating the Student Union to lobby for a ban on beef and lamb in university catering services, which was recently passed with 31 votes to 9 and 13 abstentions. “As the UK’s premier university, the nation looks to Oxford for leadership, but Oxford has shown a lack of leadership in addressing climate change,” reads the motion. “The banning of beef and lamb at university-catered events and outlets is a feasible and effective strategy to help the university meet its revised 2030 goal,” it reads. The move means that the Student Union will now actively lobby the university and individual colleges to move towards meat reduction and eventual removal from campus. Responding to criticisms that the beef and lamb ban could affect the local economy, Jain told the ‘The Oxford Student’ publication that “alternative food offerings can be sourced from local enterprises and can therefore contribute to the local economy, but ‘eat local’ can be a deceptive piece of advice”. According to an Oxford-led study published in the journal ‘Science’ this week, what we eat, how much we eat, how much is wasted, and how food is produced need to change drastically by 2050, if we want to limit the increase in global temperatures to 1.5°C or 2°C above pre-industrial levels. “The good news is, there are many achievable ways rapidly to reduce food emissions if they are acted on quickly. These include both raising crop yields and reducing food loss and waste, but the most important is for individuals to shift towards predominantly plant-based diets,” said Dr Michael Clark of the Oxford Martin School and Nuffield Department of Population Health, who is the lead author on the paper. Reducing the carbon emissions and biodiversity impact of the university’s food system is one of the nine priority areas of the University’s Environmental Sustainability Strategy. The Strategy has the ultimate goal of achieving net zero carbon by 2035 and addressing the global challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss. “The university is currently consulting on a draft sustainability strategy which will be approved next year and includes proposals to reduce the carbon and ecological impact of the food it supplies. These policies will be further developed in the light of the consultation response,” a spokesperson for Oxford University said."

" The world should react with the same urgency to climate change as to the coronavirus crisis, the Red Cross said Tuesday, warning that global warming poses a greater threat than Covid-19. Even as the pandemic rages, climate change is not taking a break from wreaking havoc, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies (IFRC) said in a new report. In the report, on global catastrophes since the 1960s, the Geneva-based organisation pointed out that the world had been hit by more than 100 disasters -- many of them climate related -- since the World Health Organization declared the pandemic in March. More than 50 million people had been affected, it said. “Of course, the Covid is there, it’s in front of us, it is affecting our families, our friends, our relatives,” IFRC Secretary-General Jagan Chapagain told a virtual press conference. “It’s a very, very serious crisis the world is facing currently,” he said of the pandemic, which has already claimed more than 1.3 million lives. But he warned that the IFRC expects “climate change will have a more significant medium and long term impact on the human life and on Earth.” And while it looked increasingly likely that one or several vaccines would soon become available against Covid-19, Chapagain stressed that “unfortunately there is no vaccine for climate change”. ‘No vaccine for climate change’ When it comes to global warming, he warned, “it will require a much more sustained action and investment to really protect the human life on this Earth.” The frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate-related events had already increased considerably in recent decades, said the IFRC. In 2019 alone, the world was hit by 308 natural disasters -- 77 percent of them climate or weather-related -- killing some 24,400 people. The number of climate and weather-related disasters has been steadily climbing since the 1960s, and has surged by nearly 35 percent since the 1990s, IFRC said.

Weather and climate-related disasters have killed more than 410,000 people over the past decade, most of them in poorer countries, with heatwaves and storms proving the most deadly, the report said. Faced with this threat, which “literally threatens our long-term survival”, IFRC called on the international community to act with the urgency required. Protect most vulnerable communities’ It estimated that around $50 billion would be needed annually over the next decade to help the 50 developing countries to adapt to the changing climate. IFRC stressed that that amount was “dwarfed by the global response to the economic impact of Covid-19,” which has already passed $10 trillion. It also lamented that much of the money invested so far in climate change prevention and mitigation was not going to the developing countries most at risk. “Our first responsibility is to protect communities that are most exposed and vulnerable to climate risks,” Chapagain said, warning though that “our research demonstrates that the world is collectively failing to do this.” “There is a clear disconnection between where the climate risk is greatest and where climate adaptation funding goes,” he said."
" Amazon founder Jeff Bezos announced on Monday in an Instagram post that he will give USD 791 million in grants as part of his Bezos Earth Fund to 16 organizations that are working to protect the environment, CNN reported. “I’ve spent the past several months learning from a group of incredibly smart people who’ve made it their life’s work to fight climate change and its impact on communities around the world,” Bezos wrote in an Instagram post. “...I’m inspired by what they’re doing, and excited to help them scale, we can all protect Earth’s future by taking bold action now,” he added. According to CNN, the full list of grantees is a mix of big-name NGOs, labs, reforestation, and climate justice groups including The Climate and Clean Energy Equity Fund, ClimateWorks Foundation, Dream Corps Green For All, Eden Reforestation Projects, Energy Foundation, Environmental Defense Fund, The Hive Fund for Climate and Gender Justice, Natural Resources Defense Council, The Nature Conservancy, NDN Collective, Rocky Mountain Institute, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, The Solutions Project, Union of Concerned Scientists, World Resources Institute and World Wildlife Fund."
" External Affairs Minister (EAM) Dr S Jaishankar on Monday stated that India’s immediate neighbourhood has “an egregious example of state-sponsored cross border terrorism”. While speaking at the third edition of the Deccan Dialogue, seemingly in an indication towards Pakistan, Jaishankar said: “As regards to terrorism, that era of ‘not my problem’ came to an end in 9/11, but it has still to provide an international collaborative effort. We have in our immediate neighborhood, a particularly egregious example of state-sponsored cross border terrorism.” The Minister said that the world was now becoming gradually aware of the global nature of international terrorism. “Our relentless efforts have kept it in the spotlight, bringing out related aspects, like terror finance, radicalisation and cyber recruitment. The goal remains to reach a comprehensive convention on this subject and we will not rest till that happens,” he said. During his keynote speech, Jaishankar also spoke about issues like climate change and pandemics. Deccan Dialogue is an initiative of the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India, hosted by the Indian School of Business, Hyderabad. It has grown as an annual flagship event, aimed at promoting multi-stakeholder conversations on India’s external engagement."
                  
" Boris Johnson was given a friendly warning over the risks of Brexit by Joe Biden during a 25-minute phone-call on Tuesday afternoon. But there was at least one bright spot in that first conversation with the incoming American president: a shared goal to tackle climate change. The British prime minister said that it was “extremely exciting” to discuss the global response to the environment. “As you know, the UK is leading the world in driving down emissions and tackling climate change,” he told Parliament the following day. As Britain tries to redefine its role on the global stage after leaving the European Union, Johnson has a lot riding on green policies. The United Nations COP26 global climate change summit in Glasgow a year from now is critical to the success of that broader mission, and to the longer-term reputation of the UK. The question is whether the new man in the White House is about to eclipse Johnson’s standing as a driver of action or enhance it if the two join forces.  The UK has a team of 120 climate and energy attachés, the world’s largest network of its kind, and since taking hold of COP26 presidency last year, ministers and senior officials have directly engaged with at least 100 governments to press for faster action. Also read: Boris Johnson urges Pakistan to assure fundamental rights of citizens This week, his government pledged to be at the vanguard of “green finance” and announced it will ban supermarkets from produce linked to illegal deforestation. Even diplomats from EU member states, many quick to criticize the UK as Brexit talks drag on, have praised British efforts to corral countries from Brazil to Australia to make more ambitious commitments. The election of Biden will see the issue shoot up Washington’s priorities after being effectively abandoned by Donald Trump. While that may help boost overall global efforts, some experts argue it could also ultimately expose the U.K.’s lack of clout when compared with the EU, China and the US “You are going to have a dialog going on between the EU and China and US, and things are moving,” said Rachel Kyte, a dean at Tufts University and a former renewable energy adviser to the UN secretary-general. “The UK is not in the middle of that anymore, so you have to exercise a presidency from outside of the circle rather than from right in the middle of it.” The post-Brexit mantra of “Global Britain” has been derided by opponents who say the UK’s influence will only diminish outside the EU. Johnson’s government also faces plenty of internal struggles after presiding over the worst death toll from the coronavirus in Europe. His inner circle was destabilized on Wednesday evening when a senior aide quit.  Yet on climate action some tangible UK successes abroad are apparent. In the past two weeks, Japan and South Korea have committed to zero out their greenhouse gases by 2050. Johnson, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and other ministers had been lobbying both governments in recent months and Raab traveled to the two countries to make the case. As an early adopter of a net-zero target on emissions by 2050, the UK is now well-placed to lean on other countries to follow suit. Biden, meanwhile, has promised to rejoin the landmark Paris climate agreement on his first day in office and to set the US’s own 2050 net-zero target. One key measure of success at COP26 will be getting countries that have dragged their feet to sign up to more progressive goals, said Alessandro Motta, an Italian diplomat helping to organize COP26. “It’s quite evidently a way to show that after Brexit the UK can still exert a leading role on the global stage,” said Motta. “The UK government has really put a lot of reserves on these diplomatic efforts.” According to a diplomat from a major European government, the UK is pushing the climate agenda through all multilateral channels at the UN, G7 and G20. The diplomat said Britain was aiming to get firm commitments from India, Indonesia, Australia, Canada, South Africa, Brazil and Saudi Arabia. The first real test of the UK’s influence will come on December 12, when Johnson will co-host a conference with the UN that asks other world leaders to set their net-zero goals. They will also have to set interim 2030 climate targets. With Trump on his way out, the US may now soon add its name to the list of countries making strong commitments. In the meantime, Johnson is redoubling efforts."
                  
" The Delhi government’s electric vehicle policy will help reduce carbon emissions by 4.8 million tonnes by 2024, Dialogue and Development Commission Vice Chairperson Jasmine Shah said on Wednesday. Shah said this while sharing the Delhi government’s vision for clean and green future of mobility at the prestigious UNFCC ‘Race to Zero Dialogue: Launching the global race to zero-emission mobility’ on Wednesday. The dialogue was organised by the climate group in collaboration with the UN High-Level Climate Champions and the UK COP26 Presidency. Addressing a global audience of climate activists and leaders from business and government, Shah said, “The motivation behind Delhi’s ambitious roadmap to transition of zero-emission vehicles is to address both climate change and the health emergency that arises from the high level of air pollution in Delhi.” Also Read: Delhi’s air improves slightly, recorded as ‘very poor’ after six consecutive days in ‘severe’ zone The Delhi government’s EV policy focuses on a very clear goal - 25% of all newly-registered vehicles should be EVs by 2024. As of now, the number is 0.2%, he said. “This clarity has enabled the government to focus on all steps that need to be taken to facilitate this transition. Delhi’s EV policy will contribute to 4.8 million tonnes of reduction in carbon emissions by 2024,” Shah said. Elaborating on the five key pillars of Delhi’s EV policy, he said, “First, we targeted fiscal incentives for specific vehicle segments that contribute maximum to vehicular pollution in Delhi’s and India’s context, which are two and three-wheelers.” Second, the government introduced non-financial incentives to help overcome barriers that might hamper EV adoption. For instance, the administration has allowed bike taxis to ply in Delhi only if they are EVs. “Third, we see it as the government’s duty to facilitate the setting up of charging infrastructure - in public as well as private complexes such malls, offices,” Shah said."
" Biden-Harris have won, and with them, the idea that the planet requires urgent protection from over-consumption, as do the poor. Although Biden is unlikely to cajole the Republican Senate to support his ideas, he can still enable global transformation. The US should at once re-join the Paris Agreement and the WHO. Doing this indicates US intent. Internally, Biden-Harris have committed to fighting extinction by protecting significant parts of America and restoring protection to critical habitat Trump cancelled. They’ve also promised clean electricity by 2035, and letting states like California pursue their ambitious environmental agenda, for example. Some of this will be hard without full Senate support, but Republicans under 40 are beginning to show concern about climate change, so perhaps there’s more support for these ideas than one believes. The US sets global trends. From worshipping super foods to stripping racism of all sense of shame, American values seep into other countries and cultures. All the more reason for Biden-Harris to push the envelope. We cannot afford to have an American President who asks citizens to go out and shop in the face of crisis. We need a President who asks citizens to share more than buy. We need an America where the mainstream acknowledges the environmental limits to consumption. Biden-Harris should address ecological collapse. The 46th President of the US can-and must-steer the world towards a place where reducing consumption, not increasing green consumption, is the way ahead. ‘Have Less’ should be the new American motto.

" Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama on Sunday congratulated Joe Biden on his election as the next president of the United States of America. “As you may be aware, I have long been an admirer of the US as the anchor of liberty, democracy, religious freedom and the rule of law. Humanity places great hope in the democratic vision and leadership of the US as leader of the free world,” the Dalai Lama wrote to Biden. Particularly in these challenging times, he said, I hope you will be able to contribute to shaping a more peaceful world in which people suffering poverty and injustice find relief. The need to address these issues, as well as climate change, is indeed pressing, the 85-year-old spiritual leader wrote adding: “May I also commend you for your choice of a woman, Kamala Harris, to be your vice-president.” The spiritual leader said after devolution of his political authority over matters relating to the cause of Tibet to the elected Tibetan leadership in exile, he has been committed to promoting human values, religious harmony and the principles of non-violence and compassion, which he believes are very much needed in today’s world. “I would like to thank you for your support for the Tibetan people, during your time in Congress and the previous administration, as well as for your statement in September this year,” he wrote. He said it has been the Tibetan people’s good fortune to have received the friendship and encouragement of the American people and their respective presidents in the endeavour to protect and preserve ancient Buddhist culture — a culture of peace, non-violence and compassion — that has great potential to benefit humanity as a whole. On their behalf, I take this opportunity to express my gratitude once again, he wrote, wishing Biden every success in meeting the challenges that lie ahead. Meanwhile, Sikyong (president of Central Tibetan Administration) Lobsang Sangay also congratulated resident-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on their victory in the 2020 US presidential election."
" Biden’s victory could end up reshaping the energy sector in years to come, although the president-elect may have limited room to maneuver given that control of the Senate remains unclear. The president-elect has pledged to spend trillions of dollars to speed up the transition from fossil fuels, slash emissions and curb climate change. Biden has also promised to ban new fracking on federal lands, which he may try to achieve via an executive order. Such a move would limit shale companies’ operations in several states, including New Mexico. Oil & gas Biden’s electoral win adds to the hurdles facing the oil and gas industry, already hammered by a crash in demand amid the pandemic. The Democrat is expected to block new drilling permits on federal lands, something he could do via an executive order. His move to clamp down on the industry’s emissions would reverse the Trump administration’s relaxation of environmental regulation, and likely increase the cost of producing, transporting and processing hydrocarbons. Biden’s target for a 100% clean electricity grid by 2035 could squeeze natural gas’s share of power generation, and his aim to boost electric vehicles sales would erode demand for gasoline and diesel. To be sure, Biden’s proposal to curb production on federal lands could have a positive effect on prices by trimming supply expansion. Stimulus spending to revive the economy could also boost demand for fossil fuels in the shorter term. LNG exports Biden’s climate plan doesn’t mention liquefied natural gas. Still, the construction of new pipelines and LNG terminals in the , which has emerged in the last few years as a major global exporter of LNG, could face higher scrutiny should Biden be able to form a Democratic majority at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees the construction of energy infrastructure. LNG exporters could eventually benefit in one way under a Biden administration: if his administration succeeds in its efforts to reduce emissions from America’s shale fields, that may attract climate-conscious buyers in Europe. Similarly, a thaw in -China relations could give exporters greater access to a major world market. Renewables Biden’s presidency could super-charge growth of clean electricity in America. During the campaign, he said he’s aiming to eliminate carbon emissions from the power sector by 2035. Investor interest in green stocks and technologies has surged recently. Among the things driving growth: mounting homeowner demand for rooftop solar and batteries amid blackouts from hurricanes and wildfire risk and a growing appetite for environmental, social and governance, or ESG, investments. Wind and solar power are already the cheapest electrical sources in many markets. Coal Biden’s victory is likely to accelerate the decline of coal. Demand has slumped as utilities continue to shift to cheaper and cleaner natural gas and renewables, and Biden’s call for a carbon-free electricity grid within 15 years will leave little room for the dirtiest fossil fuel. Trump vowed during the 2016 campaign to revive the industry, and once in office he rolled back numerous environmental regulations to aid miners. But his efforts did little to counter a decline that’s been driven by inexorable market forces. Coal will account for about 19% of electricity this year, down from more than half as recently as 2006. USMCA A Biden victory may put pressure on Mexico President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to damp down his nationalist energy agenda. Lopez Obrador has stoked tensions between the trade partners by halting foreign energy projects -- including suspending competitive oil and electricity auctions, calling on regulators to stop issuing new permits, and announcing that he may change the constitution to reverse the energy privatizations of his predecessor. Last month, a group of senators wrote to Trump, an ally of Lopez Obrador, saying that Mexico’s actions “undermine the spirit” of the USMCA trade agreement covering the , Mexico and Canada. Ethanol"
" Wealthy countries have ramped up financing to help developing countries cut carbon emissions and cope with the impact of climate change, although it is unclear if they will meet their goal of $100 billion this year. In its annual update on climate finance for developing countries, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said donor governments contributed $78.9 billion in 2018, the latest year for which data are available. This was an 11% increase from $71.2 billion in 2017. The funds include loans, grants and a small amount of equity, plus private investments which public bodies helped mobilise. Developed countries agreed at the United Nations in 2009 to together contribute $100 billion each year by 2020 in climate finance to poorer countries, many of whom are grappling with rising seas, storms and droughts made worse by climate change. The $100 billion goal remains within reach, the OECD said, even though mobilised private finance, which totalled $14.6 billion in 2018, hardly increased from 2017-2018. “That means they’d need more public finance to meet that target,” said Simon Buckle, head of the OECD’s climate change division. “That’s not impossible, based on this trend.” With the coronavirus pandemic upending investments this year, the OECD said data were not yet available on how the pandemic has affected climate finance. “Developed countries haven’t yet delivered on their promise, both in terms of quantity and quality,” said Mohamed Adow, director of Nairobi-based think-tank Power Shift Africa. Adow urged developed countries to increase support for “climate adaptation” - such as defences against wilder weather, or methods to adapt farming practices during droughts and floods. Only a fifth of global contributions went on adaptation last year, while most support focussed on cutting greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries."
" Underlining that climate change is an important issue that needs the attention of world leaders, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar on Thursday said all the countries need to work together to save the planet. “Climate change is a very important issue to be discussed world over and world action is needed on this. It is not like one country can make a difference. All countries will have to work in that direction,” Javadekar said in his keynote address while virtually chairing the ‘India CEO Forum On Climate Change’. Javadekar, who is the Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, said the United Nation’s ecosystem will definitely take note of India’s corporate world’s wonderful initiative to adhere to and even declare their own plans for carbon neutrality. “My suggestion to the corporate world is to propagate what you’re doing and report to us, so we can do the same... India is walking the talk. India is 2 degrees compliant in action and in contributions. Therefore, we are asking world leaders and other countries that they should also walk the talk and be compliant with the Paris Agreement,” Javadekar said. “We will have 175 gigawatts of renewable power by 2022. Now, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken it to a new height by setting a target of 450 GW by 2030. It’s a huge target and will account for a little over 40% of our installed energy capacity,” he added. The Union Minister said the country had in the Paris Agreement decided that it will restrict the temperature rise to 2 degree Celsius by 2100 and added that it had also declared that the country will reduce its emission intensity by 35%."
" Election day in the US is finally here. The contrast between the presidential candidates could not be greater and there is no issue that makes that clearer than climate change. Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden has called it an “existential threat” while President Donald Trump has insinuated it’s “a hoax” and is pulling the country out of the Paris climate accords. (America will officially exit the agreement tomorrow, whatever the outcome of the election.) Click here for complete coverage of US election 2020 Many in the environmental community frame the race as one of life or death. “The health of the economy and the fate of the planet absolutely hang in the balance,” said Bracken Hendricks, a former climate advisor to Washington Governor Jay Inslee who helped shape Biden’s pledge to move the country to 100% clean energy by 2035. One of the overarching differences lies in the future of energy. The Trump administration has made no secret of their enthusiasm for supporting fossil fuels. They have championed the dirtiest of all fuels, coal (albeit unsuccessfully), and they have used government dollars to aid the gas and oil industries whenever possible. Just two examples include cutting dirt-cheap leases for drilling on public lands during the pandemic and offering a stealth bailout to financially flailing firms. By contrast, in July, Biden announced a $2.2 trillion plan to decarbonize our grid by 2035 and our economy by 2050, which is deeply ambitious by any account. He’s united a wide swath of centrist Democrats, union bosses, environmental activists and clean energy barons. While Trump has been cutting scientists and scientific agencies across the government, the former Vice President wants to spend $400 billion on energy research and innovation. (And if you want a detailed roadmap to how that money should be spent, Varun Sivaram, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, has you covered on that.) Also Read | Donald Trump leads Joe Biden in internet search as US votes in presidential election If there is one thing environmental activists can be relaxed about, it is that people understand what hangs in the balance: Never before have voters so clearly indicated that they want candidates to act on climate change.  Edward Maibach, director of the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication, says voters get it and it is a winning issue. And climate change is an issue all over the country in different ways—not merely represented by the top contest."
" What happens on election day will to some degree determine how much more hot and nasty the world’s climate will likely get, experts say. The day after the presidential election, the United States formally leaves the 2015 Paris agreement to fight climate change. A year ago, President Donald Trump’s administration notified the United Nations that America is exiting the climate agreement. And because of technicalities in the international pact, Nov. 4 is the earliest a country can withdraw. The US, the world’s second biggest carbon polluter, will be the first country to quit the 189-nation agreement, which has countries make voluntary, ever-tighter goals to curb emissions of heat-trapping gases. The only mandatory parts of the agreement cover tracking and reporting of carbon pollution, say US officials who were part of the Paris negotiations. Former Vice President Joe Biden has pledged to put the country immediately back in the Paris agreement, which doesn’t require congressional approval. Experts say three months — from November to the January inauguration — with the US out of the climate pact will not change the world, but four years will. If America pulls back from Paris and stronger carbon cutting efforts, some nations are less likely to cut back too, so the withdrawal’s impact will be magnified, said scientists and climate negotiators. Because the world is so close to feared climate tipping points and on a trajectory to pass a temperature limit goal, climate scientists said the US pullout will have noticeable effects. “Losing most of the world’s coral reefs is something that would be hard to avoid if the US remains out of the Paris process,” said climate scientist Zeke Hausfather of the Breakthrough Institute in Oakland, California. “At the margins, we would see a world of more extreme heat waves.” If the US remains out of the climate pact, today’s children are “going to see big changes that you and I don’t see for ice, coral and weather disasters,” said Stanford University’s Rob Jackson. Because the two presidential candidates have starkly different positions on climate change policy, the election could have profound repercussions for the world’s approach to the problem, according to more than a dozen experts. “That election could be a make or break point for international climate policy,’’ said Niklas Hohne, a climate scientist at Wageningen University in Germany. In pulling out of the agreement, Trump has questioned climate science and has rolled back environmental initiatives that he called too restrictive in cutting future carbon pollution from power plants and cars. American carbon emissions dropped by less than one percent a year from 2016 to 2019, until plunging probably temporarily during the pandemic slowdown, according to the US Department of Energy. More than 60 countries cut emissions by higher percentages than the US in that time period, according to international data. “Other countries around the world are obsessed with the Paris Climate Accord, which shackles economies and has done nothing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in an email. “President Trump understands economic growth and environmental protection do not need to conflict.” “We’ve also done our fair share” to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday in the Maldives, a climate-vulnerable country. “We stand amongst industrialized nations as a beacon, and we did it not through state-driven, forced rulesets, but rather through creativity and innovation and good governance.” In the last debate and on his website, Biden pledged to set a goal of zero net carbon emissions from the US by 2050, meaning the country would not put more greenhouse gases into the air than it takes out through trees and other natural and technological sources. Dozens of nations, including top polluting China, have already made similar pledges. Eleven years ago, the world was on pace to add about another 5 degrees (2.8 degrees Celsius) of warming. But with emission cut pledges from Paris and afterward, the world is facing only about another 2.2 degrees (1.2 degrees Celsius) of warming if countries do what they promise, said Wageningen University’s Hohne. “If Biden wins, the whole world is going to start reorienting toward stepping up its action,” said climate scientist Jonathan Overpeck, dean of the University of Michigan’s environment program. If the US remains out of Paris, countries trying to cut emissions drastically at potentially high costs to local industry may put “border adjustment” fees on climate laggards like America to even the playing field, said Nigel Purvis, a climate negotiator in the Clinton and second Bush administrations. The European Union is already talking about such fees, Purvis said. Trevor Houser, a climate modeler for the independent Rhodium Group, and the computer simulation research group Climate Action Tracker ran calculations comparing a continuation of the Trump administration’s current emission trends to what would happen if Biden worked toward net zero emissions. Houser, who worked briefly in the Obama State Department, found that in the next 10 years a Trump scenario, which includes a moderate economic bounce-back from the pandemic, would emit 6 billion tons (5.4 billion metric tons) more greenhouse gases than the Biden scenario — an 11% difference. Climate Action Tracker calculated that from reduced US emissions alone in a Biden scenario, the world would be two-tenths of a degree (one-tenth of a degree Celsius) cooler. “Every tenth of a degree counts,” said Hohne, a Climate Action Tracker team member. “We are running into a catastrophe if we don’t do anything.” Other nations will do more to limit carbon pollution if the US is doing so and less if America isn’t, said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald. “In terms of leadership, it will make an immense difference,” she said. In Paris, the US was crucial in getting the agreement finished. The rest of the world ended up pledging to reduce roughly five tons of carbon pollution for every ton the US promised to cut, according to Houser and Breakthrough’s Hausfather. Nations also adopted a goal to limit future warming to just a few more tenths of a degree from now. A UN panel of scientists in 2018 said there was only a slim chance of reaching the goal, but said it would likely make a huge difference in helping avert more loss of corals, extreme weather and extinctions."
" As if the year were short on bad news, and needed more, a report by leading experts says the world could experience pandemics more frequently in future, that some of these will be deadlier than the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), and far too expensive to control unless there is a transformative change in the global approach to dealing with infectious diseases. The global report on biodiversity and pandemics was authored by 22 leading experts from around the world, and released on Thursday. It is the result of a workshop convened by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) focused on the links between the degradation of nature and increasing pandemic risks. And for those thinking SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19 is it, there are as many as 540,000 – 850,000 unknown viruses in nature that could infect people, warns the report. Interestingly, the report comes three days after the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported the outbreak of the Mayaro virus disease in French Guiana. With symptoms similar to dengue, this virus too is transmitted through mosquitoes. The majority (70%) of emerging diseases such as Ebola, Zika, Nipah encephalitis, and almost all known pandemics such as influenza, HIV/AIDS, Covid-19, are zoonotic diseases that are caused by microbes of animal origin. These microbes spill over due to contact among wildlife, livestock, and people, the IPBES report added. In the workshop, experts agreed that escaping the era of pandemics is possible, but that it requires a seismic shift in approach — from reaction to prevention. Also Read: First US Covid-19 vaccines could ship late Dec or early Jan, says Anthony Fauci “Covid-19 is at least the sixth global health pandemic since the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918, and although it has its origins in microbes carried by animals, like all pandemics its emergence has been entirely driven by human activities,” said the report. An estimated 1.7 million currently undiscovered viruses exist in mammals and birds, of which up to 850,000 could have the ability to infect people, the report said. “There is no great mystery about the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic – or of any modern pandemic”, said Dr Peter Daszak, president, EcoHealth Alliance and chair of the IPBES workshop, in a statement. “The same human activities that drive climate change and biodiversity loss also drive pandemic risk through their impacts on our environment. Changes in the way we use land; the expansion and intensification of agriculture; and unsustainable trade, production and consumption disrupt nature and increase contact between wildlife, livestock, pathogens and people. This is the path to pandemics.” Pandemic risk can be significantly lowered by reducing the human activities that drive the loss of biodiversity, by greater conservation of protected areas, and through measures that reduce unsustainable exploitation of high biodiversity regions. This will reduce wildlife-livestock-human contact and help prevent the spillover of new diseases, said the report. Also Read: Officials who embarrassed govt with RTI response on Aarogya Setu face action The report pointed out that it is costlier to control outbreaks once they emerge because of the costs of developing drugs, vaccines and implementing public health measures that could damage the world economy. It is much more cost-effective to prevent these outbreaks, it said. “It is a known thing that zoonotic viruses, in which viruses jump from animals to humans, are the next threat to humans because they will be new viruses that humans are not exposed to. Once these viruses adapt to human hosts they will start spreading. SARS-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19 disease is a classic example before us. You cannot predict which virus will be more invasive that spreads faster,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head, department of microbiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi."
" UP Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam (UPRVUNL) is constructing two large new power stations using Super Critical boiler technology. One is the Obra “C”, 2 x 660 MW project, and the other is the Jawaharpur, 2 x 660 MW project. The Jawaharpur project is owned by Jawaharpur Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited (JVUNL) which is a 100% subsidiary company of UPRVUNL. Both projects are designed and constructed by Korean company Doosan and both will use efficient “Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) Plants” as mandated by Ministry of Environment, Forest, And Climate Change (MoEFCC). As a result of using FGD plants, the flue gas in the chimneys will have a low temperature and it will be highly corrosive. In order to ensure that the chimneys would be durable and reliable, UPRVUNL had specified the use of high quality, well-proven chimney lining system from the United States, which has been used by power stations worldwide. For the case of Obra “C”, UPRVUNL’s technical specification was watertight and the contractor has now placed an order on the supplier of the American lining system. For the case of Jawaharpur, using some deficiencies in the specification text, the contractor is pushing for the use of a Chinese manufactured “copycat” system, which does not offer the required quality and performance track record. UPRVUNL’s desired US manufactured lining system has a proven service life of more than 30 years and it requires little or no maintenance. The supplier of this product offers his technology with a complete 10-year guarantee. The Chinese manufactured copycat system being pushed now for Jawaharpur will likely require frequent maintenance and repair and it will reduce the availability of the chimney by about 450 days over the 30-year life of the power station. However, considering the fact that his liability period for the Jawaharpur power station is only 18 months, this reduction in quality does not seem to be the contractor’s concern."
" If he wins next Tuesday’s U.S. presidential election, Joe Biden has pledged to give the country a leading role in global efforts to curb climate change. Experts are wondering how ambitious his plans would be on slashing emissions this decade. President Donald Trump, who has rejected mainstream science on climate change, does not have a plan to address global warming. The Republican president rejected the 2015 Paris Agreement early in his first term, and the United States is set to formally exit the deal to rein in global emissions on November 4, the day after the election. His Democratic challenger, former Vice President Biden, has pledged that if he wins and takes office in January he would immediately rejoin the international accord, and commit the country to reach net zero emissions by 2050. A push by Biden to re-assert U.S. leadership on the issue would likely also include a pledge to slash emissions by 2030. That is because under the Paris Agreement progress towards curbing climate change is measured by countries’ pledges to rein in emissons this decade. All countries have been asked to update those pledges, but so far, few have. “Credibility begins at home,” said John Podesta, a counselor on climate and energy to former President Barack Obama, who is now an informal adviser to Biden. Podesta’s think-tank, the Center for American Progress, has recommended to the Biden campaign that the United States commits to cut greenhouse gas emissions 43% by 2030, from 2005 levels. “I think the campaign will take a hard look at that,” he told Reuters. Researchers at The Rhodium Group agreed a 43% goal would put the country on track for net zero emissions by 2050 - a pathway which, if followed globally, would avoid the worst impacts of climate change. However, as the world’s biggest historical emitter of greenhouse gases and the biggest economy, “the U.S. should clearly do more than merely the global average,” said Joeri Rogelj, a climate scientist at Imperial College London. A fair U.S. contribution would require more than a 70% cut in emissions this decade, from 2005 levels, he said. The Biden campaign has not yet set an economy-wide emissions target for 2030, but his climate plan features a goal to eliminate carbon emissions from the power sector by 2035. With lethal heatwaves, wildfires and floods intensifying around the world, scientists say the world’s ability to avert catastrophic climate change could slip out of reach, if emissions do not drop sharply this decade. A Biden administration could get a boost from climate policies already in place in many states, cities and businesses. Together, these efforts could curb U.S. emissions 37% this decade, from 2005 levels, according to Bloomberg Philanthropies’ “America’s Pledge” initiative. “Maximising that potential will require strong, decisive action from federal leaders in the White House and in Congress,” said Antha Williams, head of Bloomberg Philanthropies climate programmes. But Biden’s ability to implement his $2 trillion plan to slash emissions would also depend on whether Democrats wrest control of the Senate from the Republicans next week. If they do not, he may need to take executive action."
                 
               
" An Indian organisation that leverages tourism and technology to help remote communities access solar energy has won a prestigious UN award for its efforts to combat climate change amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The Global Himalayan Expedition (GHE) is among the winners of the 2020 UN Global Climate Action Award. GHE is one of the world’s first organisations using tourism and technology to bring solar energy to remote communities. The recipients of the 2020 United Nations Global Climate Action Awards, announced Tuesday, bring focus to the best examples of what people across the globe are doing “to combat climate change in a year that has cast darkness upon so many.” According to a statement on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) website, GHE is the one of the world’s first outfit using tourism and technology to bring solar energy to remote communities as recognised by the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) and the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO). In the Hindu Kush Region, there are more than 16 million people without access to basic energy mainly due to their geographic remoteness. GHE conducts “Impact Expeditions” to remote Himalayan villages and uses a portion of the expedition fee to fund the capital cost of the hardware, transportation, installation and training of village-scale solar micro-grids. The micro-grid infrastructure set up by GHE is owned and operated by the community. To date, the GHE has solar electrified more than 131 villages in three regions of India, directly impacting the lives of more than 60,000 villagers. More than 1,300 travellers from 60 different countries have been a part of these expeditions. Enabling livelihood through homestay tourism has generated over USD 114,000 in income for the villages, which represents a 45 per cent increase in the annual household income, the statement said. UNFCCC said this year’s award-winning projects demonstrate leadership on climate change by nations, businesses, investors, cities, regions and civil societies as a whole. They range from the Caribbean’s only carbon-neutral hotel to the world’s first platform fully dedicated to green bonds to the first all-women solar team in Lebanon. Congratulating the winners of the 2020 UN Global Climate Action Awards, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the winners provide tangible proof that climate action is underway around the world. “It is exciting to see these climate solutions, which reinforce my call for decisive leadership on climate change by governments, businesses and cities, and for a green recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Let us keep pressing ahead to build a more sustainable and equitable future for all,” he said. UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said the last eight months have been a nightmare for many throughout the world. “Covid-19 has altered lives, economies and the nature of business on every continent -- from the largest cities to the smallest villages. It is the most urgent threat facing humanity today, but we cannot forget that climate change is the biggest threat facing humanity over the long term,” said Espinosa. Espinosa said the convergence of these two crisis has opened a window of opportunity to build forward, to build cities and communities that are safe, healthy, green and sustainable. “Nothing exemplifies this better than the efforts of our 2020 award-winning activities to address climate change.” The award announcement is part of the wider effort to mobilise action and ambition as national governments work toward implementing the Paris Climate Change Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. The UN Global Climate Action Awards are spearheaded by the Momentum for Change initiative at UN Climate Change. The projects are recognised as innovative solutions that not only address climate change but also help drive progress on many other sustainable development goals. The 2020 winning activities were selected by an international advisory panel as part of the UN Climate Change’s Momentum for Change initiative."
" Japan will achieve zero carbon emissions by 2050, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga declared Monday, outlining an ambitious agenda as the country struggles to balance economic and pandemic concerns. The policy speech at the outset of the parliamentary session was Suga’s first since he took office on September 16 after his boss Shinzo Abe resigned over health reasons. It reflects Suga’s pragmatic approach to getting things done, though it’s unclear he will have the political heft needed to overcome vested interests in weaning this resource-scarce nation from its reliance on imports of oil and gas. Suga just returned from a trip last week to Vietnam and Indonesia, where he pushed ahead with Abe’s efforts to build closer ties and promote a regional vision for countering growing Chinese influence. Now out of Abe’s shadow, back home Suga has been pumping out consumer-friendly policies. He has earned a reputation as a cost cutter. He said he intends to make a sustainable economy a pillar of his growth strategy and “put maximum effort into achieving a green society.” That includes achieving a carbon-free society by 2050. The European Union and Britain have already set similar targets for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, and China recently announced it would become carbon-free by 2060. Japan previously targeted a 80% reduction by 2050. Suga portrayed the need to shift away from fossil fuels to counter climate change as an opportunity rather than a burden. “Global warming measures are no longer obstacles for economic growth, but would lead to industrial and socio-economic reforms and a major growth,” he said. “We need to change our mindset.” Japan’s current energy plan, set in 2018, calls for 22-24% of its energy to come from renewables, 20-22% from nuclear power and 56% from fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas. Progress toward reducing reliance on fossil fuels has been hindered due to the prolonged closures of most of Japan’s nuclear plants after the meltdown of the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant due to the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in the northeastern Tohoku region. Energy experts are now discussing revisions to Japan’s basic energy plan for 2030 and 2050. The 2050 emissions-free target would require drastic changes and likely prompt calls for more nuclear plant restarts. About 40% of Japan’s carbon emissions come from power companies, and they must use more renewable sources of energy while stepping up development of technologies using hydrogen, ammonia and other carbon-free resources, experts say.

" In the third presidential debate that took place on Thursday, US President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden were at loggerheads once again on the issue of fracking. This is not the first time that fracking has been discussed in this election cycle. Here’s everything you need to know about the issue: What is fracking? Fracking is the technology that allows oil and gas to be extracted from shale rock using a specific technique called horizontal hydraulic fracturing in which drillers bore through thousands of feet of earth to reach the shale. Then the drill bits are turned horizontally deeper into the ground in search of oil and gas. After this, water is shot at the rock at a high speed and oil and gas molecules flow out of the cracks. How is fracking pertinent to US economy? Fracking has helped in the massive expansion of drilling and thereby in creating new jobs in the US economy. It has also helped the United States become the world’s largest oil and gas producer as well as an exporter. What is Biden’s and Trump’s stand on fracking? The debate on fracking is a decade long one as it is the central conversation point in the larger discourse around climate change. It is being discussed so much as it marks a policy difference between Biden and Trump. Biden has promised his ‘Build Back Better’ plan that focuses on renewable forms of energy and creating jobs through them and has called for a limited ban on fracking which means ending the use of federally controlled lands for fracking. On the other hand, President Trump rejects the concept of any ban and has held the idea that he is protecting the oil and coal jobs through his stand. Also Read: Trump deploys 2016 playbook, Biden expands 2020 battle ground Why is fracking a voting issue in these elections? The issue is a way for Trump to capture working-class voters, who tend to vote for the Democratic Party. Through this, Trump is also aiming to show voters that his focus is entirely on the economy and jobs. Moreover, four swing states—Pennsylvania, Ohio, Colorado and New Mexico—are largely affected by the issue of fracking and Trump is trying to capture the votes here. Pennsylvania has 20 electoral votes; Ohio has 18; Colorado has nine and New Mexico has five electoral votes."
" Slamming President Donald Trump for his comment on India’s air pollution, former vice president and Democratic Party’s presidential nominee Joe Biden on Saturday said he and his running mate Kamala Harris deeply value America’s partnership with India. “President Trump called India ‘filthy’. It’s not how you talk about friends and it’s not how you solve global challenges like climate change,” Biden said in a tweet, two days after Trump during a presidential debate accused China, India and Russia of not taking care of their “filthy” air. “Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia. Look at India. The air is filthy,” Trump had said during the final presidential debate with Biden in Nashville, Tennessee on Thursday. “Kamala Harris and I deeply value our partnership and will put respect back at the centre of our foreign policy,” Biden said in a tweet Saturday as he retweeted his op-ed in the latest issue of ethnic India West weekly.

" Britain’s new polar ship, the Sir David Attenborough, will leave for sea trials on Wednesday to be put through its paces before making its maiden voyage to Antarctica late next year to boost research into climate change. The 200 million pound, state-of-the-art, polar research vessel gained notoriety in 2016 when “Boaty McBoatface” topped a public poll for the name of the new ship. But the government decided instead to name it after the veteran BBC naturalist David Attenborough, and the RRS (Royal Research Ship) Sir David Attenborough is now ready to leave its wet dock in Birkenhead in northwest England. It will spend two weeks at sea off the coast of North Wales for technical trials before the shipyard formally hands it over. The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) will operate the ship, carrying out ice trials in the Arctic in early 2021 before it journeys to the Antarctic next November, where the BAS say it will transform UK research in polar regions. “This magnificent ship will take UK scientists deep into the heart of the ice-covered polar seas,” BAS director Jane Francis said in a statement on Wednesday."
" US President Donald Trump on Thursday described the air in India and China as “filthy” as he denounced Democratic rival Joe Biden’s plans to tackle climate change. At their second and final presidential debate, Trump renewed his criticism that action on climate change was unfair to the US. “Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia, look at India — it’s filthy. The air is filthy,” he said at the Nashville debate. Biden said that climate change is “an existential threat to humanity. We have a moral obligation to deal with it.” Also watch | ‘It’s not how you talk about friends’: Biden On Trump’s ‘filthy India’ remark  “We’re going to pass the point of no return within the next eight to 10 years,” he said.

" Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is set to bind Japan to a target for carbon neutrality by 2050, a shift in stance that will bring the country in line with the European Union and more than 60 other nations in efforts to combat climate change. The new target will be announced by Suga when he makes his first address to parliament on Monday, after taking office last month, the Nikkei reported earlier this week. Japan previously said it would aim to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050 and achieve net-zero emissions sometime in the latter half of the century. The move, if confirmed, would make the world’s third-largest economy the second Asian country after South Korea to aim for the 2050 target that is considered the minimum needed to keep global average temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 Celsius.            "
" President Donald Trump on Thursday used the word “filthy” to describe the quality of air in India - language that he has never used for a country that he has counted among America’s friends. “Look at India, it’s filthy,” Trump said during a heated exchange with his Democratic rival Joe Biden on the topic of climate crisis and his decision to pull the US out of the Paris Accord, during the second and final presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee. “Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia, look at - India, it’s so filthy, the air is filthy,” the American president said, arguing his position on climate crisis. “The Paris accord I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars, and we were treated very unfairly when they put us in there - they did us a great disservice, they were going to take away our business.” The American president has made a similar argument in the past - saying India and China got a sweeter deal under the Paris Accord - but he has not used this kind of language before for India."
" Climate change and human activity are harming Antarctica and threatening wildlife from humpback whales to microscopic algae, more than 280 scientists and conservation experts say in urging protections for the icy region. The coalition - all women - called for creating a new marine protection area around Antarctica, as governments on Monday began a two-week meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. Two Antarctica areas are already protected: The South Orkney Islands and the Ross Sea. The new protection area, proposed in 2018 by commission members Chile and Argentina, would cover the western Antarctic Peninsula, the northernmost part of the southernmost continent. The peninsula’s complex ecosystem includes penguins, seals and tiny crustaceans called krill, which are the main staple for hundreds of marine animals, including fish, birds and baleen whales. Unlike with the rest of Antarctica, one-third of which remains unvisited, there are no large areas of the peninsula untouched by humans. Fishing, tourism, climate change and research infrastructure all present challenges to the wildlife, the scientists say in a commentary published in this week’s journal Nature. The peninsula is also one of the fastest-warming places on Earth, registering a record high temperature of 20.75 degrees Celsius (69.35 degrees Fahrenheit) on Feb. 9. As the region warms, sea ice is shrinking back, leaving krill larvae unsheltered. This could have an impact that cascades through Antarctica’s food chain, the scientists say. Protecting the peninsula “would show the international community that collective action to tackle a global problem is possible,” Spanish science policy advisor Marga Gual Soler told Reuters. She called the frozen continent “a beacon for science collaboration and international diplomacy for over 60 years.” The 289 scientists who signed the commentary are part of the Homeward Bound program, which organizes expeditions for women to Antarctica. For decades, women scientists were prevented from travelling to the continent’s bases due to a lack of facilities for women, said Anne Christianson, an environmental scientist at the University of Minnesota. “Having more than 200 women join forces and say, ‘This is our legacy, we deserve a say in how this area is protected,’ is very powerful,” Christianson said. The commission, which includes the European Union, Russia and the United States, has also been asked to consider marine protection areas off East Antarctica and in the Weddell Sea.

" In a year when Covid-19 has dominated the International Monetary Fund’s agenda, the organization’s quiet rethinking of climate change in its latest World Economic Outlook report didn’t make much of a splash outside the Twitter feeds of development economics wonks. While the rest of the climate and energy world was poring over a different WEO — the International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook — the IMF’s comprehensive assessment of what the energy transition will mean for economies was relatively overlooked. For decades, the need to cut emissions has been dogged by questions that essentially boil down to: how much will it cost, and is it worth it? Unlike the IEA’s analysis, which excludes the impacts of climate change altogether, the IMF’s role requires it to grapple with the implications for economies of acting versus not acting on global warming. The standard models addressing these tend to have limitations — many of them ably critiqued by my fellow Bloomberg Green contributor Gernot Wagner — but the underlying assumption is often that cutting emissions means sacrificing growth. In its new report, the IMF takes a different tack, arguing that there is no trade-off between the two. It also goes further than a lot of climate economists by factoring in the so-called “co-benefits” from cutting emissions — the often neglected side effects, such as fewer deaths from air pollution, and reduced traffic.The IMF’s climate chapter models a package of policy measures that it says would enable the world to get to net zero carbon emissions by mid-century. In addition to a carbon price starting at a modest $6 to $10 per ton, the package includes 80% subsidies for renewable energy production, a swathe of green public investments, compensation for households, and a supportive fiscal approach — that is, being prepared to load up on debt for the next decade. The IMF points out, reasonably enough, that we seem to be in a low-for-long interest rate environment. Cleverly, the IMF tests its measures against those reductive cost/benefit models — both the old school modelling by William Nordhaus, which is notorious for downplaying the damage caused by climate change, and the newer methodology developed by Marshall Burke, Solomon Hsiang and Edward Miguel in 2015 that found up to a quarter of global GDP could be affected by 2100 if emissions aren’t cut. The IMF still concludes that its proposed measures are net beneficial throughout the rest of the century. Even using the model where climate action is most harmful to growth — Nordhaus’ — the IMF’s projections show only a slight drag on GDP from 2037 to 2050, before the longer term benefits kick in. Even this, the IMF authors say, would be negated by benefits from lower air pollution and reduced traffic. The IMF’s WEO chapter builds on other evidence  published this year that green measures are good for economic growth, particularly when it comes to recoveries. It also adds to the growing understanding among policy makers that climate change is far more risky than most models would have us believe. The Network for Greening the Financial System — a coalition of dozens of central banks and financial supervisors — noted last year that higher cost estimates were more “robust”, and that most attempts to model the cost of climate change leave out effects such as catastrophic events and sea level rise. The IMF’s new approach might herald a tipping point not just in the institution’s thinking about climate change, but the mainstream views of economics and policy making. The fund’s Fall 2012 World Economic Outlook included the argument that austerity measures might counteract growth, marking the crumbling of a prevailing orthodoxy that had long been advanced by the IMF itself. Still, the IMF has to figure out how to implement its new thinking. A Dutch think tank, Recourse, last week published analysis suggesting that the IMF’s Article IV country reports don’t take climate change seriously enough. Its detailed review of the reports on Indonesia, India, South Africa, the Philippines and Mozambique found that climate change was only identified as a macroeconomic risk for the last two.  The IMF analysis, Recourse argued, seemed to downplay the risks of South Africa and Indonesia’s heavy reliance on export earnings from coal, and of Mozambique being on the cusp of becoming a big exporter of both coal and natural gas. The report cites numerous instances where seemingly neutral IMF recommendations in areas such as tax or infrastructure would effectively lock in more dependence on fossil fuels. High level models are well and good, but as the Recourse report demonstrates, the details of implementation are what matters. That probably isn’t lost on IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. “Macro decisions have micro consequences,” she told Bloomberg Economics’ Stephanie Flanders last month, in a wide-ranging interview that also highlighted a little-known fact about her background: her PhD was, it turns out, in environmental economics.

" Democrat vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris criticised Republican leaders on Friday for channelling their resources to nominating Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court instead of helping people in their states facing the coronavirus pandemic and not addressing the economic downturn in the country. “Americans are suffering from a deadly pandemic and a historic economic crisis. Instead of providing relief to families, Senate Republicans are trying to rush through a Supreme Court nominee in an illegitimate process. Don’t forget this,” Harris tweeted. Americans are suffering from a deadly pandemic and a historic economic crisis. Instead of providing relief to families, Senate Republicans are trying to rush through a Supreme Court nominee in an illegitimate process. Don’t forget this. The Senate Judiciary Committee is currently conducting the confirmation hearings of Barrett whose nomination will ensure conservative majority in the US Supreme Court for decades to come. Barrett is a Republican favourite and Donald Trump picking her could not have come at a more convenient time as the US president faces a re-election at a time when Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is leading in the national polls. The nomination of Barrett will also help around a dozen Republicans who face tough re-elections in their own states as she is known for her stance against abortion and Obamacare. Barrett also faced tough questions from Harris on October 14 when the Democratic vice-presidential nominee asked her if she believed that climate change was real, whether smoking caused cancer and if she thought coronavirus is infectious. Barrett answered yes to the questions regarding coronavirus disease and cancer. Kamala Harris, according to Associated Press, asked Barrett, “Do you believe that climate change is happening and that it’s threatening the air we breathe and the water we drink?” Barrett answered, “...very contentious matter of public debate. I will not express a view on a matter of public policy, especially when that is politically controversial.” Amy Coney Barrett will admit that COVID-19 is infectious. She’ll admit that smoking causes cancer. But whether climate change is real?

Apparently that’s up for debate."
" The westerlies play a bigger role than the Indian monsoon in controlling rain, snow and glacier health in the Western Himalayas, a new study has found. A team of scientists from the School of Environmental Sciences at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) have analysed lake sediments from Chandratal lake in Himachal Pradesh to understand what has been determining glacial retreat, or in some cases glacial advance, in the western Himalayas. The results, published in Nature journal last month, indicate that summer monsoon dominated precipitation 21% of the time, whereas the mid-latitude westerlies dominated precipitation 79% of the time and hence have been the main source of moisture during the last 1,100 years. Also Read: AQI enters red zone, all eyes on farm fires Glaciers are vulnerable to the impact of climate change, which can lead to several changes in water availability in the region. Understanding past moisture source for rain and snowfall over the Himalayan glaciers can also help understand how climate change will impact them in the future, authors of the study said. Normally, studies on a glacier’s life cycle are conducted based on ice cores. “Obtaining ice core from the region is difficult and where it has been obtained it hasn’t given much information. So we have retrieved sediments from Chandratal to understand what may have happened. We know now that the monsoon impact has weakened and it’s not bringing as much rain in the northwestern region as it used to be . Climate change has also impacted the westerlies or western disturbances with more cases of extremely heavy rain or snow being recorded. Such changes will impact moisture availability and hence could affect the glacier dynamics and its retreat ,” explained AL Ramanathan, professor, JNU. India Meteorological Department (IMD) defines western disturbances as a cyclonic circulation/trough in the mid and lower tropospheric levels or as a low-pressure area which occurs in middle latitude westerlies and originates over the Mediterranean Sea, Caspian Sea, Black Sea and moves eastwards across north India. Also Read: Climate change spurs doubling of disasters since 2000: UN A ministry of earth sciences (MoES) report released last year titled Assessment of Climate Change over the Indian Region suggested that there is a significant rising trend in western disturbances and rain extremes. But rain extremes don’t necessarily mean availability of more water or ice, Ramanathan said, as they are not evenly distributed. Ramanathan said the sediment core records from Chandratal are a very useful tool for archaeologists and paleoclimatologists who are studying the fall of the Harappan civilisation. Some scientists believe that the Harappan civilisation fell due to drying of rivers. “Reconstruction of the dynamics of moisture source changes during the Holocene is of great importance to get an insight into societal development (e.g Indus civilisation) and future climate changes,” he added."
" Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday said air pollution across northern India was rising because of stubble burning and accused the Central government of ‘completely failing’ to implement anti-pollution measures in all states concerned, despite getting ample time to do so. Sisodia also criticised the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (Epca), saying it could not get enough out of the neighbouring states to tackle air pollution, which peaks during winter and plunges Delhi into a public health emergency year after year. Both the ministry of environment, forest and climate change and the Epca denied Sisodia’s claims.   Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, Sisodia demanded immediate and concrete steps be taken to check pollution in north India. Sisodia’s comments came on a day when Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) settled at 300 on Tuesday, just a point short of slipping into the ‘very poor’ zone -- the worst this season so far. “Smoke from crop burning in the neighbouring states has started showing its effect this time also. The Delhi government has consistently been taking many concrete steps both this year and over the past few years to tackle pollution. But the Central government’s concern about pollution is witnessed only for these three months every year,” Sisodia said. He questioned the role of Epca and asked why it has been “unsuccessful” in controlling from other states. “Like those state governments, Epca also seems to failed in controlling pollution. The Central government will have to take the responsibility for preventing pollution throughout northern India. Due to inactivity of the Centre in cases of stubble pollution, smoke from Punjab or Haryana reach Delhi every year,” he said. Countering Sisodia’s allegations, an official spokesperson of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change said, “The central government believes in working to end pollution and has taken various anti-air pollution initiatives in the last six years. To control stubble burning, machines for stubble cutting worth Rs 1,400 crore have been provided to Punjab and Haryana farmers, which has resulted in a reduction of about 15% and 20% pollution from stubble burning in these states, respectively.” Bhure Lal, Epca chairperson, responded by saying that the monitoring body has been in touch with the state governments of Punjab and Haryana for nearly a month, ever since the first signs of farm fires were spotted through satellite imagery. “We have been in touch with the governments of Punjab and Haryana and have been taking regular updates of the work that they are doing to keep a check on the stubble burning instances,” Lal said."
" Climate change is largely to blame for a near doubling of natural disasters in the past 20 years, the United Nations said on Monday. The UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction said 7,348 major disaster events had occurred between 2000 and 2019, claiming 1.23 lives, affecting 4.2 billion people and costing the global economy some $2.97 trillion. The figure far outstrips the 4,212 major natural disasters recorded between 1980 and 1999, the UN office said in a new report entitled “The Human Cost of Disasters 2000-2019”. The sharp increase was largely attributable to a rise in climate-related disasters, including extreme weather events like floods, drought and storms, the report said. Extreme heat is proving especially deadly. “We are wilfully destructive,” UNDRR chief Mami Mizutori told reporters in a virtual briefing. “That is the only conclusion one can come to when reviewing disaster events over the last 20 years.” She accused governments of not doing enough to prevent climate hazards and called for better preparation for looming disasters. ‘Uphill battle’ “The odds are being stacked against us when we fail to act on science and early warnings to invest in prevention, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction,” she said. The report did not touch on biological hazards and disease-related disasters like the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed over one million people and infected over 37 million in the past nine months. But Mizutori suggested coronavirus was “the latest proof that political and business leaders are yet to tune in to the world around them”. Monday’s report showed 6,681 climate-linked events had been recorded since the turn of the century, up from 3,656 during the previous 20-year-period. While major floods had more than doubled to 3,254, there had been 2,034 major storms up from 1,457 in the prior period. Mizutori said public health authorities and rescue workers were “fighting an uphill battle against an ever-rising tide of extreme weather events”. While better preparedness and early warning systems had helped bring down the number of deaths in many natural disaster settings, she warned that “more people are being affected by the expanding climate emergency”. Deadliest disaster Monday’s report relied on statistics from the Emergency Events Database, which records all disasters that kill 10 or more people, affect 100 or more people or result in a state of emergency declaration. The data showed that Asia has suffered the highest number of disasters in the past 20 years with 3,068 such events, followed by the Americas with 1,756 and Africa with 1,192. In terms of affected countries, China topped the list with 577 events followed by the United States with 467. While a warming climate appeared to be driving the number and severity of such disasters, there had also been an increase in geophysical events like earthquakes and tsunamis that are not related to climate but are particularly deadly. The deadliest single disaster in the past 20 years was the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, with 226,400 deaths, followed by the Haiti earthquake in 2010, which claimed some 222,000 lives.

" The World Bank Group has continued to invest in fossil fuels despite pledging to fight climate change, according to German environmental lobby group Urgewald, which cited over $2 billion spent on projects in the past two years. The bank has spent more than $12 billion on such projects since the Paris Agreement to combat global warming was adopted in 2015, about the same amount it spent on fossil fuels from 2014 to 2018, a study by Urgewald showed. The data, which Urgewald updates annually, was compiled from World Bank data and by contacting projects, companies and governments that received the funds. Urgewald’s latest tally of World Bank spending on fossil fuels showed that the majority of the money invested over the last five years -- $10.5 billion -- was new direct project financing, including new loans, guarantees, and equity. The World Bank said in a statement that it stopped financing upstream investments in oil and gas in 2019, but continues to assist “resource-dependent developing countries” with “advice on energy solutions that are economically viable.” “Reliable energy services are key to preventing and fighting Covid-19,” it said. “We are working with governments, the private sector, and other partners to re-purpose and accelerate energy operations to provide clean, reliable and affordable energy to hospitals and other critical health facilities.” Financial institutions around the world are focusing on supporting renewable energy projects in order to cut carbon emissions and slow global warming. Researchers from the United Nations Environment Program have found that the world is currently on its way to exploiting 120% more fossil fuels by 2030 than is compatible with the Paris goal of keeping the average increase in global temperatures below 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Urgewald study was released ahead of the World Bank’s 2020 Annual Meetings beginning Monday. The bank has said that without urgent measures to mitigate the effects of global warming, climate change will drive more than 100 million people into poverty by 2030. But the institution is “a big part of the problem,” Urgewald said in a statement. “The new report with updated data show that the bank hasn’t reduced its support for fossil fuels,” said Heike Mainhardt, senior adviser for multilateral development banks at Urgewald. “They have promised to help countries to make the energy transition, but what they are really doing is helping the expansion of fossil fuels.” (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.)"
               
" Vice-presidential candidates for US Election 2020, Democratic Kamala Harris and Republican Mike Pence engaged in a war of words over the government’s handling of climate change and wildfires. Vice-presidential debate mediator Susan Page asked Pence whether he believed that man-made climate change has made wildfires and hurricanes worse, and in response, the Republican said that he was proud of the administration’s record on the environment and conservation. “The climate is changing. The issue is what’s the cause and what do we do about it?”, he said, adding that President Donald Trump has made a “commitment” to climate conservation. “The air is historically clean,” he added. Pence said that while Trump will put America first, Biden will go back to the Paris Climate Accord and hurt the US economy with his focus on clean energy. Click here for highlights of US vice-presidential debate 2020 Responding to Pence’s attack, Kamala Harris talked about how her home state California was burning, Gulf of Mexico was hit by raging hurricanes, and the midwest was flooded. “This administration took the word science off the website,” Harris said, adding that a pattern with this administration was seen wherein they don’t believe in science. Harris was referring to Trump’s controversial remark questioning the science of climate change. ‘It’ll start getting cooler. You just watch... I don’t think science knows, actually,” he said at a wildfire briefing in California."
" Hindustan Times is launching India’s biggest coding Olympiad, Hindustan Times Codeathon, on Thursday to offer students a platform to learn coding and boost algorithmic thinking, mathematical and computing skills, and analytical thinking to prepare them for careers of tomorrow in science and technology. HT Codeathon is open for students from grade 6 through grade 9 and offers a curriculum designed to make coding languages such as HTML, CSS & and Python appealing for school students. The top 100 performers will be chosen for the finale in December. “Careers of the future would necessarily involve an interconnected vision towards solving global and national issues, such as healthcare and climate change. An investment in science and technology is an investment in greater equality; scientific knowledge. Science education brings tools and techniques that empower individuals and can help to combat inequalities,” said Dr Archana Sharma, senior scientist at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research), Geneva, Switzerland, best known for discovering the Higgs Boson or the God Particle in July 2012. . Interest in science must start young. “I strongly feel that more and more children should be trained for the digital age as the future will be driven by machines. AI (artificial intelligence) will lead to a lot of job disruption. Some reports say that 75 million jobs would be wiped out in the future but at the same time, 13.3 million new jobs would be created. That means there will be a lot of disruption in the labour market and therefore our children need to be ready for human-machine collaborations that will become common in the future. If they can learn coding languages, then they can probably get to do the better jobs such as creating new software, new AI agents and programming robots.,” said Professor Mausam, head of the school of artificial intelligence at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi. “It is not just about learning coding or computer science, but there is a need for training students to think critically and independently,” said Professor Soumitra Banerjee, general secretary of Breakthrough Science Society, Kolkata, a not-for-profit organisation that promotes science. Teaching machines human language is an upcoming field of research,experts said. “This is a big area of research called natural language processing and spoken language understanding. Some early successes have happened like Google translations, but there are a lot of mistakes, which tells us it is not ready yet. If children are trained in the language of the machines and the machines learn human languages, it can lay the foundation for an interface in the future,” said Professor Mausam. “With coding skills, students will be able to analyse and creatively solve problems by picking up a suitable programming language, design patterns and empower process of logical expression to implement solutions. Learning these coding basics at the school level will help break down challenging concepts into engaging exercises for young children,” said Anuradha Sharma, principal, Ryan International School, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi. “HT Codeathon is a sure route for our students to learn to code. It is a most important aspect of being digitally fluent. There’s no denying that technology now dominates all aspects of life. Being computer-literate just won’t cut it anymore. And everyone from Bill Gates to Prime Minister Narendra Modi is encouraging young people to give it a go. There is currently a shortage of software developers worldwide so learning to code can be an easy route into an open field of work,” said Nita Arora, principal, Sri Venkateshwar International School, Dwarka, New Delhi. With over 22,000 registrations on the platform, the Codeathon will train
participants for a tech-enabled future. All participants will receive mentorship from technical experts, get a certificate and an opportunity to win laptops or smart watches at the event."
" Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday highlighted the major environmental successes achieved by the national capital. He was addressing the virtual ceremony of ‘Daring Cities-2020’, a global forum on climate change. Speaking of the odd-even plan, Kejriwal said that initially there was lack of political will as well as fear among citizens that they would face transportation issues due to the plan. He said, “Earlier there was fear among the people as well as politicians that this would lead to problems but gradually we started seeing benefits of this scheme.” He also said that the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has expanded its operations to ensure people across the city remain connected. “We have given a huge push to develop public transportation.DMRC’s network has observed an 80% increase in the last four years,” Kejriwal said. “Sharing this experience with you all to let you know that political will exists to implement such plans now,” he added. The chief minister also highlighted that when the measures were introduced there were huge fines levied on violators, but gradually fines have decreased. Speaking about the air pollution that Delhi faces during the winter season the chief minister attributed it to stubble burning along with other causes. He said that due to stubble burning the air quality index (AQI) drops below normal range. He highlighted that the city has taken various measures to lower the effects of the stubble burning by using methods suggested by Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)."
" Addressing an international summit on climate change, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal Wednesday expanded on his government’s recent electric vehicle (EV) policy, the new crop stubble decomposer and other measures taken to tackle air pollution in the national capital over the past few years. Addressing the ‘Daring Cities 2020’ virtual conference, Kejriwal also spoke about how his government had shut thermal power plants and introduced the odd-even road space rationing scheme in order to reduce pollution in Delhi during the winter months. The conference is being hosted in Germany and is a forum for global leaders to interact on how they are tackling climate change, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Kejriwal was invited to address the delegates, alongside urban leaders and decision-makers from Bogota (Colombia), Sao Paulo (Brazil), Los Angeles (USA), and Entebbe (Uganda), and also to discuss multilevel action needed to tackle climate emergency and ensure environment sustainability, the CM’s office said in a statement. “During the past five years in Delhi, we have taken several measures to tackle the twin problems of climate change and air pollution. This has resulted in a reduction in pollution by 25% , in terms of average PM 2.5 levels. Some of the main initiatives that we took were the introduction of the odd-even scheme, the closure of thermal power plants, the ban on the use of polluting fuels, and the launch of a mega green drive,” Kejriwal said. He further said, “Our aim is to make Delhi the EV capital of the world. The Delhi government has recently notified a very progressive EV policy that will enable large-scale transition to EV vehicles -- 25% of all new vehicles by 2024 will be EVs. With a mix of financial incentives, creation of citywide charging infrastructure, and extra fee/taxes on polluting vehicles, we are laying the ground for the wide adoption of EVs in Delhi. The policy has been widely appreciated and it is our dream to put Delhi among the top cities globally in terms of adoption of electric vehicles.”"
      
" Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will speak at the ‘Daring Cities 2020’ virtual conference on Wednesday. He will talk about steps taken in the national capital regarding environmental sustainability and climate change issues. “Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has been invited among five urban leaders around the world to speak at the prestigious Daring Cities 2020 conference - a global, action-oriented forum to recognise courageous urban leaders taking bold climate action across the world,” a statement issued by the Delhi government said. The CM will address climate emergency and air pollution crisis in Delhi, and talk about innovative solutions such as the ‘Pusa Decomposer’ and the first-of-its-kind Electric Vehicle (EV) policy undertaken to tackle the crisis. The UN Secretary General and Federal Environment Minister of Germany will also address the plenary session of the conference, it added. The conference is being hosted by ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability and Bonn city with the support of the German government. The conference is a forum for global leaders to interact on how they are tackling climate change, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Leaders from Bogota (Colombia), Sao Paolo (Brazil), Los Angles (USA) and Entebbe (Uganda) will also take part in the conference."
                       
     
" British broadcaster David Attenborough led a call from conservation groups on Wednesday for the world to invest $500 billion a year to halt the destruction of nature, warning that the future of the planet was in “grave jeopardy”. Attenborough, whose new film “A Life on Our Planet” documents the dangers posed by climate change and the extinction of species, issued the call as the United Nations convened a one-day summit aimed at galvanising action to protect wildlife. “Our natural world is under greater pressure now than at any time in human history, and the future of the entire planet – on which every single one of us depends – is in grave jeopardy,” Attenborough, 94, said in a statement. “We still have an opportunity to reverse catastrophic biodiversity loss, but time is running out.” Opening the summit in New York, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that a million species were at risk of extinction and that climate change and the loss of biodiversity were “destroying Earth’s web of life”. “We are part of that fragile web and we need it to be healthy so we and future generations may thrive,” Guterres said. The call to redirect financing away from fossil fuels and other polluting industries and into locally led conservation was launched by environmental group Fauna & Flora International and backed by more than 130 organisations. “U.N. member states must take the lead in getting ahead of this crisis and putting funding into the hands of those who are best placed to use it – local conservation organisations,” said Mark Rose, chief executive of Fauna & Flora International. The world spends an estimated $80-90 billion on conservation each year, but studies show that hundreds of billions of dollars may be needed to save ecosystems from collapse. Britain, Canada and others joined the European Union on Monday in pledging to protect 30% of their land and seas by 2030. U.N. officials hope to secure a global agreement on that target at a major round of negotiations on biodiversity due to take place in China in 2021.

" US President Donald Trump on Tuesday alleged India, Russia and China might not be reporting correct Covid-19 toll figures as he sought to defend his own handling of the public health crisis at his first debate with Democratic challenger Joe Biden. The president also brought up the three countries in an exchange with Biden over climate change, saying India, Russia and China “send up real dirt into the air”. Trump has frequently brought up Covid-19 testing in India to claim the United States was doing a far better job of it, and attributing more testing to the higher toll. And he had previously alleged China was concealing the true magnitude of its Covid-19 crisis. But this was probably the first time he had alleged under-reporting by India. “You don’t know how many died in China. You don’t know how many people died in Russia. You don’t know how many people died in India,” he said, adding, “They don’t exactly give a straight count, just so you understand.” Watch | US Presidential Debate 2020: Trump-Biden faceoff over Covid-19 turns nasty Of the more than 1 million killed worldwide by the pandemic, over 200,000 were in the United States, 97,497 in India, 20,456 in Russia and 4,739 in China, according to the Johns Hopkins University’s Covid-19 tracker. Questions have been raised before about China’s figures that seemed to be dramatically low for a country where the epidemic started last December. It has serious credibility issues in this regard also because it did not tell the world early enough that the virus can have human-to-humsn transmission and that it can be transmitted by asymptomatic people. Trump has attacked India and China before in the context of climate change. In fact, he pulled the United States out of the Paris Accord falsely claiming it gave India and China a sweeter deal. He has repeated that claim several times since, always without any proof or truth."
" Kamala Harris says her running mate, Joe Biden, will share his vision for tackling the coronavirus and rebuilding the nation’s economy during his presidential debate against President Donald Trump. The Democratic California senator said Tuesday during a digital fundraiser with artists that “Joe’s goal in the debate is to communicate directly with the American people.” Harris says the country is at a crossroads in more ways than one, from the pandemic and economic recession to a reckoning on racial injustice and climate change. She’s calling Republican efforts to fill a Supreme Court seat before the election a “crisis.” Harris says, “And in the midst of all this, a president whose instinct is to always stoke chaos, division, and mistrust.” Harris is set to debate Vice President Mike Pence next week. ___ HERE’S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT WHAT’S HAPPENING IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE: The first presidential debate between President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden begins at 9 p.m. Eastern time in Cleveland.

The Bidens’ returns show the couple paid almost $300,000 in federal taxes in 2019, including almost $288,000 in personal income tax. The Bidens reported taxable income of $944,737. The release on Tuesday comes just days after The New York Times reported that Trump paid $750 in federal income taxes in 2016, the year he was elected president, and again in 2017, his first year in office. The Times said Trump paid no federal income taxes for 10 of the 15 years before that. Biden and Trump are set to meet Tuesday night in Cleveland for their first presidential debate, and Trump’s taxes are sure to come up. Trump has called the reports “fake news” yet still refuses to release his returns himself. Biden already had released two decades’ worth of his tax returns, in addition to the federal financial disclosures required of him when he was a senator and vice president. Biden’s running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, and her husband, Doug Emhoff, also released their 2019 returns Tuesday. Harris and Emhoff reported paying $1.05 million in personal income taxes and $1.19 million in total federal taxes on $3.02 million in taxable income. ___ 2:10 p.m. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump emerged from the White House to a crowd of more than 100 cheering supporters as they departed for the first presidential debate in Cleveland. The crowd, which included staffers and interns, cheered as the Trumps left the White House. Both the president and first lady paused to recognize the show of support with a few claps of their own and several first pumps from Trump. Trump boarded Marine One without comment. At Joint Base Andrews, where Air Force One was set to take off, Trump gave a wave and thumbs before boarding. ___ 12:30 p.m. President Donald Trump spent Tuesday morning in informal preparations for the first debate with Joe Biden. A longer, more formal preparation session was set for the afternoon once he arrives in Cleveland. Trump’s prep team includes former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, campaign communications strategist Jason Miller, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Jared Kushner, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany and communications director Alyssa Farah. Some other advisers like Dan Scavino and Hope Hicks have also been involved."
" India on Monday underscored the need to ensure that the nations take their obligations seriously to combat the climate change with the urgency it deserves. India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti said India was doing its part to combat the climate change with determination and focus, and in the spirit of South-South cooperation. “We need to accost immediately the reality of climate change and ensure that in the spirit of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities, countries take their obligations seriously and meet their commitments and contributions to combat climate change with the urgency it deserves,” he said. “India is doing its part to combat climate change with determination and focus and in the spirit of South-South cooperation,” he said. Through a video message, Tirumurti addressed the “historic” handing over of Palau Global Village conference facilities inaugurated by President of Palau Thomas Remengesau. India partnered with Palau in establishing this facility. The renovated Palau Civic Hall and the Palau Community College will provide critical institutional support to the Ocean Conference 2020 slated to be held in Palau on December 7-8, 2020. Tirumurti said India was committed to tackle the impact of climate change and supports Palau’s efforts to achieve their goals through necessary developmental and technical assistance. “The oceans, which surround us have the ability to be a benefactor, as well as an existential threat. Pacific Island countries are among the most vulnerable countries in the world,” he said, adding that there is constant exposure to extreme weather conditions with tropical cyclone floods and draught. Tirumurti said the handing-over ceremony marked the successful completion and handover of the ocean village facilities in Palau. “The project sees the culmination of the untiring efforts and resolve of friends from Palau, who have overcome tremendous logistical odds posed by this global pandemic and developed these state-of-the-art facilities,” he said. The Indian envoy termed the cooperation as a testimony to India-Palau partnership, which has heralded a new chapter of development cooperation under the India UN Development Partnership fund. “India’s interactions with fellow developing countries are marked by a sense of kinship and solidarity,” he said. He noted that India’s relationship with Pacific Island nations has deepened with the evolution of New Delhi’s Act East Policy, resulting in the setting up of the action-oriented Forum for India-Pacific Island Cooperation (FIPIC). During the first and second editions of FIPIC, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had articulated India’s desire to be a close partner of the Pacific Island nations and its readiness to work closely to advance the development agenda. Modi met with the leaders of the Pacific Islands Developing States on the margins of the 74th UN General Assembly in New York last year. “These sustained high-level interactions between our leaderships have paved the way for India’s increasing engagement with our Pacific partners,” Tirumurti said, adding that India and Palau have shared values and close links. “It is our endeavour to ensure that development policies in this region are inclusive and sustainable and are effectively harnessed to reduce inequality and contribute to empowerment and improvement of the quality of people’s lives,” he said. A leading voice in South-South cooperation, India has played a pioneering role in establishing the International Solar Alliance and has already committed 1.7 billion dollars in lines of credit as a part of its developmental partnership with other countries to tackle climate change in a multi-dimensional manner. Tirumurti also cited India’s legendary philosopher and thinker Swami Vivekananda, who had said that, “Each nation must give in order to live. When you give life, you will have life. When you receive, you must pay for it by giving to all others.” Tirumurti also expressed gratitude to the team of the UN Office for South South Cooperation that has worked tirelessly to partner alongside India in making the vision of South-South Cooperation a success.

" British naturalist David Attenborough has said he spent much of lockdown relishing the joy of the natural world by listening to the birds in his garden. Attenborough, the world’s most influential wildlife broadcaster, has become increasingly outspoken in recent years about the risks posed by climate change. In an interview with the BBC, the 94-year-old praised China for moving in the right direction on climate though he chided the United States. “The present administration in America, from a conservationist’s point of view, is disastrous. But there we are: that’s who’s been elected and we have to go through it,” he said. Attenborough, who launched last week a film about lessons learned during his seven decades as a television naturalist, said that the novel coronavirus lockdown had been relatively painless for him. “Many people are having a much worse time than I am,” he said. “I am lucky. I have a garden, I have a house... my daughter and I are surviving very well.” “I’ve certainly spent more time in my garden listening to birds, than I have for a very long time. A lot of people have been surprised by that - a lot of people have suddenly realised what deep, profound joy can come from witnessing the rest of the world - the natural world.” Ahead of the release of his book and Netflix documentary - “A Life On Our Planet”, he called on people to not squander the natural world."
" Another round of wildfires is ripping through Northern California, forcing evacuations and casting thick smoke over the region as hot weather and high winds leave the state perilously dry. A blaze in the wine country north of San Francisco more than quadrupled in size overnight to 11,000 acres, tearing through a region devastated by fires just three years ago. The fire, along with a second one in Shasta County, came even after PG&E Corp. cut power to about 195,000 people in an attempt to keep its electric lines from sparking blazes. PG&E shares dropped the most in three months Monday, though the company said in an internal memo that there are no indications its equipment was involved in the fires. Across California, more than 36,000 square miles -- an area about the size of the entire state of Indiana -- is under threat from critical fire conditions, affecting about 5.8 million people, the U.S. Storm Prediction Center said. And blazes are spreading fast, fanned by dry winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour, with gusts as high as 60 mph. Governor Gavin Newsom urged people to heed evacuation orders and leave immediately when authorities sound the alarm. “So many of the people that have lost their lives were just cautious in terms of taking seriously those orders,” Newsom said in a media briefing. “We really, really cannot say it enough. Please heed local law enforcement. Please listen to them when they raise that alarm bell.” California has been battered for weeks by rounds of extreme weather that state officials say have been fueled by climate change. Last month, a record-breaking heat wave triggered the state’s first rotating power outages since the 2001 energy crisis -- and was followed just three weeks later by another one. More than 8,000 wildfires have burned a record 3.7 million acres this year, choking cities with smoke, killing at least 26 people and destroying more than 7,000 structures. On Monday, more than 18,000 firefighters were battling 27 major blazes across the state. Shares of PG&E -- which went bankrupt last year after its equipment ignited catastrophic fires -- fell 5.5% Monday. The company told its employees that it has no information indicating that its equipment was involved in the start of either the Glass Fire in Napa County or the Zogg Fire in Shasta County, according to the memo obtained by Bloomberg News. The causes of the blazes remain under investigation. The Napa County fire broke out early Sunday and was raging uncontrollably northeast of Santa Rosa, triggering thousands of evacuations. The area was devastated in 2017 by the Tubbs Fire, which was among the most destructive in California history. About 180 miles north, the Zogg Fire in Shasta County has already burned 7,000 acres, prompting more evacuations. Butte County, meanwhile, issued an immediate evacuation order for some communities on Sunday due to the ongoing North Complex Fire. Nearly half the state is under an air quality alert. Smoke from the new blazes is already reaching Bay Area cities that have been choked for weeks by bad air from blazes across the region. While winds are forecast to ebb in Northern California late Monday, potentially giving firefighters a break, the heat will continue. High temperatures in Sacramento are expected to hit 99 degrees Fahrenheit (37 Celsius) on Monday and rise to 101 degrees by Wednesday. Los Angeles may hit 101 on Wednesday. Newsom warned that strong offshore winds could develop overnight in Southern California and said state officials are dispatching firefighters there in case blazes break out. Utilities across the US West are increasingly cutting power ahead of wind storms to reduce the chances of their live wires igniting blazes. In Southern California, investigators are looking at a power line owned by Edison International’s Southern California Edison as part of their probe into a fire that’s burning in the mountains near Los Angeles. PG&E began shutting off power on Sunday to parts of 16 counties. The move affected about 65,000 homes and businesses, or about 195,000 people based on the size of the average California household. The company issued an “all clear” for crews to start inspecting lines on Monday, and said it expects to restore power to “the large majority” of customers by the end of the day. The outages were considerably smaller in scope than previous ones. Earlier this month, PG&E cut power to about 172,000 homes and businesses -- or about 516,000 people -- as high winds raked California. PG&E emerged from bankruptcy in July after settling wildfire claims for $25.5 billion."
" In a year of cataclysm, some world leaders at this week’s annual United Nations meeting are taking the long view, warning: If Covid-19 doesn’t kill us, climate change will. With Siberia seeing its warmest temperature on record this year and enormous chunks of ice caps in Greenland and Canada sliding into the sea, countries are acutely aware there’s no vaccine for global warming. “We are already seeing a version of environmental Armageddon,” Fiji’s Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said, citing wildfires in the western US and noting that the Greenland ice chunk was larger than a number of island nations. This was meant to be the year “we took back our planet,” he said. Instead, the coronavirus has diverted resources and attention from what could have been the marquee issue at this UN gathering. Meanwhile, the UN global climate summit has been postponed to late 2021. That hasn’t stopped countries, from slowly sinking island nations to parched African ones, from speaking out. “In another 75 years, many ... members may no longer hold seats at the United Nations if the world continues on its present course,” the Alliance of Small Island States and the Least Developed Countries Group said. The main goal of the 2015 Paris climate accord is to limit the rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, but scientists say the world is on track to soar past that. A new study found that if the world warms another 0.9 degrees Celsius (1.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the West Antarctic ice sheet will reach a point of irreversible melting. It has enough water to raise global sea levels by 5 meters (16 feet). The Pacific island nation of Palau hasn’t had a single Covid-19 infection, but President Tommy E. Remengesau Jr. warns it’s the rising seas that will bring the country down. “The momentary drop in (carbon) emissions this year cannot be allowed to generate any complacency about global progress,” he said, referring to the sparkling skies that followed lockdowns to slow the spread of the virus around the world. Pollution has crept back up as restrictions ease. World powers cannot shirk their financial commitments to fighting climate change during the pandemic, Remengesau said, even as economies are battered. But few pledges have emerged at the UN gathering, aside from China’s announcement that it aims to have carbon dioxide emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The pandemic has muted the UN meeting, with world leaders speaking not from the podium in New York but via video from home. That has sapped the urgency of diplomacy and left nations wondering just how many people are listening. Amid concerns that the world is distracted, it was perhaps no surprise that the student-led movement Fridays for Future returned to the streets this week for the first major demonstrations for climate action in months. Still, island nations have seized on the unusual circumstances to show off what’s at stake. The prime minister of Tuvalu, Kausea Natano, delivered his UN speech with a vista of turquoise waters and swaying fronds behind him that instantly fired the imaginations of house-bound viewers. But the prime minister quickly shattered any dreams. While Tuvalu is free of the coronavirus, the pandemic struck as the island nation was recovering from a pair of tropical cyclones — storms that scientists say are likely to become wetter as the planet warms. Tuvalu’s highest point is just a few meters (yards) above sea level. The pandemic’s effect on the movement of goods exposed food insecurity as local agriculture becomes more difficult with rising sea levels, Natano said. “While Covid-19 is our immediate crisis, climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and well-being of the Pacific and its peoples in the long run,” the prime minister said. From the Marshall Islands, also free of Covid-19, President David Kabua used the virus’s example to plead for more help now. “Change relies on protecting the most vulnerable, because those on the frontline – whether healthcare workers battling the pandemic or small island nations sounding the alarm on climate change – are critical to the survival of us all,” he said. “Small island and atoll nations like mine do not have time for paper promises,” Kabua added. Urgent pleas also came from Africa, which contributes least to global warming but stands to suffer from it the most. “In favoring solutions based on the respect for nature, we’re also preserving the health of our peoples,” said President Issoufou Mahamadou of Niger, part of the Sahel region south of the Sahara desert where temperature increases are expected to be 1.5 times higher than the world average. “Our global home that was teeming with millions of species of God-given creatures, both great and small, is slowly dying,” said Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who last year noted that his country was the only one in Africa to reach the goal of making renewable energy 75% of its energy mix."
" United under Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, young people rallied worldwide on Friday to demand urgent action to halt catastrophic climate change, in their first global protest since the coronavirus crisis began. With wild weather wreaking havoc across the world – from fires ravaging the U.S. West, to abnormal heatwaves in the Siberian Arctic and record floods in China – organisers said their aim was to remind politicians that, while the world focused on Covid-19, the climate crisis was more acute than ever. Demonstrations were planned in more than 3,100 locations, though with pandemic-related curbs limiting the size of gatherings, much of the action shifted online. In Stockholm, Thunberg and a handful of members of her group, Fridays for Future, assembled outside parliament with signs bearing slogans including “Stop Denying the Climate Is Dying”. “We need to treat the climate crisis as a crisis. It’s just as simple as that. The climate crisis has never once been treated as a crisis and unless we treat it as a crisis we won’t be able to, so-called, ‘solve’ it,” Thunberg told reporters. Organisers said turnout was expected to be far smaller than the global climate strikes held one year ago, which drew more than six million people onto the streets. Participants were asked to post pictures on social media and join a 24-hour global Zoom call - though mass gatherings were held in countries including Germany. In Berlin, police said nearly 10,000 people took part in demonstrations. Protesters cycled in groups to the Brandenburg Gate, where they sat in face masks, observing social distancing and chanting: “Strikes in school, university and companies. That is our answer to your politics”. On the Front Lines The demonstrations focussed on communities that have contributed little to greenhouse gas emissions, but are on the front lines of devastating climate threats including violent storms, rising seas and locust plagues. Activist Vanessa Nakate, who led 30 young demonstrators in Kampala, Uganda, on Friday, said the climate change debate has tended to sideline voices from vulnerable developing regions. “The world was so focused on the California fires,” she told Reuters. “When California was burning, communities in Africa were flooding - but where was the attention?” In Kenya’s capital Nairobi, about 30 activists gathered in a park, with some donning headgear made of discarded plastic bottles. Their protest centred around media reports, first published in The New York Times, that industry group the American Chemistry Council (ACC) is lobbying to ensure Kenya continues importing foreign plastic trash, despite a government pledge to stop doing this. ACC has said the reports are inaccurate. “We say Africa is not a dumpsite, and Kenya is not a dumpsite,” activist Kevin Mtai said. In the Philippines, Mitzi Jonelle Tan, a 22-year-old Fridays for Future activist, said recent flooding had wiped out a local Covid-19 testing centre and caused a tree to fall on her home. “I hate that it is a normal thing to experience these impacts. I hate that it is a normal thing that people are suffering – because they don’t need to,” she said. People in the global South are dying because of climate change, said 19-year-old Belgian activist Anuna De Wever ahead of a planned protest in a Brussels square. “As one of the richest continents, we (Europeans) have the biggest responsibility to fight climate change in the most ambitious way possible.” Mya-Rose Craig, an 18-year-old Briton, travelled to the Arctic - one of the world’s fastest warming regions - with Greenpeace to stage the most northerly protest on an ice floe. Activists in Bogota, Colombia, said they would use the event to urge their government to ratify the Escazu Accord, an agreement among Latin American and Caribbean countries that enshrines protections for those working on environmental causes.

" Several school children and youngsters took to Delhi’s streets on Friday demanding climate action from authorities as part of the Global Climate Strike. From socially distanced sit-ins to demonstrations at Vijay Chowk, climate activists across the national capital put forward their demands to the authorities during the Covid-19 pandemic. A group of protesters had gathered at the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change on Friday afternoon demanding inclusive, attainable environmental plans, among other things. Their list of demands included saving the Aravallis, improved sewage treatment plants to tackle pollution in the Yamuna, decentralized waste system, and better environment education in schools. “Most of the climate activism groups were continuing with digital strikes. The global Fridays for Future gave the call for a strike all over the world and we decided to join for the physical strike this time,” said Srijani Datta, who recently graduated from school. Protesters said they were adhering to social distancing norms and reducing the risk of spread of infection by carrying their own sanitisers, consumables and posters.

That would include maybe investing in renewables and creating green jobs in the solar and wind sector among others, investing in public and non-motorised transport,” she said. Before Covid-19 lockdown, school children and youngsters across the national capital were participating in the global ‘Fridays for Future’ movement. As a part of the strike, the protesters took to the streets on Fridays —at least once a month— to protest the government’s inaction to curb climate change. The movement was inspired by teenage Swedish activist Greta Thunberg who started the school strikes demanding change against climate change and other environmental issues. Another group of protesters did a shoe strike outside the Prime Minister’s office. Bhavreen Kandhari, one of the organisers, said less than ten people had gathered keeping in mind Covid-19 regulations. Yet, officials detained four protesters. “Since children cannot come out in large numbers and protest due to the pandemic, we placed shoes and other footwear outside to make our point and demand action. Every pair of shoe represented a Climate Striker who have been demonstrating had it not been for the pandemic,” she said."
" Like many of her generation, Mya-Rose Craig feels strongly that adults have failed to take the urgent action needed to tackle global warming and so she has headed to the Arctic Ocean to protest. Armed with a placard reading ‘Youth Strike for Climate”, the 18-year-old British activist is staging the most northerly protest in a series of youth strikes worldwide. The strikes, made famous by Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg, are resuming after a lull caused by the global coronavirus pandemic to draw public attention back to the threat posed by climate change. “I’m here to... try and make a statement about how temporary this amazing landscape is and how our leaders have to make a decision now in order to save it,” she told Reuters Television as she stood with her placard on the edge of the Arctic sea ice. “I absolutely think that my generation has always had to think about climate change... which is why as we’ve got older there’s been this massive wave of just this need for change, this demand for change when we realised the grown-ups aren’t going to solve this so we have to do it ourselves.” Craig, from southwest England, is known as “Birdgirl” online, where her blog chronicling her bird-watching experiences has attracted thousands of followers. She has travelled hundreds of miles above the Arctic Circle aboard a Greenpeace ship, Arctic Sunrise. Climate data shows the Arctic is one of the fastest changing ecosystems on the planet, with serious consequences for wildlife from polar bears and seals to plankton and algae, while the melting sea ice contributes to rising sea levels worldwide. Warming in the Arctic shrank the ice covering the polar ocean this year to its second-lowest extent in four decades, scientists said on Monday. For Craig, getting to the ice floe involved a two-week quarantine in Germany, followed by a three-week voyage to the edge of the sea ice. Craig said those who dismiss the youth protests as just a rebellious phase by her generation are wrong, and she wants those in power to stop treating climate change as a low-priority issue, raised only to appease “the lefties in the corner”. “It’s everything now and it has to be treated like that,” she said.

" For all the recent talk of global warming, climate historians hunting for past temperature extremes have unearthed what the UN weather agency calls a new record low in the Northern Hemisphere — nearly -70 degrees Celsius (-93 F) was recorded almost three decades ago in Greenland. The World Meteorological Organizations publicly confirmed Wednesday the all-time cold reading for the hemisphere: -69.6 Celsius recorded on Dec. 22, 1991 at an automatic weather station in a remote site called Klinck, not far from the highest point on the Greenland Ice Sheet. “In the era of climate change, much attention focuses on new heat records,” said WMO Secretary-General Professor Petteri Taalas in a statement. “This newly recognized cold record is an important reminder about the stark contrasts that exist on this planet.” The temperature tally surpasses the -67.8°C recorded twice at Siberian sites of Oimekon in 1933 and Verkhoyanksk in 1892. The latter Russian site made headlines in recent months for recording what may be a new record-high temperature north of the Arctic Circle during a heatwave in the region. The new low was confirmed by so-called “climate detectives” working with the WMO’s Archive of Weather and Climate Extremes in Geneva. The agency, which was created in 2007, has been poring over historic data in search of records like high and low temperatures, greatest rainfall, and even of “heaviest hailstone” and “longest lightning flash.” It said that the record came to light after “a WMO blue-ribbon international panel of polar scientists tracked down the original scientists involved” from the Klinck automatic weather station than ran for two years in the early 1990."

" The Union environment ministry on Saturday told Parliament that the Char Dham road project to connect four Hindu pilgrimage sites in Uttarakhand has not been referred to it for appraisal as it did not need to be appraised even as it has involved the loss of trees and ecological damage to the fragile Himalayas. It cited an August 2013 notification exempting all projects related to the expansion of national highways up to 100 km from the preview of the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006. The exemption was granted on the recommendation of a high-level committee constituted to review the provisions in the notification related to environmental clearance for roads, buildings, and special economic zone projects. Also read: 97 people died on-board Shramik trains, govt tells Rajya Sabha “In view of the... thresholds applicable to roads in Char Dham projects, no project has been referred to the MoEFCC [Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change] for appraisal,” the ministry told Rajya Sabha. The ministry was responding to a question on whether mandatory Environment Impact Assessment was avoided to fast-track the project and the reason for fast-tracking it in hilly and mountainous terrain. The 900-km Char Dham project will connect pilgrimage sites in Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, and Yamunotri. A Supreme Court-appointed high-powered committee has flagged environmental violations in the execution of the project, including felling of thousands of trees without approval and unsafe construction practices. The violations may have activated landslides in certain areas, it said. The Supreme Court on September 9 ruled the width of the Char Dham highway shall not exceed the 5.5 metres the Union road transport ministry has specified in 2018 for the construction of roads in the mountainous terrain. The ministry separately told Rajya Sabha that forest land larger than Delhi and slightly smaller than Goa has been approved for non-forestry purposes like mining, irrigation, and hydropower from 2008 and 2020.

" The issues of climate change and its implications on lives and agriculture are high up on the political parties’ agenda for the upcoming Bihar assembly polls with both the ruling coalition and the Opposition parties backing the idea of releasing a separate manifesto on the issue. Worried over an unpredictable weather making Bihar suffer from either floods or droughts regularly, chief minister Nitish Kumar had last year launched Jal-Jivan-Hariyali mission, which saw over 5 crore people forming a human chain across the state for conservation of environment and natural resources. “The state government has launched many initiatives to protect the environment. However, these efforts needed to be carried out and extended further in view of huge population density and burgeoning demand of the people for comfort,” said information and public relations department minister Neeraj Kumar at the consultation organized by centre for environment and energy development (CEED) one the need to prepare a climate manifesto for 2020 assembly polls here on Friday. Also Read: Election officials in Bihar told to fact check, call out fake news Kumar, who represents the JD(U), also welcomed the commitment made by other political parties including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Congress and Janadhikar Party for ecological conservation in their election manifestos. Citing the widespread impact of flooding, which hit more than 82 lakh population in the state this season, the leaders said that Bihar has been caught in a peculiar situation where some parts faced drought while some other areas grappled with deluge. “It is a matter of worry that a historic city like Patna has been rated among the worst in terms of ambient air quality, due to the government’s inability to keep it clean,” said Congress leader Harkhu Jha. BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said that the NDA government had done a lot for minimising the human loan on the earth, but still a lot was required to be done for the management of municipal wastes, extension of forest cover and reduction of natural calamity through smart ways. Also Read: Ahead of Bihar polls, PM Narendra Modi dedicates Kosi rail bridge to nation “Deputy chief minister Sushil Modi had presented a separate green budget for the purpose. The party may consider presenting a separate manifesto on the environment for the coming assembly polls,” said Anand. RJD spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwari said that Jal Jivan Hariyali mission was launched with good intentions. “But complexities in its realization and general reluctance of the bureaucracy towards the issue had pushed the state on the verge of disasters like unseasonal rains, floods, water logging and changes in the cropping patterns,” Tiwari added. Congress leader Jha said the onus for conservation of natural resources and checking ambient pollution lied equally on the society. “The government cannot alone do everything to protect the environment. The issue is high on the Congress’ priority list and it may plan presenting a separate manifesto for conservation of environment and wildlife,” added Jha. JAP spokesman Awadhesh Lalu also supported the idea for a separate manifesto on conservation of natural resources. Chief executive officer of CEED Ramapati Kumar urged the leaders of political parties to help Bihar tide over the prevailing crisis engendered by climate change that has badly impacted health of the people and prosperity of the state."
" India at the UN on Thursday cautioned against “securitisation” of environmental issues, saying linking up everything related to environmental degradation to peace and security does nothing to address climate concerns meaningfully nor does it ensure that real perpetrators adhere to their commitments on environmental issues. Environmental degradation can have humanitarian impact or effect just as many other aspects of human activity have humanitarian dimensions, India said in a statement to the UN Security Council’s high-level open debate on maintenance of international peace and security: Humanitarian Effects of Environmental Degradation and Peace and Security. “However, merely to link up everything related to environmental issues with peace and security does nothing to enhance our understanding of the problem; nothing to help us address these issues in a meaningful way and does nothing to call out the real perpetrators and make them adhere to their commitments on environmental issues or help change behaviour of people at subsistence level,” it said. India said that in many cases, perpetrators of environmental degradation may well be “outside national boundaries” while the people suffering are inside. “Is peace and security then the right paradigm to address this issue or is strengthening implementation of agreements, an appropriate and probably a more effective way to do it?” it said. India said there has been an increasing tendency both in the Security Council and outside to start discussing environmental issues with a certain “disregard” for the various important principles which govern environmental discussions, including climate change and biological diversity. Principles such as common but differentiated responsibilities are sacrosanct in this matter, it said. India cautioned that “steering away from these principles and other commitments and attempting to discuss such issues by obfuscating those responsible for addressing them will only do a disservice to the real issue rather than making it more meaningful to address them. “Consequently, linking up environmental degradation to humanitarian effect and then to peace and security does not enhance our collective effort to address environmental degradation in any meaningful way,” India said. It also said that there is need for a collective will to address such important issues multi-dimensionally without shirking commitments under important conventions such as the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, Convention on Biological Diversity, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and Paris Agreement. “What we need therefore is greater resolve to implement the commitments and contributions undertaken under environmental agreements instead of ‘securitisation’ of environmental issues,” India said.

" This year’s Nobel Peace Prize could go to green campaigner Greta Thunberg and the Fridays for Future movement to highlight the link between environmental damage and the threat to peace and security, experts say. The winner of the $1 million prize, arguably the world’s top accolade, will be announced in Oslo on Oct. 9 from a field of 318 candidates. The prize can be split up to three ways. The Swedish 17-year-old was nominated by three Norwegian lawmakers and two Swedish parliamentarians and if she wins, she would receive it at the same age as Pakistan’s Malala Yousafzai, the youngest Nobel laureate thus far. Asle Sveen, a historian and author of several books about the prize, said Thunberg would be a strong candidate for this year’s award, her second nomination in as many years, with the U.S. West Coast wildfires and rising temperatures in the Arctic “leaving people in no doubt” about global warming. “Not a single person has done more to get the world to focus on climate change than her,” Sveen told Reuters. The committee has given the prize to environmentalists before, starting with Kenya’s Wangari Maathai in 2004 for her campaign to plant 30 million trees across Africa, and in 2007 to Al Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In the era of the coronavirus crisis, the committee could also choose to highlight the threat of pandemics to peace and security, said Dan Smith, the director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. “There is a relationship between environmental damage and our increasing problem with pandemics and I wonder whether the Nobel Peace Prize Committee might want to highlight that,” he told Reuters. If the committee wanted to highlight this trend, he said, “there is obviously the temptation of Greta Thunberg”. The Fridays for Future movement started in 2018 when Thunberg began a school strike in Sweden to push for action on climate. It has since become a global protest. Thunberg and her father Svante, who sometimes handles media queries for her, did not reply to requests for comment. Many were sceptical when Greta, as she is often referred to, became the bookmaker’s favourite to win last year’s Nobel Peace Prize, especially with regards to her age, but her second nomination could strengthen her chances. “Greta is re-nominated, which was the case for Malala. I said Malala was young when she was nominated the first time and I said Greta was young the first time she was nominated,” Sveen said. Yousafzai won in 2014. NOT TRUMP Other known candidates included the “people of Hong Kong”, NATO, Julian Assange, Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden and jailed Saudi activist Loujain al-Hathloul. Other possible choices are Reporters Without Borders, Angela Merkel and the World Health Organization, experts said, though it is unclear whether they are nominated. Nominations are secret for 50 years but those who nominate can choose to publicise their choices. Thousands of people are eligible to nominate, including members of parliaments and governments, university professors and past laureates. It is not known whether Donald Trump is nominated for this year’s prize, though he is up for next year’s award after a Norwegian lawmaker named the U.S. President for helping broker a deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. He is unlikely to win, Sveen and Smith agreed, not least for his dismantling of the international treaties to limit the proliferation of nuclear weapons, a cause dear to Nobel committees. “He is divisive and seems to not take a clear stance against the violence the right wing perpetrates in the U.S.,” said Smith. “And that is just the first list.” (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

" Residents of fire-ravaged Western states, and an entire world of observers looking on in horror, have asked themselves, “How can this be happening?” As fire last week taunted Paradise, California, destroyed in the 2018 Camp Fire, many others have found themselves asking a related, but much more complicated question: How can this be happening again?” California burns. Everybody knows that. But why does it seem like forests are igniting more often? “Are these landscapes burning more frequently?” said Jon Keeley, a U.S. Geological Survey research scientist. “The answer is absolutely yes.” But beyond the aggregate numbers, that big, central question splinters into a forest of smaller ones whose answers span the latitude, longitude, and altitude of the American West. California, the focus of Keeley’s work, has its own galaxy of fire environments. To know whether fires are returning to parts of the state faster than they have before first requires some sense of the long-term “normal.” Scientists have found that mountainous and forested northern California environments experience fires much less frequently than they used to, while southern parts of the state see more of them. This passes a common-sense check, since old, slow-growing forests, as in the North, seem harder to burn down than small vegetation dried out by high-summer temperatures that occur in the South. Researchers have assembled maps of California that show how the rate of fires has changed between the time before mass human settlement to the 20th century.  The blue northern areas see fewer fires in part because of a century-long effort to stop them from happening. Until relatively recently, these less populated, more remote areas experienced blazes that were largely caused by dry lightning. That’s what happened in August, and something like it can happen every decade or so, Keeley said. The last major episode occurred in 2008. The Southern coastal areas don’t receive the same lightning. They are, however, covered with lower-lying brush and support a larger human population — which tends to start more fires, even though the same fire policies are in place there as in the North. Those are just the long-term trends. How to understand the dramatic speed of return of California wildfires in recent years requires a simplification of the many variables that cause fires — autumn winds, lightning, drought, land-use, and, yes, the wood or “fuel” backlog from a century of fire suppression and climate change.  Keeley has offered a way to simplify and clarify the factors driving the increase in fires around the state. He explains the rise of large 21st century California wildfires by comparing those that are driven by wind with those that are ‘fuel’-driven. This framework suggests that while it’s brought up frequently in public discussions, the build-up of forest fuel is only one factor in northern fires; others include land-use and development trends and past timber-harvesting practices. That said, a resumption in the forestry practice of managed burning in higher and northern areas would help. To the south, autumn winds turn human actions—power-line failures and arson—into conflagrations, and fuel is less of a factor. Whatever can burn will.  Erin Hanan, an assistant professor at University of Nevada, Reno, offers another two-part model. In some places, historically at least, there’s too much moisture for fires to grow. As some northern areas filled with fuel dry out under rising temperatures and longer fire seasons, however, moist climate is less of an impediment to fire. In contrast to these areas, she writes, there are also very dry, “fuel-limited areas,” where everything burns easily. Many places fall in-between these extremes. Against the backdrop of all these factors—California’s fire-prone geography and ecosystems, the Santa Ana and North winds, the century of fire suppression, land-development closer to forests, human activity and the overall growth in California’s population—climate change progresses. Which of these factors is responsible for the current conflagrations? All of them, Keeley said. The entire wildfire system is activated. Not only are these factors never far from Keeley’s research, they’re not far from his house.  An estimated 140 million trees died in the last decade during California’s drought, itself worsened by climate change. “Right after this occurred, I would go out on my porch and look up at the mountain beside us and it’s just covered with dead trees,” he said on Tuesday from his home in Three Rivers, California. “Now we’re paying for that because there’s a big fire that’s threatening evacuation of our house.”Eric Roston writes the Climate Report newsletter about the impact of global warming.

" Two global reports this week have indicated that the world is undergoing a massive transition in energy use and carbon dioxide emissions. The BP Energy Outlook 2020 released on Monday indicated that global CO2 emissions may have already peaked in 2019 and are likely to decline hereafter depending on how countries build back after Covid-19. It also said there is a declining role of fossil fuels, offset by an increasing share of renewable energy. The Energy Transitions Commission (ETC), a coalition of energy-producing companies, environmental NGOs, banks, et cetera., has released a report, ‘Making Mission Possible’, on Wednesday which said developed countries could reach a net-zero emissions by 2050 and developing countries like India could do so by 2060 with large scale changes in energy use. Ajay Mathur, co-chair, ETC and Director General, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) said it is possible that the global CO2 emissions have already peaked in 2019. Here are the excerpts from the interview: Q. Where will the money come from for the transition to net-zero emission (overall balance in CO2 emitted and CO2 removed) economy? A. All developing countries are growing. They are going to invest in new capital because of growing demand and also to replace existing capital stock as it finishes its life. We need the money in any case. The question is under what circumstances will that money flow? Money will flow if it is making profits. Whether it is domestic banks or international funds they will invest. Invested in renewable energy in India right now, investments will happen because investors see money coming back with a profit. If you consider the total amount of money that is needed between 2020 and 2050 is 1 to 2 percent of the additional cost to transition to net-zero scenario in this period. We need profit-making investment opportunities. (Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 would cost an estimated 1 trillion-2 trillion dollars a year of additional investments according to ETC). Also read: Russia partners with Dr Reddy’s for trials, distribution of Sputnik vaccine Q. The BP energy outlook report indicated that global CO2 emissions may have peaked in 2019? Is that possible? A. Globally, it may be possible. If the US and China have started recording declining CO2 emissions at least between 2019 and 2020 then clearly the world is on a declining path. In India, the question is slightly different. We still haven’t reached our peak electricity consumption. Everyday electricity demand is more than what it was yesterday. Where does that electricity come from? Today solar is the cheapest electricity we have but only when the sun is shining. At night coal electricity is the cheapest. In the short term, we will have a share of coal and renewable energy increase. This will continue till renewables plus storage (battery) produce electricity which costs less than coal. Last month, Solar Energy Corporation of India tenders said that solar plus storage will be provided at a price which is competitive to coal electricity in two years’ time. It will then not make sense in investing in energy generation from coal. It is quite possible that we may have peaked but like they say, ‘one swallow does not a summer make’. We have to see how things change. Q. Did the pandemic contribute to the fact that we may have peaked earlier than expected? A. We saw a peak for energy demand in February or March this year which was less than energy demand last year. How the recovery now occurs is anybody’s guess. It’s too early to say. There are many people who think the way I do who are investing in renewable energy but it’s very difficult to forecast. Q. Your report speaks about achieving net-zero emissions by 2060. What does that mean for the common man? A. For a common person, I will suggest five things. 1) Buy the most energy-efficient air conditioner you can. The largest source for the increase in demand for electricity in India is from air conditioners. We have 50 percent more efficient air conditioners than those available in 2007. 2) Anybody who has the option should set up rooftop solar. It makes economic sense. 3) Use electric two-wheelers, they make sense in urban areas. Even electric cars and taxis make sense but this will depend on the building of charging stations. 4) For industries, it makes sense to consider electricity or hydrogen instead of coal but reliability of supply matters. 5) Steel is looking at tripling capacity in the next 15 years in India. We mix coke and iron ore to make steel. Can we use something else instead? Our report talks about using hydrogen. A company in Sweden is trying hydrogen technology. We need scale to grow and prices to decline. This is the kind of picture we see till 2060 which will help the world to move toward zero carbon. Q. What are the global factors, conditions which have led to this transition in energy?"
" Covid-19 has been simultaneously good and bad for humanity’s struggle to limit global warming. So far, it’s hard to say what the net balance will be. But the European Union could tilt it positive, if it so chooses. On the good side of the ledger, global emissions of greenhouse gases plummeted during the lockdowns. On the bad side, they’re already heading back up to pre-corona levels. This year’s dip will make us no more likely to achieve our goals for slowing climate change. The recent drop in demand for energy also had perverse side-effects. The price of oil plummeted, making this fossil fuel more attractive in the recovery compared to greener alternatives. Even the damper on air travel hasn’t been unequivocally good for the climate. As airlines bought fewer emission allowances in the EU’s cap-and-trade system, the price of these certificates dropped. This made carbon pollution cheaper in other sectors of the economy, such as cement production. The pandemic’s effect on climate politics is also ambiguous. Just before the coronavirus arrived in Europe, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, had declared decarbonization the EU’s priority, with a “Green Deal” to make the whole bloc emissions-neutral by 2050. Later today, she’ll probably announce even more ambitious targets. But the Covid-19 recession has pushed ecology down a notch in urgency, below economics. The Czechs, Poles and others have suggested shelving the Green Deal to concentrate first on limiting the economic fallout of Covid-19. The fight against global warming, in their logic, amounts to a huge exogenous cost which cannot be borne during a depression. Other politicians disagree. Von der Leyen, for example, is trying to market this week’s acceleration of the Green Deal as a twofer: The huge public and private investments required for decarbonization, so goes her pitch, will simultaneously provide the fiscal stimulus to boost aggregate demand and overcome the corona recession. Thus, Europe’s rescue packages are designed to be “green” (see chart). But economists aren’t convinced that these two concurrent struggles — against recession and against global warming — are natural policy partners. The “Tinbergen rule,” named after a Nobel laureate in economics, says that if you have N different policy goals, you require at least N different policy instruments, otherwise there will be trade-offs and conflicts. For example, limiting climate change requires raising the price of carbon. But this also means higher energy costs, which dampen the recovery. Subsidizing green products, like electric cars or fuel cells, implies even more public borrowing at a time when government debt is already high, and therefore requires tax hikes sooner rather than later, which will hurt demand. And so on. But there’s a solution, and it’s one the EU should grasp and then evangelize all over the world. It’s to stop subsidizing things labelled green with public money, and to instead focus entirely on charging a price for things that are brown, then recycling the money that’s earned. As it happens, the appropriate instrument already exists. It’s that aforementioned European emissions-trading system, the world’s largest of its kind. It fixes the amount of carbon that certain industries, such as steel makers or power generators, may emit. Companies then have to buy allowances, which they can resell to other firms if they don’t need them.      "
" The Covid-19 pandemic requires societies to make critical choices about the kind of economies countries wish to rebuild, and change the way current levers of the economic structure works, a new report released on Tuesday has said. Commissioned by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and written by Sheffield University professor Michael Jacobs, it said the pandemic has raised serious challenges, coming on top of the financial crisis, climate change and inequalities of the last decade. Governments must change the way the economy works in the wake of the pandemic, said the report based on inputs by an international advisory group, calling on countries to go ‘beyond growth’ and radically reorient economic policy. The report warned that the dominant patterns of economic growth in OECD countries have generated ‘significant harms’ over recent decades – including rising inequality and catastrophic environmental degradation. It called for a paradigm shift in the way developed countries approach economic policy – so that instead of focusing on gross domestic product (GDP), they prioritise environmental sustainability, improving wellbeing, reducing inequality and strengthening economic resilience. These goals should be built into the structures of the economy from the outset, rather than hoped for as a by-product, or added after the event, it said. The report argued that this will require a new role for the state, with governments becoming more entrepreneurial, seeking to shape markets and steer the process of economic change, not simply correcting market failures. This “new kind of social contract” would transform the relationship between the state, business, civil society and citizens, said the report, titled ‘Beyond Growth: Towards a New Economic Approach’. Jacobs said: “The Covid-19 crisis needs to lead to a major reset in economic policy. Before the crisis, Western economies were already experiencing financial instability, environmental breakdown and rising inequality, so a return to the status quo would be disastrous.”"
        
" As Donald Trump on Monday toured parts of California that have been ravaged by wildfires and then reiterated his scepticism of climate change, Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger for the White House race, slammed the US president, calling him a “climate arsonist”. Trump visited California, one of 10 states where wildfires have burnt down nearly 5 million acres of land, killed dozens of people and displaced millions, after weeks of criticism of his indifference towards the crisis and after blaming it on negligent forest management practices. Local officials of Democrat-ruled California accepted the importance of forest management during their interactions with the US president, but argued that climate change should be accepted as having played a role in the devastating West Coast fires. “It’ll start getting cooler, you just watch,” the American president said dismissively after a short presentation by a California official who argued that climate change should be recognised as the real cause of the fires. The state official then told the US president, “I wish science agreed with you,” to which Trump responded, saying, “I don’t think science knows, actually.” The exchange of words went viral on social media as yet another instance of climate crisis denial by the US president. Trump had been downplaying the climate crisis right from his pre-presidency days, when he had claimed that climate change was a hoax fanned by China to slow down the growth of industrialised countries. Since taking office in January 2017, Trump has pulled the US out of the Paris Accord, claiming it had given India and China a sweeter deal, and has decidedly rolled back all clean air and water orders issued by his predecessor, Barack Obama. “Donald Trump’s climate denial may not have caused these fires, record floods and record hurricanes,” former vice-president Biden said in a speech in Wilmington, Delaware, tying the catastrophic natural events to the climate crisis. “But if he gets a second term, these hellish events will become more common, more devastating and more deadly.” Bided added, “If you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised if we have more of America ablaze?” The Democratic presidential candidate promised to take the US back to the Paris Accord that Obama as president had brokered with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping, leaders of the world’s top polluters after America."
" Ahead of the 75th United Nations General Assembly which begins in New York on Tuesday, the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), a coalition of 44 low-lying nations sounded alarm bells saying they were sinking not just because of climate change impacts like sea-level rise but are also neck-deep in debt. “We are sinking in debt. This situation has been building up for quite some time now. But with the collapse of the tourism sector due to Covid-19 pandemic, we are in a state of emergency. We need systemic changes and not short-term measures. The climate crisis is unabated. The promise of green recovery cannot be rhetoric,” said Lois Michele Young, a Belizean diplomat and ambassador of AOSIS. She called on donor, developed countries to honour their commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement. “Official development assistance is needed leading up to COP 26 in 2021. COP 2021 should have enhanced nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to keep global warming under 1.5-degrees C. We are on the trajectory for a 3 degree C rise now over pre-industrial levels. 2020 is a critical year, we have a ten-year window according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to correct the trajectory and we are at end of year one,” Young said. Also read: Won’t be enough Covid-19 vaccines till 2024: Serum Institute’s Adar Poonawalla Marla Dukharan, economist and advisor on the Caribbean, said, “Small island countries were in debt even before the Covid-19 pandemic. But now they have to borrow more and the debt to the GDP ratio is skyrocketing as economies are contracting due to the pandemic. They are in unsustainable territory and governments soon will be defaulting. A natural disaster or even Covid-19 can wipe out 40 percent of the GDP for any of these countries in a go.” Dukharan explained that high vulnerability to natural disasters, higher imports, lack of efficiency or achieving economies of scale for various public services have led to debt. According to Climate Action Tracker, only 8 countries have submitted updated NDCs; 2 have proposed updated NDCs; 7 have declined to update and 172 countries haven’t updated their NDCs.

During the peak of Covid-19 lockdown in early April, the daily global CO2 emissions dropped to 2006 levels falling by 17 percent as compared to 2019. By early June, however, daily fossil fuel CO2 emissions returned to within 5 percent below 2019 levels. But, this dip in CO2 emissions hasn’t made any impact on global co2 concentrations."
" President Donald Trump will travel to California on Monday to be briefed about its devastating wildfires while Democratic rival Joe Biden plans a speech on the matter from Delaware, bringing climate change to the forefront of the presidential campaign. Trump, a Republican who pulled the United States out of the Paris accord on global warming because he found it too costly, has expressed his view that poor forest management is partly to blame for the fires that are raging around the West Coast. Democrats have emphasized that climate change has played a role, and Biden is expected to emphasize that in his remarks. Trump will travel to McClellan Park, California to meet with local and federal officials for a briefing about the fires. “The president continues to support those who are battling raging wildfires in a locally-executed, state-managed, and federally-supported emergency response,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement on Saturday. Biden has included climate change in his list of major crises facing the United States, along with the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 194,000 and pushed the country into an economic recession. “Vice President Biden will discuss the threat that extreme weather events pose to Americans everywhere, how they are both caused by and underscore the urgent need to tackle the climate crisis, and why we need to create good-paying, union jobs to build more resilient infrastructure,” his campaign said in a statement on Sunday. A spate of deadly and destructive wildfires has hit California, Oregon and Washington this summer, destroying thousands of homes and a handful of small towns, burning more than 4 million acres and killing more than two dozen people since early August. Fighting climate change is a key, motivating issue for young people and progressive-leaning voters that Biden needs to turn out to vote in the Nov. 3 election."
" Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) has informed the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that three different models have been suggested for the producers, importers and brand owners to implement the Extended Producers Responsibility (EPR) mechanism to deal with plastic waste including pens. The NGT was hearing a petition filed by Avani Mishra, who has raised a grievance against the unchecked use of plastic pens having an adverse impact on the environment. It is submitted that 91 per cent of the plastic waste so generated is not recycled and 1600 to 2400 million pieces are brought to the market every year. Stating that the extended producers’ liability is not being duly enforced, the applicant has suggested that the policy of ‘buy-back’ be introduced. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) also responded to the court on the plea and stated that the National Framework for EPR under PWM Rules, 2018 is under consideration at MoEF&CC. CPCB has communicated to the Ministry to clearly enumerate the items to be covered under EPR. The EPR means producers take responsibility for managing the disposal of products when they are no longer useful by consumers. The NGT’s bench headed by its chairperson AK Goel has asked the Ministry to file further action taken report in this matter before the next date and listed the matter for further hearing on October 14.

" An unprecedented global climate emergency is no secret but many choose to ignore it amid the COVID-19 pandemic and Sweden’s teen activist Greta Thunberg will be shining a light on the same in her upcoming documentary ‘I am Greta Thunberg’. Featuring how the 17-year-old from Stockholm became a global figurehead for climate action, the documentary is set for a cinematic release worldwide starting October 16 but its recent trailer was enough to give viewers goosebumps. Taking to her Instagram handle, Greta shared the powerful trailer that warned of fallouts from climate change and grabbed over 1.3 million views while still going strong. The compelling, never-before-seen footage in the intimate documentary, from Swedish director Nathan Grossman, follows Greta from her one-person school strike for climate action outside the Swedish Parliament to her extraordinary wind-powered voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to speak at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York City. Grossman also tracks Greta as a shy student with Asperger’s Syndrome, her rise to prominence, meeting some of the most powerful politicians in the world and her galvanizing global impact as she sparks school strikes around the world. The trailer is sure to leave one not only emotional but also fired-up with hair standing on the end.  In cinemas worldwide starting October 16. And on hulu November 13. Here’s the official trailer: A post shared by Greta Thunberg (@gretathunberg) on Sep 12, 2020 at 5:05am PDT It premiered at the Venice Film Festival and debunks some of the criticisms on her by showing her writing her own speeches and other facts that establish her to be the sole driving force in the campaign and not her parents or other environmental interests. Grossman also documents the real the pressures that accumulated on her as the campaign grew."
" John Sykes built his life around his cabin in the dense woods of Northern California. He raised his two children there, expanded it and improved it over time and made it resilient to all kinds of disaster except fire. So when the winds started howling on Tuesday and the skies became so dark from smoke that he had to turn on his lights at midday, he didn’t hesitate to leave it all behind in an instant before any evacuation order. With the disaster two years ago in nearby Paradise, in which 85 people perished in the deadliest and most destructive fire in modern state history, still fresh on his mind, Sykes got his wife and a friend into his car and left with only a change of clothes each. “All I could do is look in the rear view mirror and see orange sky and a mushroom cloud and that told me it was hot and to keep going,” Sykes said on Friday. “It was a terrifying feeling.” Berry Creek was largely destroyed in what has become the deadliest fire of 2020, a year that has already shattered California records for the most area burned — more land than the state of Connecticut — and recorded the largest fire of all time in the state. Five of the top 10 biggest blazes in state history are still burning and fire season often gets worse in the fall. At least 10 people were killed, including Josiah Williams, 16, who couldn’t escape the flames. “He was alone, terrified and ran for his life,” his mother, Jessica Williams, told CBS13 Sacramento. “My son was a good, smart, caring young boy that died alone and it kills me thinking about what he was going through.” Neighbouring Oregon and Washington also have been besieged and air pollution is a major problem across the West. Oregon Governor Kate Brown on Friday said “dozens of people” are missing from the large wildfires that have burned across the state. California Governor Gavin Newsom toured the fire-ravaged region on Friday and strongly asserted that climate change was evident and pledged to redouble efforts to “decarbonise” the economy. “The debate is over around climate change. Just come to the state of California, observe it with your own eyes,” he said, citing the hottest August in state history, 14,000 dry lightning strikes in three days, record-breaking temperatures, drought and millions of dead trees. The immediate good news, he said, was the weather was beginning to cooperate, with winds settling down and the possibility of modest rain. Bill Connelly, a Butte County supervisor, said about 90% of the homes had burned but most of the 6,000 people in that area got out. “It’s just as devastating as Paradise,” he said, referring to the town 10 miles (16 kilometers) away that had 26,000 residents when it was destroyed. “It would be worse than Paradise if there were that many people living there.” About 20 people were hospitalised with burns; others broke limbs in the panic to flee, Connelly said. Fire officials have estimated that more than 2,000 homes and other buildings were destroyed. Under heavy smoke, the search continued on Friday for 16 people missing in the rugged mountains 125 miles (200 kilometres) northeast of San Francisco. Berry Creek, which began as a stage coach stop during the California Gold Rush, was among the hardest hit communities. A bar, laundromat and two stores are gone. All that remained of a gas station were a pair of pumps and a sign listing prices. The school and volunteer fire station — with the engine still inside — were destroyed. “There was no fighting this fire,” Sykes said. “Those who tried to fight it are probably not here.” Most homes were reduced to smoldering piles of ash, twisted metal and blackened appliances, but others escaped unscathed. Chimneys poked from the rubble and burned out cars and pickup trucks dotted the landscape. Scorched utility poles and fallen wires lined the roads. Sykes, who became emotional several times describing his ordeal, said he has located all but two friends. Some dunked into ponds, others jumped into Lake Oroville, a massive reservoir, as hot debris rained down on them, he said. Sykes, a former logger and construction worker, had never evacuated his home during a fire before but said he was too old at 68 to stay put. Plus, he had to look after his wife Janet, the “love of my life,” and a close friend who has been ill and lived with them since her husband died six months ago. He didn’t want them to be trapped on the road leading out of town the way people had perished in Paradise."
" Spreading from Washington state to Southern California, wildfires raging across parts of the US West Coast have taken at least eight lives while mandatory level three evacuation orders expand in many places along the coast. Sweden’s teen climate activist, Greta Thunberg, drew social media users’ attention on the wildfires as they doubled in size between Wednesday and Thursday as per the Oregon officials. While more than 1,000sq kms have burned in California alone over the last 24 hours, the huge wildfires are forcing firefighters in some states to retreat. Taking to her Instagram handle, Greta shared a picture of San Francisco, where the smoke and ash in atmosphere turned the sky and landscape into an apocalyptic orange. Greta asserted, “Reporting is not enough. Connecting the dots is not enough. Mentioning the link to the climate crisis is not enough (even though it would kind of help...). If we are to have a small chance, this needs to be our main focus. It needs to dominate the news. All the time (sic).”  Reporting is not enough. Connecting the dots is not enough. Mentioning the link to the climate crisis is not enough (even though it would kind of help...). If we are to have a small chance, this needs to be our main focus. It needs to dominate the news. All the time. A post shared by Greta Thunberg (@gretathunberg) on Sep 10, 2020 at 11:45am PDT Since strong winds and high temperatures are fuelling nearly 100 fires, California, Oregon and Washington state are the worst hit. Five towns in central Oregon have already been destroyed and authorities are not sure if all the residents of Malden town in Washington state made it out alive. The significant damage and devastating consequences have led to what is being suggested as the greatest loss of human life and property in recent years due to wildfires. The horrific pictures and videos coming from the West coast leave no room for climate change deniers."
" The planet is showing signs it’s in peril. In recent weeks, the world has seen ferocious wildfires in the U.S. West, torrential rains in Africa, weirdly warm temperatures on the surface of tropical oceans, and record heat waves from California to the Siberian Arctic. This spate of wild weather is consistent with climate change, scientists say, and the world can expect even more extreme weather and higher risks from natural disasters as global emissions of greenhouse gases continue. “We are seeing the emergence of some signals that would have had almost no chance of happening without human-induced climate change,” said Sonia Seneviratne, a climate scientist at Swiss university ETH Zurich. For decades, scientists have warned of such events – but have been wary of saying that a particular storm or heat wave was a direct result of climate change. That’s now changing. Advances in a relatively new field known as “event attribution science” have enabled researchers to assess how big a role climate change might have played in a specific case. In determining that link, scientists assess simulations of how weather systems might behave if humans had never started pumping carbon dioxide into the air, and compare that with what is happening today. They also factor in weather observations made over the last century or more. “What seemed like an established truth that you cannot attribute a particular extreme weather event to climate change is less and less true,” Seneviratne told Reuters. FEELING THE HEAT The clearest examples are found in the growing frequency and intensity of heat waves worldwide. Scientists needed only days to identify climate change as the key culprit in this year’s record temperatures in Siberia, with extreme heat drying out forests and peat across the Russian tundra, leading to massive wildfires. Climate change links have also been found in the simultaneous summer heat waves that hit Europe, Japan and North America in 2018. Studies found that the chances of these events happening together would have been near zero without the industrial-era rise in planet-warming carbon emissions. “When it comes to heat waves, we see that climate change is an absolute game-changer,” said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford who has helped to pioneer the field of attribution science. As a heat wave hit the U.S. West Coast last month, Earth saw a new record high temperature of 54.4 Celsius (130 Fahrenheit) in Death Valley, which sits below sea level in California’s Mojave Desert. Weeks later, the region was still broiling, with the mercury soaring Sunday to a new record of 49C for nearby Los Angeles County. “It’s not so much that climate change is destabilising historical weather patterns,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California. “In many cases, it’s amplifying them.” Hotter temperatures in turn sap the air of humidity and dry out forest and brush on land, creating perfect conditions for wildfires. In California, “the fires that we’re seeing are larger, and faster moving, and more intense than those you could have expected historically,” Swain said. But attribution science has not explained everything. For example, researchers do not yet fully understand Europe’s heat waves. “In Western Europe, the increase in heat waves is much stronger than the models predict, and we have no clue why,” said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, an attribution science expert at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute.     WIND, RAIN AND FLOODS As average global temperatures have risen by about 1C since pre-industrial times, changes in the atmosphere and oceans are also leading to more intense storms. Hurricanes overall are getting stronger and spinning slower, as they pick up energy from the heat in the oceans. Researchers at the University of Bristol in the west of England published a study last month that found that climate change could make extreme hurricane rainfall in the Caribbean five times more likely, without rapid cuts in emissions. In the United States, warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico boosted Hurricane Laura to a category 4 storm in the last hours before it slammed into Louisiana with 150 mile-per-hour (240 kph) winds. Governor John Bel Edwards described it as the most powerful hurricane to strike the state, surpassing even Katrina in 2005. Tropical cyclones spinning out from the Indian Ocean are showing similar patterns. The region has long been considered a hot spot for cyclones, with some of the deadliest storms in recent history churning through the Bay of Bengal before slamming into India or Bangladesh. Exceptionally high surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean, associated with climate change, helped Cyclone Amphan grow into a Category 5 storm in a record 18 hours before it tore into the Indian state of West Bengal in May, scientists say. The following month, Cyclone Nisarga, initially forecast to be the first to batter Mumbai since 1948, made landfall 100 km (65 miles) south of the city, with winds gusting up to 120 kph (75 mph). “Both of the cyclones were unprecedented,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. “If we go back to what led to these kinds of extreme events, what we see is that very warm ocean temperatures have played a major role.” Those warm ocean temperatures are also likely contributing to extreme rainfall and flooding in China, which this summer suffered its most punishing flood season in three decades. “The extreme rainfall events are going to become more extreme. That is something we feel pretty confident about,” said Shang-Ping Xie, a climate scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California."
" The world is getting closer to passing a temperature limit set by global leaders five years ago and may exceed it in the next decade or so, according to a new United Nations report. In the next five years, the world has nearly a 1-in-4 chance of experiencing a year that’s hot enough to put the global temperature at 2.7 degrees (1.5 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial times, according to a new science update released Wednesday by the U.N., World Meteorological Organization and other global science groups. That 1.5 degrees Celsius is the more stringent of two limits set in 2015 by world leaders in the Paris climate change agreement. A 2018 U.N. science report said a world hotter than that still survives, but chances of dangerous problems increase tremendously. The report comes on the heels of a weekend of weather gone wild around the U.S.: Scorching heat, record California wildfires and two more Atlantic storms that set records for earliest 16th and 17th named storms. Earlier this year, Death Valley hit 130 degrees (54.4 degrees Celsius) and Siberia hit 100 degrees (38 degrees Celsius). The warming that has already occurred has “increased the odds of extreme events that are unprecedented in our historical experience,” Stanford University climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh said. For example, historical global warming has increased the odds of record-setting hot extremes at more than 80% of the globe, and has “doubled or even tripled the odds over the region of California and the western U.S. that has experienced record-setting heat in recent weeks,” Diffenbaugh added. The world already has warmed nearly 2 degrees (1.1 degrees Celsius) since the late 1800s, and the last five years are hotter than the previous five years, the report said. The speed-up could be temporary, or it might not be. There’s both man-made warming and natural warming from a strong El Nino weather pattern in the past five years, said World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. “The probability of 1.5 degrees (Celsius) is growing year by year,” Taalas told The Associated Press. “It’s very likely to happen in the next decade if we don’t change our behavior.” That’s potentially faster than what a 2018 U.N. report found: that the world was likely to hit 1.5 degrees sometime between 2030 and 2052. Breakthrough Institute climate scientist Zeke Hausfather, who wasn’t part of the new report, said the document was a good update of what scientists already know. It is “abundantly clear that rapid climate change is continuing and the world is far from on track” toward meeting the Paris climate goals, he said. Some countries, including the U.S. and many in Europe, are reducing emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide, but Taalas said the world is on a path that will be 5.4 degrees (3 degrees Celsius) warmer compared with the late 19th century. That would be above the Paris accord’s less stringent 2-degree Celsius target. The latest report was the U.N.’s annual update on “climate disruption” caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas. It highlighted more than just increasing temperatures and rising sea levels. “Record heat, ice loss, wildfires, floods and droughts continue to worsen, affecting communities, nations and economies around the world,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wrote in a foreword. The report spotlights unprecedented wildfires in the Amazon, the Arctic and Australia. California is fighting record wildfires as the report was issued. “Drought and heat waves substantially increased the risk of wildfires,” the report said. “The three largest economic losses on record from wildfires have all occurred in the last four years.” Carbon dioxide emissions will be down 4% to 7% this year because of reduced travel and industrial activities during the coronavirus pandemic, but the heat-trapping gas stays in the air for a century so the levels in the atmosphere continue to go up, Taalas said. And, he said, so will the warming. So far, this year is the second hottest on record and has a 37% chance of surpassing the global record set in 2016, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

" Blue Sandford turned 17 in a police cell. Last year, she began an indefinite school strike. Now, the British environmental activist has written a book for fellow teens who want to act on climate change but do not know where to start. In Challenge Everything, which was published in Europe and North America on Tuesday, Sandford explains how the failure of governments to heed warnings from climate scientists prompted her to join civil disobedience movement Extinction Rebellion, which launched fresh protests in Britain last week. Sandford, who was arrested for blocking a road in London’s Trafalgar Square at previous demonstrations in October, uses the book to lay out a vision of a sustainable society rooted in a sense of community and connection with nature. “We can’t all just go and get arrested and that be the end of the story,” said Sandford, 17, who was arrested again at the end of August in Parliament Square, a focus of the latest protests. “I think we need to start from a place of science and empiricism and figure out the truth about the climate and ecological crisis, and then act.” Having spent much of her life living with her family on an off-grid farm on an Inner Hebrides island off the coast of Scotland, Sandford attended school in London. She chose to leave formal education in June last year in solidarity with a wave of Friday afternoon school strikes inspired by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. Sandford has since joined protests to try to stop woodland outside London, where she played as child, being felled for a planned high-speed rail link known as HS2."
           
" Snow trout, the iconic cold water fish species found in Himalayan rivers, would lose their habitat by 16 per cent in the next 30 years and by over 26 per cent by 2070, a new climate change study by the government’s Wildlife Institute of India has found. The study -- ‘Is There Always Space at The Top’-- was published in the ‘Ecological Indicators’, a journal of high international repute based at the Netherlands, on September 6. The study indicates that most of the lower altitude streams across the Himalayas would be rendered unsuitable for the existence of snow trout with the rise in temperatures. An ensemble of 72 statistical models across the Himalayas, the study -- authored by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) scientists Aashna Sharma, Vineet Kumar Dubey, Jeyaraj Antony Johnson, Yogesh Kumar Rawal and Kuppusamy Sivakumar – reveals the vulnerable snow trout would be squeezed into the high-altitude rivers in the Himalayas. “Our empirical findings strongly suggest that snow trout, a prime cold water fish of Himalayan rivers, would suffer a habitat loss in the future and the high-altitude areas would act as only saviours, provided suitable habitat connectivity is offered,” senior scientist Kuppusamy Sivakumar told PTI. The study says mountain systems across the globe are conspicuously sensitive to on-going climate alterations and the condition is much more detrimental in the Himalaya, where the rate of warming, and thus the glacier meltdown, is much higher than elsewhere. “The Himalayan coldwater species are concerningly most vulnerable to these changes because of their limited thermal range,” it says. Funded by the Department of Science & Technology (DST), the study is a part of the government’s National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem (NMSHE), which was launched to research the impact of climate change on the Himalayan ecosystem. The study iterates that if the countries across the globe continue their greenhouse emissions as usual (mentioning it as the ‘business-as-usual scenario’), “the species (snow trout) would lose a net habitat of 16.29% till the year 2050 which would further increase to 26.56% in the year 2070.” “As it stands, the snow trout faces serious threats due to river valley modifications, destructive fishing practices and exotic salmonid introductions,” it says. “Due to ongoing threats, its population size has been reduced drastically in Himalayan waters, hence listed as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List,” it adds. The fish species has great commercial and recreational value and its sole presence in the high-altitude cold waters makes it a flagship species to conserve the Himalayan rivers, the study underlines. “Already exposed to numerous anthropogenic stressors, the fate of snow trout population and many co-occurring genera can be considered explicitly at a higher risk in the Himalaya,” it adds. The also flagged the “rampant” damming of the rivers across the Himalayas, saying the presence of dams would definitely obstruct the fish mode of movements to safer havens, ultimately risking their very survival. “Our results highlight that snow trout would expand their range upwards into the high-altitude streams with a concurrent predominant range contraction in most of their lagging edges, ultimately creating a high-altitude squeeze,” the study says. The study recommends some solutions such as persuasive “conservation efforts beyond political boundaries by combined decisions of the policymakers of Himalayan countries”. It also include reducing “unsustainable harnessing of rivers for hydropower development projects and energy efficiency by improving green energy potential”. They also underscore a need to focus more on climate change science in India, more so in the Himalayas, which, the team says is “predicted to be warming at a rate much higher than the global average rate of about 0.4 °C”. The team detailed that never has such an extensive and rigorous ensemble methodology been used to understand the climate change impacts on any freshwater species in India."
" In a matter of weeks, California has been hit with two record-breaking heat waves, hundreds of blazes, freak lightning storms and dangerously poor air quality, and now unusually strong winds are threatening to knock down power lines and ignite more wildfires. That’s prompting the state’s largest utility to impose power cuts for more than 500,000 people, and with dangerous conditions stretching across the West, Portland General Electric Co. has also switched off power to some Oregon customers. The shutoffs that PG&E Corp. began late Monday are the latest blow for the disaster-weary California, where climate change is making weather ever more extreme. Temperatures have soared to records from Napa to Los Angeles. Wildfires have torched more than 2 million acres, the most in records stretching back three decades. Hundreds of thousands of people may go dark for days while trapped indoors due to wildfire smoke and Covid-19 outbreaks. Officials are responding with equally extreme measures. In August, California carried out its first rotating blackouts since the 2001 energy crisis, drawing the ire of millions who went powerless amid extreme temperatures. The Trump administration declared a power emergency, allowing power plants to run at full bore, regardless of environmental limits. The shutoffs that began late Monday are a fairly new and controversial practice, and their use last year triggered investigations while utilities defended them as necessary in the face of increasingly wild weather. Now, as a second round of ferocious temperatures abates, so-called Diablo winds sweeping in have set the conditions for even more fires. PG&E, which filed for bankruptcy last year after its equipment sparked deadly wildfires, warned the precautionary shutoffs could impact portions of 22 counties from late Monday through Wednesday, including in the Sierra foothills and North Bay. “Unfortunately, the continued hot and dry weather is going to continue to dry out vegetation across California -- and make that vegetation even more susceptible to new admissions and large fires,” Scott Strenfel, a PG&E meteorologist, said during a public briefing late Monday. PG&E, which emerged from Chapter 11 in July after agreeing to pay $25.5 billion to settle wildfire lawsuits, said preemptive shutoffs that started late Monday could leave about 172,000 homes and businesses in the dark. That could impact up to 516,000 people, based on the size of the average California household. Shutoffs were expected to affect about 104,000 customers starting from 9 p.m. local time Monday, with the remainder going down in two phases Tuesday. Some customers may not have power restored until 9 p.m. Wednesday, according to an announcement Tuesday morning. PG&E also plans to turn off about 100 transmission lines and 145 distribution lines, it said during the briefing. In Oregon, high winds have knocked out electricity to about 80,000 Portland General customers, and for the first time the company intentionally cut power to about 5,000 homes and businesses near Mt. Hood. The U.S. Forest Service said in a statement Monday that most of California “remains under the threat of unprecedented and dangerous fire conditions.” It has temporarily closed eight national forests, including Sierra National Forest. “Existing fires are displaying extreme fire behavior, new fire starts are likely, weather conditions are worsening, and we simply do not have enough resources to fully fight and contain every fire,” Randy Moore, regional forester for the forest service’s Pacific Southwest Region, said in the statement. California narrowly escaped rotating blackouts Saturday and Sunday, as temperatures soared past 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) in much of the state, squeezing the power grid to its brink. The fires only made things worse, taking down power plants and transmission lines, cutting power to 70,000 homes and businesses. While temperatures were lower Monday in some areas, officials said they were still concerned about getting through the afternoon, in part because of the fires. But in a tweet Monday night, the grid operator said it wouldn’t order power outages. The heat is poised to ebb only slightly Tuesday. Sacramento is forecast to hit 97. Oakland will be 91. And Los Angeles will be 87. The latest blazes are already wreaking havoc on the grid. The Creek Fire in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, which has scorched more than 78,000 acres, knocked out transmission from a hydro plant on Saturday. September and October typically mark the peak of California’s fire season, when plants have been sapped of moisture by the state’s dry summer. Rains most often return in October or November."
" They aren’t writing songs about it -- at least not yet -- but the super storms, wildfires, riots and flooding, on top of the pandemic, life in lockdown and the steady drip-drip of bad news about jobs and the economy has given rise to a state of near-constant low-key dread, which has a name. Apocalypse anxiety. While the term is new, the feeling isn’t . Every few decades, the human race becomes convinced that its world is ending. There is usually a good reason: war, Cold War, nuclear war, bio-weaponry, holocausts, terrorism, climate change, economic meltdowns,and pandemics. This time, it comes from the sense that overlapping clouds of threat — deaths in the hundreds of thousands, tumbling GDP numbers, more waves of the disease and new illnesses, loneliness and isolation — are looming over all of us; that life, work, and play will never be the same again. The dread is exacerbated by a behaviour captured by another recent term -- doomsurfing or doomscrolling on social media, addictive stream of little nuggets, overwhelmingly made up of terrible news. WHAT YOU CAN DO TO COPE (A BIT) BETTER 1. A popular post doing the rounds on Twitter asks what you would do if your currently line of employment went extinct. That’s a good place to start — since, one way or another, the 2020s look set to be a decade of retooling, as existing jobs disappear and are replaced by ones that didn’t exist before. 2. Ask yourself what you can do that lies at the intersection of your experiences, skill sets and passion — “because that can be where you make a difference in the world,” Schmidt says. 3. Aim to become less outcome-dependent, and more able to do the work that needs to be done in a given time. 4. Do your bit for the environment. It will give you a sense of positive contribution too. 5. Focus on self-care. Exercise, spend time in the natural world and add meditation / mindfulness practices to your day. “The element of intensifying natural disaster — as opposed to disasters such as war and terrorism, caused directly by man — is making this a more anxiety-inducing time for us. While humans are an incredibly adaptable species, it’s becoming clear that droughts, forest fires, flooding and intensified storms will be our new normal,” says Laura Schmidt, founding director of the Good Grief Network, a US-based non-profit that specialises in outreach and support for those with eco-anxiety. For Schmidt, the virus is an extension of that. “We also know that vector-borne illnesses and viruses are increasingly probable as we continue to encroach on wildlife habitat. Looking into the future causes a tremendous amount of anxiety, fear, and grief for many people who are paying attention to our interlinked biosphere, social and climate crises.” Neither eco-anxiety nor apocalypse anxiety has been recognised as a medical condition in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. But in 2017, a report by the American Psychiatric Association described the first as a source of feelings of loss, helplessness and frustration caused by “watching the slow and seemingly irrevocable impacts of climate change unfold, and worrying about the future”. That’s what apocalypse anxiety feel like. People never prone to anxiety are waking up in the middle of the night unable to breathe. Some are becoming obsessed with numbers (Covid dashboards abound; this newspaper runs one of the most popular ones); others are refusing to acknowledge them altogether. The overwhelming sense is one of helplessness. It’s not just that something is happening; it’s that it’s part of a chain you have no control over, and almost everyone is vulnerable. “We’ve come to see our current problems as being so much bigger than eco-anxiety and climate grief. It’s the grief of waking up to the severity of our predicament as familiar life-supporting systems, both natural and man-made, are seen to quake,” Schmidt says."
" Shifting monsoon patterns linked to climate change likely caused the rise and fall of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation, according to a study by an Indian-origin scientist which analysed data from North India covering the past 5,700 years. The analysis by Nishant Malik from Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in the US used a new mathematical method to study ancient climate patterns in North India over time, providing insights about past climates using indirect observations. The research, published in Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science, noted that by measuring the presence of particular chemical forms in stalagmite mineral deposits in caves in South Asia, scientists could develop a record of monsoon rainfall in the region for the past 5,700 years. However, Malik said studying ancient climate time series with mathematical tools typically used to understand climate is a challenging task. “Usually the data we get when analysing paleoclimate is a short time series with noise and uncertainty in it. As far as mathematics and climate is concerned, the tool we use very often in understanding climate and weather is dynamical systems,” Malik said. “But dynamical systems theory is harder to apply to paleoclimate data. This new method can find transitions in the most challenging time series, including paleoclimate, which are short, have some amount of uncertainty and have noise in them,” he explained. While there are several theories about why the Indus Valley Civilisation declined, including invasion by nomadic Indo-Aryans and earthquakes, climate change appears to be the most likely scenario, the study noted. However, Malik said there was no mathematical proof until the new hybrid approach was applied. According to his analysis, there was a major shift in monsoon patterns just before the dawn of this civilisation and that the pattern reversed course right before it declined, indicating it was in fact climate change that caused the fall. The RIT scientist believes the new method will allow scientists to develop more automated methods of finding transitions in ancient climate data, leading to additional important historical discoveries.

" The ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) has sought responses from the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) and the Uttarakhand government about the alleged violations of the forest conservation act during the construction of the Char Dham Pariyojana in Uttarakhand. The ₹12,000-crore Pariyojana, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in December 2016, aims to build an 889-km all-weather road, connecting the Hindu pilgrimage sites of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri in the Himalayas. The issue of environmental violations in the project is being heard by the Supreme Court (SC), and the case is due to come up on September 8. While there has been criticism of the project on environmental grounds (recent landslides in the state prove once again that it is risky to build in the ecologically-fragile zone), its plan of action illustrates how the Indian State has flouted procedures to push the project through. One, the government used a legal loophole to avoid conducting the mandatory Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), including public hearings, to fast-track the project. Two, official agencies refused to abide by SC orders on stoppage of work. And, three, it suppressed a MoRTH’s revised circular on the contentious issue of road standards in hilly and mountainous terrains to go ahead with its road-widening plans."
" The Bering Sea ice cover during the winters of 2018 and 2019 hit new lows not seen in thousands of years, scientists reported on Wednesday, adding to concerns about the accelerating impact of climate change in the Arctic. Satellite data provides a clear picture of how sea ice has changed over the last four decades in the region between the Arctic and northern Pacific oceans. Beyond that, the only ice records available were those recorded in ship logs and other observations. So scientists turned to peat land, which holds organic compounds from plants dating back millennia, on the remote St. Matthew island off Alaska. By examining different forms of oxygen molecules trapped in the sediment, the scientists were able to estimate atmospheric and ocean conditions that would have affected rainfall and sea ice over some 5,500 years, according to the study published in the journal Science Advances. “The island in itself has acted as its own weather station,” said study co-author Matthew Wooller, director of the Alaska Stable Isotope Facility at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The sediment layers in the peat cores serve as a “book going back in time.” With the Arctic warming rapidly in recent decades, the extent of sea ice over the northern polar region has steadily waned. This year saw the summertime Arctic sea ice hit its lowest level for July in 40 years of record keeping. Sea ice builds up again each year during the winter. But the new study suggests that, in the Bering Sea, cold-season ice maximums may also be in decline. The loss of sea ice is already impacting Arctic wildlife, including walruses, polar bears and seals, with consequences for indigenous communities that rely on hunting for their livelihoods. Shrinking sea ice also exacerbates warming in the region, as ice is replaced by patches of dark water that absorb solar radiation rather than reflecting it back out of the atmosphere. “Obviously, if we lose the sea ice you are completely changing the temperatures of the Arctic,” said Julienne Stroeve, a climatologist with National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Boulder Colorado not involved in the study. “If you lose it all, you’re going to warm up the region even faster.” Air temperature wasn’t the only factor found to be affecting sea ice, though. Shifts in ocean and atmospheric circulation linked to climate change have an even bigger impact, said lead author Miriam Jones, a geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey. “There’s a lot more going on than simply warming temperatures,” Jones said. “We’re seeing a shift in circulation patterns both in the ocean and the atmosphere.” The study noted that changes in sea ice appeared to lag at least several decades behind changes in atmospheric greenhouse gases. That implies that the recent lows in winter sea ice were a response to greenhouse gas levels decades ago. The researchers checked their findings against four decades of satellite data on the sea ice. Stroeve suggested that the study could have been strengthened with more comparisons against observational data gathered by ships and whaling expeditions dating back to the mid-nineteenth century.

" The pattern of monsoon in India could undergo a major shift by the end of this century with southern India likely to register the maximum increase in extreme rainfall compared to states in central and north India, researchers from the Indian Institute of Kharagpur in West Bengal have said. The scientists have also projected that extreme rainfall may increase in the Arabian Sea and south-Asian countries, including Myanmar, Thailand and Malaysia. “In the worst-case scenario of climate change, rainfall could increase by 2.7 mm per day in north India with the Himalayan foothills expected to receive the heaviest rain. In south India, rainfall could increase by 18.5 mm per day with the Western Ghats expected to be battered the most,” said Rajib Maity, a professor of civil engineering at IIT Kharagpur, who led the study. All these could be witnessed by the fag-end of this century, in the last three decades between 2071 and 2100. The researchers analysed data of Indian Summer Monsoon precipitation for close to five decades (1971 – 2017), considering the period between 1930 and 1970 as the base. The results have been published in the Scientific Reports journal brought out by the Nature publishing group. “Our analysis shows a change in the direction of the southwest monsoon winds blowing towards the east over the Indian Ocean. This directional change will intensify the already observed precipitation contrast in future between South and North India, and cause more extreme precipitation events in countries like Myanmar, Thailand and Malaysia” Maity added. The researchers said that the Indian Ocean Dipole – popularly referred to as the ‘Indian Nino’ because of its similarity to its Pacific equivalent – is intensifying which could lead to increase in rainfall activity throughout India. The Indian Ocean Dipole refers to the difference in sea-surface temperatures in opposite parts of the Indian Ocean which, in turn, affects rainfall pattern. As the Indian monsoon plays a crucial role in agriculture, which engages nearly half of the country’s population a possible shift in the rains, as projected by the IIT study, could have a significant impact on agriculture. “South Asia, as we know, despite advances in irrigation systems, is highly dependent on the monsoons. Results of this study will be useful to the designers of water infrastructure and agricultural communities, especially in the southern parts of India and Himalayan foothills, to prompt a possible change in design criteria and agricultural practices including cropping pattern,” Virendra Tewari, director, IIT Kharagpur was quoted as saying in a statement."
" The Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) of the Ministry of Environment and Forests for coastal regulation zone (CRZ) clearances has recommended the formation of a mangrove cell across all coastal states, similar to Maharashtra, for better protection of mangroves. Mangroves are salt-tolerant plants, trees, shrubs or ground fern of tropical and subtropical intertidal regions of the world. While being a breeding ground for a variety of marine animals, they also act as a natural buffer against storm surges, cyclones and sea level rise. Considering the need for their conservation, a dedicated cell under the forest department can help safeguard mangrove forest patches and appraise planned projects around them better through site verification on affected mangrove trees, the EAC said, adding, “In Maharashtra, a mangrove conservation cell administered by the forest department is effectively functioning and a similar model can be adopted by other coastal state governments.” A formal recommendation was sent to the Union environment ministry last week. “The committee desired that the matter can be looked into by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change and in the interest of mangrove conservation, which plays a major role specially during extreme events in coastal areas, the coastal state governments or union territories’ administration may be requested to develop such dedicated mangrove conservation efforts,” read the minutes. This is a well-established model of the Maharashtra government where there is a recognised institutional framework constituted in protecting mangrove cover, said Deepak Apte, chairman, EAC (CRZ). “We have been highlighting this since our very first meeting and the Centre should take this forward in light of coastal and marine conservation. The Maharashtra model has appropriate accountability with the cell headed by a high ranking forest officer further reporting to the chief wildlife warden, and governing council state secretaries,” said Apte. The EAC made its latest recommendation while assessing the feasibility of a ₹2286 crore six-lane highway project in Kerala (Talapady to Nileshwaram section of NH-66) that involved the loss of 266 mangrove trees. According to the Forest Survey of India, the country has 4,975 sq. km of mangrove cover. West Bengal (majorly Sunderbans) has maximum cover 2,112 sq km followed by Gujarat 1,177 sq km, Andaman and Nicobar Islands 616 sq km, Andhra Pradesh 404 sq km, Maharashtra 320 sq km, and Odisha 251 sq km, among major regions with mangrove forests. Maharashtra’s mangrove cell was constituted in 2012 based on an order passed by the Bombay high court in 2005 banning mangrove destruction across the state and construction within 50 m of trees. Over eight years, the cell recruited staff for on-ground surveillance. It now has 70 forest guards across six Konkan districts, 13 round officers, and a special team engaged in tackling mangrove destruction across Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane called the Mumbai Mangrove Conservation Unit (MMCU) with 108 guards alone and a team of senior forest officers. Additionally, there is one range forest officer across all other districts including Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg. The cell is responsible for the declaration and protection of the 16.9 sq km Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary and the protection of the Malvan Marine Sanctuary. It recently proposed the 2,011 sq km Angria Bank, a submerged plateau 105 km (56.7 nautical miles) off Malvan in the Sindhudurg, as a protected area, which was approved by the State Board of Wildlife last month. The state constituted the Mangrove and Marine Biodiversity Conservation Foundation in 2015, an autonomous body that assists the mangrove cell in coastal marine conservation through research projects with mangrove cell chief as its executive director. Over five years, the foundation has undertaken numerous research projects to improve the livelihood of coastal communities as well as increase awareness and capacity building through marine biodiversity research along the Konkan coast. According to mangrove cell officials, the foundation is registered as a society where funds are allocated to offset environmental implications by project proponents as one of the conditions during wildlife clearance (mostly 2% of total project cost) issued by the National Board of Wildlife. “This money is sent to fixed deposits and the foundation uses the interest to fund its activities thereby not depending on government funds at all,” a forest official said. Apte added, “This is an effective mechanism wherein instead of companies spending money on their own (where effectiveness cannot be monitored), funds are allocated either for mangrove conservation or marine research through annual plans developed by this foundation. Thus, funds to offset environmental impacts for projects are channelised through a well-established structure governed ultimately by the state for coastal and climatic resilience.” Over the eight years since the inception of the cell and five years since the foundation was constituted, Maharashtra recorded the highest increase in mangrove cover (37%) across India between 2015 (222 sq km) and 2017 (304 sq km), and second highest increase in mangrove cover in India (by another 16 sq km) between 2017 and 2019. FIRST STATE TO DECLARE ITS OWN MANGROVE STATE TREE Maharashtra is set to become the first coastal state to declare a state mangrove tree species - Sonneratia alba or mangrove apple - based on a proposal by the mangrove cell, which was approved by the State Board of Wildlife during a meeting last month."
                
" An overflowing Narmada threw life out of gear in parts of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat and water released from the Hirakud dam flooded several districts of Odisha on the weekend. At least 24 people were killed in flooding in MP and Odisha and thousands were displaced as heavy rainfall lashed other parts of India, causing reservoirs to overflow. Rainfall has been 25% more than normal in August, which India Meteorological Department (IMD) says is the highest for the month in 44 years. The previous highest in August was recorded in 1983, when rain was 23.8% more than the normal. Here’s a quick look at reasons for flooding in central India: • Persistent very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall, measuring over 20 centimetres (cm), was recorded in two-three days between August 25 and 27 in Odisha and from August 27 to 30 over Madhya Pradesh (MP). MP’s Chhindwara district’s 12 weather stations recorded between 20 and 41 cm of rainfall on August 28 to 29. Chaurai recorded 41 cm in a day. India Meteorological Department (IMD) authorities are still assessing the data to come to the conclusion whether this is the highest-ever precipitation recorded on a day. Gujarat region continues to record very heavy rain. • A well-marked low-pressure area had formed over the Bay of Bengal, which moved very slowly from August 24 to 31 up to western Rajasthan bringing extremely heavy rainfall in its path. “Our analysis shows extremely heavy spells over MP were recorded only during one day between August 28 and 29 that triggered flooding. There is no likelihood of another low-pressure area forming over the Bay of Bengal immediately,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre (NWFC), IMD. • Now, rain will gradually reduce over central India and will begin over the northern plains, according to scientists. “Extremely heavy rain in MP and other parts of central India is mainly because of the formation of strong low-pressure area over western MP and eastern Rajasthan. We are expecting rain to decrease gradually over central India but Gujarat may experience very heavy rains for one more day. Rains will increase over the northern plains, when the monsoon trough shifts northwards around Wednesday (September 2),” said Dr Mrutyunja Mohapatra, director-general, IMD. • Such unusually heavy rains led to rivers flowing at extreme flood situations. It signifies that the highest flood level is breached. Stretches of Mahanadi, Wainganaga and Narmada rivers are still flowing in extreme flood situations. Eight dams in Odisha, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and MP are at 100% capacity and will have to release water to accommodate more rainfall. • While the floods have disrupted lives in these states, the excess rainfall can improve soil moisture and help with a good crop during the upcoming rabi season. “There are different ways of harvesting water. But the most important source of water for agriculture is groundwater. The focus should be on local storage and recharge systems. We have to store rainwater and avoid its run-off,” said Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator, South Asia Network of Dams, Rivers and People. • The country has recorded 26.3% excess rains in August –-- the highest in 44 years with 61.5% excess over central India, 36.7% excess over the southern peninsula, 19.1% deficient over east and the north-east and 1.9% excess over the north-west parts of the country. Scientists have not linked the current spell with climate change, but central India has been recording a rising trend in extreme heavy rain events. According to “Assessment of Climate Change over the Indian Region”, a report of the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) released earlier this year, showed that from 1950 onwards there has been a significant rising trend in the frequency and intensity of extreme heavy rainfall events over central India, along with a decreasing trend in the moderate rain events."
                
" Due to the Covid-19 lockdown across India this year’s carbon emissions are predicted to fall by around eight per cent, a senior official of the environment ministry has said. During a virtual session organized by PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Wednesday on ‘Paradigm Shift in Business Sustainability – Strategies to Meet the Challenges in the Post Covid-19 scenario’, Sujit Kumar Bajpayee, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, said the pandemic has given an opportunity to jump start economies. “The pandemic has given a lot of challenges but it has given the opportunity to jump start the economies, rebuild societies through recovery plans and focus on climate change and environment conservation,” he said. Talking about the importance of environment and conservation of natural resources, he also insisted on the importance of bio-diversity. “We need to realize that our life and livelihood revolves around nature and the environment,” he said. “Due to the Covid-19 lockdown across India, carbon emissions are predicted to fall by around eight per cent in 2020,” Bajpayee said. He pointed out that “nature” is an essential source of many medicines and industries like construction, agriculture, food and beverages are highly dependent on it.  “Such industries require direct extractions of resources from the forest or rely on ecosystem services such as healthy soil, clean water, and a stable climate. Due to many reasons we are losing species and many have gone extinct, that has disrupted the eco-system,” he said. Bajpayee further said the impact of this pandemic is “so complex” that it will continue to be analyzed for years to come. He added that climate change and the pandemic are related to anthropogenic activities. “Due to the pandemic, many businesses need to change their models of sustainability and understand that we all need to take ownership of the future,” he said. Speaking at the session, D K Aggarwal, President, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry deliberated upon the improvement in the quality of air and water which he described as the “silver lining of the pandemic”.  “We could see the goodness of nature due to the lockdown and, we can see that nature had taken its course of stabilizing the things,” he said. Talking about business sustainability, he said in today’s times it’s driven towards contribution to the environment and society. “The environment is pivotal, we owe our duty and responsibility towards it to ensure that we do not pollute or damage it. In these times, many companies are investing their fund in Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) companies. We need to give back to the planet, people, and profit to sustain the environment,” he added. J P Gupta, Chairman, Environment Committee, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry said environment is a key driving factor for running industries and there is a need to be considerate towards the environment for sustainability and growth. Under the Paris Agreement, India had pledged to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 30-35 per cent by 2030 and create an additional carbon sink of 2.5-3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent through additional forest cover by 2030."
" A platform of ice surrounding Antarctica measuring more than 350,000 square miles (900,000 sq km) is at risk of collapse as the effects of climate change threaten to destabilise it, a new study has shown. The floating ice shelves that extend from the world’s largest ice sheet into the sea could split if fractures on their surface are flooded by meltwater as the climate warms. Sudden loss of these supportive structures could rapidly accelerate the flow of ice into the ocean, raising sea levels around the world, with previous studies suggesting the rise could be as much as one metre by 2100. Ice shelves float on the ocean but are fastened to land and act as stoppers that prevent Antarctic ice sheets, that are as big as the United States and Mexico combined, from sliding into the sea. When they melt away from those anchor points, the flow of ice into the ocean speeds up, accelerating sea level rise. The study led by researchers from Columbia University in the United States and involving Edinburgh University, Utrecht University and Google estimated around 60 percent of the ice-shelf area was vulnerable a process called hydrofracturing. It is a process where meltwater repeatedly refreezes and thaws again, enlarging fractures in those sections of ice and putting them at risk of collapse. Martin Wearing, of the University of Edinburgh’s School of GeoSciences, who took part in the study, said: “We’ve seen in the past that the sudden collapse of ice shelves can trigger rapid acceleration of the glaciers that flow into them, and, in turn, sea-level rise.” “We have found that stresses within vast sections of Antarctica’s ice shelves are sufficiently large that they could collapse if, as climate models predict, surface melting increases substantially in coming years.” The study, which used machine learning and artificial intelligence software to examine satellite images, adds to a list of alarming research on the Antarctic’s ecosystem this year. One study released in February shortly after the region saw its highest temperature on record at 18.3 degrees Celsius (64.9 degrees Fahrenheit) warned global warming was leading to an “irreversible” mass melting of Antarctic ice.

" The Union Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has given relief to public sector undertakings (PSUs) and central government-run projects that are being executed by state agencies. The ministry has allowed these agencies to take up compensatory afforestation in degraded forest land instead of non-forest land. Increasingly, acquiring large stretches of non-forest land is posing a problem for projects that are required to conduct compensatory afforestation against the diversion of forest land. Compensatory afforestation for large central projects such as the Char Dham road in Uttarakhand or 22 green expressways, being built at an estimated cost of ₹3.10 lakh crore comprising 7,500 kilometres, by the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) are likely be exempted from taking up afforestation in non-forest land following the MoEFCC’s relaxations. Experts said the new policy sets a precedent for many central projects being executed by state agencies to take up compensatory afforestation in double the degraded forest land, as against non-forest land. But the move may impact forest biodiversity and also the rights of forest dwellers. MoEFCC’s forest conservation division had sent a letter on August 18 to all principal secretaries (forests) of all states and union territories (UTs). “It has been decided that MoRTH/central government agencies will be entered as a “user agency” in the online application form in Parivesh portal, in such cases, where work that is of central sector projects and is owned, developed and maintained by central government but the execution is carried out by a state agency,” the letter had stated. “As the user agency is MoRTH (central Government) or a central PSU, the dispensation of compensatory afforestation over double the degraded forest land, instead of equivalent non-forest land will be available in such cases,” the letter added. In case of any violation of provisions under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, or matters related to residual responsibility, the Centre will be held accountable. “This clarification applies to projects that are fully funded by central agencies. The centre doesn’t have any land of its own for compensatory afforestation. Hence, this clarification was needed. PSUs and government projects were always exempted from taking up plantation in non-forest land. But now those being executed by state agencies have also been exempted,” said Sanjay Kumar, director- general (D-G) of forests, MoEFCC. “Most highway projects are also executed by state agencies such as the state public works departments (PWDs). The Char Dham project also has state agencies executing many stretches apart from National Highways and Infrastructure Development Limited (NHIDCL) and Border Roads Organisation (BRO),” said an official from MoRTH. Though the Forest Survey of India considers forests with tree canopy density less than 10% as degraded, the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) had clarified last year that forest lands having crown density below 40% shall only be treated as degraded forest land for the purpose of compensatory afforestation."
" Amid a declining trend of rainfall in Uttarakhand, an analysis of data of the past century shows that vegetation development and regeneration is being affected in the Himalayas in the state. The recent State of Environment report of Uttarakhand, released by the Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board (UEPPCB) states that certain plant species like Sal, Oak, Telonj Oak are dependent on monsoon rain for regeneration. “Due to fluctuation in monsoon period and changes in temperature their regeneration and flowering time is getting affected... Lichens are also gradually shifting towards higher elevation due to the warming in the Chopta-Tungnath landscape (approximately 12,000 feet high), which comes under Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary protected area,” the report states. The rainfall pattern in Uttarakhand during 1911-2012, shows that the fluctuation in the quantum of rainfall is quite evident. Apart from Haridwar, all the districts in the state are in rainfall deficit, says the report. “It is quite evident that the hilly regions of the state are becoming drier while the rainfall is declining from south to north and from west to east. It is noteworthy that except for the months of March, May and November, other months are rainfall deficient.” The report also mentions that studies found that “xerophytic plants like Euphorbia royleana are gradually invading upward specifically in the tectonic valley of Kakarighat in Almora district. Due to the increase in temperature the aridity of the place rises which causes shifting in vegetation.” Similar changes have been noticed for palm trees and Lichen in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary. “Upward invasion of such colonies of the palm trees is a sharp signature of aridity and beginning of the process of desertification in the region being accelerated by climate change.” SP Subudhi, member secretary of UEPPCB said that in a cold climate, tree species are visible till a particular height known as treeline, which is shifting upwards now. “Due to climate change and an increase in temperature, the treeline is shifting upwards. With a rise in temperature, the plant species are adapting themselves and they are growing in areas where they find the suitable temperature needed for them to grow. With the upward shifting of the treeline, the position of glaciers will shrink, which can lead to disasters in the future,” said Subudhi. A district-wise breakup of decrease in rainfall shows Chamoli, Udham Singh Nagar, Rudraprayag, Pauri Garhwal, Tehri Garhwal, Uttarkashi and Dehradun are districts witnessing decreasing rainfall. The decrease in rainfall is even more pronounced in the districts of Champawat, Pithoragarh, Bageshwar, Almora and Nainital. RK Srivastava, professor and head of department on environmental sciences at GB Pant University of Agriculture and Technology said that with change in rainfall, temperature also changes and vegetation which is at the bottom keep on shifting higher to find conditions they are acclimatised to and thereby causing a change in the treeline. “The shift in treeline happens through the natural ecosystem with seeds being dispersed by natural forces, animals and birds. It is only happening due to change in climate as the temperature is rising in the current height where trees are growing. With the shift in timberline, the whole ecosystem of the area changes,” said Srivastava."
       
" Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has run into a conflict with the city-state’s forest department over suspected violations of guidelines that don’t permit construction on deemed forest land and for damaging trees during work on the Janakpuri-RK Ashram corridor in Phase 4, and has been issued orders to stop work at least twice between February and August and, most recently, August 7. This includes the area around the Najafgarh drain, which is a birding hotspot frequented by thousands of migratory birds. Once classified as forest land, trees on the stretch cannot be cut or pruned for construction unless the required permissions are sought from the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. Such work also requires the usual permissions under the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994.   Documents accessed by Hindustan Times show that DMRC, which began preliminary work on the 17-km stretch in December, was slapped with two notices on February 28 and August 7 by the Delhi forest department for damaging and pruning trees without obtaining permissions from the department and was ordered to stop work on the stretch. It also filed a violation report on August 18 with the Union ministry of environment and forest and chief conservator of forests, Delhi government, accusing DMRC of causing severe damage to trees, disturbing the ecology of the area and for continuing work on the stretch without permissions despite warnings. “The officials of this division have inspected the site, and it has been reported that one tree has been completely felled due to excavation work in Keshopur district park, and roots of a few other trees in the project area have been found damaged due to digging work. In addition, many trees have been covered by barricading and the area around the Najafgarh drain has been filled with soil,” said the first restraining order issued by the deputy conservator (west division) on February 28. The order added, “...you (DMRC) are directed to cease all digging work near trees and take necessary steps to save trees by putting soil on the roots exposed by digging and excavation work...The portion of the Najafgarh drain coming in the alignment is a site of plantation done by the IFCD (Irrigation and Flood Control Department) and GNCTD (Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi), so you are also directed to cease all construction activity on the drain area until necessary approval.” Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai did not comment on the matter. Paying no heed Despite the order to cease work, DMRC has continued to work on the stretch. In a response to HT’s email queries , DMRC said that 2,958 trees are proposed to be cut between Krishna Park and Mukarba Chowk for the construction of the corridor. Hindustan Times visited the construction site at least five times between February and August and found that the DMRC has continued construction on the stretch despite the restraining orders. Another notice was issued to the DMRC on August 7 by the office of the Deputy Conservator of Forests (west), which stated that damage to trees continued on the stretch because digging work was under way despite the lack of permissions. Inspections conducted by forest department officials between February 25 and July 28 showed that six fully grown trees on the stretch were illegally uprooted or over-pruned during construction. The digging and construction work, leading to the tree damage, continues even though senior forest department officials have confirmed that DMRC, as of August 13, was yet to submit a permission request for tree felling or transplantation on the Janakpuri-RK Ashram corridor . “I am yet to receive the permission request by the DMRC for the Janakpuri-RK Ashram stretch. If there are any violations then strictest of actions will be taken,” said Ishwar Singh, principal chief conservator of forests. DCF (west) S K Muan Guite said that the most recent reminder to stop construction work was issued to the DMRC in a meeting on August 14. “They have been intimated several times in various notices and restraining orders that the area is a deemed forest and they cannot carry out any construction work here till they obtain necessary permissions from the MoEF {ministry of environment and forest} to divert the land for the project . My staff inspected the site and told DMRC officials to stop the work despite which it has come to my notice that work is still going on,” Guite said. Records maintained by the forest department show that a portion of Road Number 26, where the Metro construction activity is currently ongoing and which spans nearly 5.3 kms in length, has been categorised as “deemed forest land” by the government. DMRC, however, said that the exact location of the deemed forest land “could not be established by the forest department”. Guite said the identification of the deemed forest was carried out using satellite imagery in 2002 and the DMRC was informed of it. In Delhi’s context, a deemed forest is one which is spread across an area of at least 1 hectare and the number of trees per hectare is 250 or above. If both conditions are fulfilled simultaneously, the area is considered a deemed forest. Police complaint He added that since the matter falls under the purview of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, which comes under the jurisdiction of the MoEF, the department does not have the authority to book a case. “In this case, I have submitted a report of the violations to the state headquarters a few days ago. The chief conservator of forests (CCF), who is the nodal officer {for FCA,1980},may report the violations to the MoEF,” Guite said. He added that a complaint was also sent to the local police station. Responding to the allegations, DMRC, in its statement, said that the preliminary work on the stretch was initiated on permissions from the Public Works Department (PWD). The corporation claimed that their work is ongoing in sections where “there are no trees”. “Work at the location where trees are there shall be taken up only after permission from Forest Department for which application had already been sent on April 2018 and subsequently in September 2019. The tree cutting permission from forest department is awaited,” DMRC said in the statement. In the response, it also claimed: “DMRC has not damaged any tree on the Vikaspuri- Madhuban Chowk road”. “Tree protection measures are being taken by DMRC’s contractor at work site and the existing trees are protected with the help of fencing with green garden net as per the suitability. Further, many other utility owning agencies are also working / digging on ROW (right of way) for their respective utilities,” it added, passing the buck for the damage. . Ravi Agarwal, founder of environmental NGO Toxics Link and a former member of the Ridge Management Board (RMB), said DCF has the authority to stop work and take legal action against DMRC for continuing work despite warnings."
" The changes in glaciers in the Nanda Devi region of Central Himalayas in Uttarakhand in the last three decades have majorly affected the lifestyle, culture and agricultural practices of people living in nearby villages, says a study carried out by experts from major institutes including IIT Kanpur, Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG), Uttarakhand Space Application Centre (USAC) and HNB Garhwal Central University in Uttarakhand. The research conducted on the ‘changes in glaciers and associated drivers for the last three decades, Nanda Devi region, Central Himalayas’ was done by studying the state of glaciers from 1980 till 2017 through extensive ground surveys and satellite imagery. During the study, which started in 2002 and was completed in 2018 before getting published in a science journal last month, it was found that about 26 sq km of the glaciated area of the Nanda Devi region was lost in 37 years which affected the people living in nearby areas. MPS Bisht, director of USAC, who was among the researchers involved in the study said, “The changes in the glaciated areas had a major effect on various aspects of the life of people living in about 47 villages in the buffer zone of the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve hosting the Nada Devi glaciers.” “It was found that the people in those villages who used to wear heavy winter clothing due to low temperatures, had stopped wearing them due to climatic changes in the last few decades which have caused the receding of glaciers there,” said Bisht. Agricultural practices and housing changed The locals in the region were now growing a wide variety of vegetation which points to a change in the agricultural practices as well. “Their agricultural practices have also changed as earlier they used to grow only buckwheat, potato and kidney beans. But now they have started growing green vegetables also due to the change in temperature and climate over the last three decades,” Bisht added. During the ground surveys for the study Bisht and other researchers also found that food habits and housing designs have also changed. “First they used to build houses with logs and grass on the roofs to bear the snowfall. But now, due to the climatic changes, the snowfall has stopped but rains have started due to which they are now using tiles on the roofs which used to be unthinkable a few decades ago,” he said. Also Read: Report urges action on tidal flooding, beach erosion due to environmental damage On the food habits, he said the locals used to have ghee-mixed tea to keep warm earlier but now that has been replaced by normal tea. Major effect on the cultivation of apples Bisht informed that one of the major effects has been on the cultivation of apples in the area and livelihood of the people in the villages. “Earlier the chilled variety of apples like Golden delicious was cultivated in those areas but it has now stopped because of rise in temperatures due to which those apples could not grow. Similarly, the locals in those villages used to collect medicinal herbs from the jungles and sell for their livelihood. That has been also affected as those herbs are now growing less due to climatic changes,” said Bisht. The areas vacated by the glaciers are now occupied by vegetation which used to grow in lower regions. During the study, the team of researchers examined eight glaciers in the Upper Rishi Ganga catchment in Nanda Devi region. “In 1980, the Upper Rishi Ganga catchment which covers an area of 690 sq km had a glaciated area of about 243 sq km, about 35% of the total area. In 2017, it reduced to 217 sq km, a loss of 26 sq km. Now the total glaciated area is only 26% of the total area,” Bisht said on the receding snowline. Srikrishna Nautiyal, another researcher involved in the study, said, “The study also suggested that the glaciers in the region have responded to deprived precipitation conditions since 1980, overlapping our understanding of glacier retreat due to temperature increase in the context of global warming scenario.” Also Read: Why climate scientists believe natural gas won’t avert environment disaster He informed that it was found that the largest glacier of the region, UND glacier covered an area of 71.42 sq km in 1980 which was reduced to 63.72 sq km in 2017. “Similarly, the smallest one, Changbang which occupied 7.85 sq km in 1989, had shrunk to 5.95 sq km in 2017. It was also found that the north-facing glaciers such as Trishul, DRB and Raunthi lost the minimum percentage area compared to south-facing ones like Changbang and Ramni,” said Nautiyal. “This shows that the slope and aspect play a very important role in glacier change variability,” Nautiyal added. Non-climatic factors also play a role in variable loss of glaciers Nautiyal also informed that the study also suggested that “The dynamic response of glaciers to climate is strongly dependent on glacier size and geometry.”"
" Increased tidal flooding, beach erosion and aging sea barriers are among the climate change concerns threatening a famous coastal destination in Massachusetts, according to a report released Thursday by a leading conservation group in the state. The State of the Coast report by The Trustees focuses on the threat of rising sea levels and powerful storm surges on the state’s North Shore, which is home to the major fishing port of Gloucester as well as Salem, the site of the notorious colonial-era witch trials. The organization, considered the largest private coastal landowner and conservation organization in the state, said it hopes the report helps local officials and property owners identify critically threatened areas, prioritize investments and learn from resiliency and mitigation work already underway in the region. “North Shore communities, leaders, and coastal landowners can no longer postpone climate-facing emergency planning and decision making,” Tom O’Shea, The Trustees’ director of coast and natural resources, said in a statement. “Time is running out to take actions that will protect our coast.” The report said the region has more than 50 miles (80 kilometers) of seawalls and other hard coastal barriers that would cost more than $88 million to repair, but aren’t adequate for the risks posed by climate change. It also estimates more than 600 North Shore buildings could experience daily tidal flooding by 2030, and as many as 3,100 by 2070. The most severe storms could put some $100 billion worth of coastal real estate in Essex County at risk, according to the report, which incorporates publicly available data, independent research and reports from other organizations and agencies. The organization calls for more “sustainable and adaptive approaches” for the challenges ahead, including a “regional land protection strategy” to reduce the impact from coastal development. The report also estimates some 400 acres of the Great Marsh, which is considered New England’s largest salt marsh, could be lost by 2070 without remediation efforts. That could lead to habitat loss for plants and wildlife, weaken shoreline resistance to waves and endanger homes, businesses and roads, the report said. Some of the region’s most popular beaches have seen a dramatic loss in shoreline over the decades as well, according to the organization. Crane Beach in Ipswich, which is owned by the Trustees, has lost the equivalent of 84 football fields of sand since the 1950s because of erosion, the report said. The organization said expanding efforts to restore beaches and sand dunes, which has been done in a number of North Shore communities, is one short term solution. It also said it is working with Ipswich officials to raise the height of the road leading to Crane Beach in order to preserve public access, among other resiliency efforts. Massachusetts Senate Minority Leader Bruce Tarr, a Gloucester Republican, called the report a “comprehensive and thoughtful assessment” backed by “real-world data and scientific analysis.” He said in a statement that it underscores the need for collaborative and proactive solutions. National studies have also highlighted the climate change threats facing the region, which stretches from north of Boston up the Atlantic coast to New Hampshire. Last year, a nationwide study by First Street Foundation singled out Salisbury as the community in Massachusetts where climate change concerns are most impacting property values. The New York-based nonprofit suggested coastal homes in the popular beach community would be worth $200,000 to $300,000 more if not for more frequent tidal flooding and increasingly damaging coastal storms. The Trustees said it plans to release a report annually for the next four years examining a different Massachusetts coastal region in order to highlight the threat and possible solutions to climate change impacts. The report released Thursday covers 13 North Shore communities: Swampscott, Marblehead, Salem, Beverly, Manchester-by-the-Sea, Rockport, Gloucester, Essex, Ipswich, Newbury, Rowley, Newburyport, and Salisbury.

" Angela Merkel and other political leaders must treat climate-related issues as an emergency, activist Greta Thunberg said on Thursday after meeting the German chancellor in Berlin. Thunberg, who along with other activists delivered Merkel a letter with 125,000 signatures calling on leaders to do more to cut emissions, said people should “step put of their comfort zones” and be brave enough to tackle the problem. “We told her we face a climate emergency,” Thunberg said of the meeting with Merkel. “We want leaders to step up and treat this as an emergency,” she said at a press conference. Since her appearance in January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Thunberg -- like many other activists -- has taken a lower profile as the pandemic shifted the focus from climate change to health. The large crowds that gathered for protests across the world last year have given way to online campaigning, which many activists concede is often less effective. Now, they appear eager to regain momentum. “We are stuck in a hamster wheel,” Thunberg said. “Everyone blames one another. Someone needs to break that cycle,” said the 17-year- old activist, whose halting, soft-spoken comments contrasted with some of her earlier, more emphatic presentations. While protesters have had some success in shifting the conversation on climate issues, encouraging regions like Europe to set aside large sums of money for a greener recovery, they are disappointed that governments have yet to make explicit promises such as ending fossil-fuel subsidies. Climate policy under the current EU presidency and the region’s targeted climate neutrality by 2050 were at the center of the meeting at the chancellery, Merkel’s office said in a statement. “Both sides agreed that the warming of the planet is a global challenge that industrial nations have a particular obligation to help overcome,” Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, wrote in the statement. Merkel has brokered a 54 billion-euro ($64 billion) domestic climate package and then a 130 billion-euro economic-recovery package in June that even environmentalists acknowledged was surprisingly green. The chancellor’s steady hand during the pandemic has boosted her approval ratings at the expense of the Green party, which a year ago vied with her Christian Democratic bloc as the No. 1 force in the country. Elections are slated for the autumn of 2021 and Merkel has said she will not run for a fifth term. (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

" The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of diversification and resilience of supply chains as well as the relevance of the concept of strategic autonomy, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Thursday. The pandemic also underscored the need for broader rebalancing and a more equitable world view, which for India means the urgent need to strengthen national capacities through the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India) initiative, he told a roundtable of the ASEAN-India Network of Think Tanks (AINTT). The Covid-19 crisis has shown up the lack of multilateralism at a time when it “was most in demand”, Jaishankar said in his address to the virtual event. “If we saw little leadership, it was not just due to the admittedly anachronistic nature of key international organisations. Equally, it reflected the intensely competitive nature of current international politics,” he said. Going beyond organisations and structures, this was “even more evident in the individual behaviour of many states”. He added, “Therefore, the big issue that confronts the thinking world is not simply the state of the economy, the damage to societies or the challenges to governance. It is actually a debate on the future directions of global affairs and what kind of world order – or disorder – we are going to live in.” As a consequence of all this, “the commodity that is perhaps most valued in international relations today is that of trust”, and national security is being redefined to include economic security while concerns have also arisen about technology security, he said. In an apparent reference to China, he said “the actions of nations during times of crisis determine how the world really perceives them, and they did bring up many of the risks inherent in the current global economy”. He added, “Consequently, concerns about supply chains are sought to be mitigated at the very least through greater emphasis on their diversification and resilience.” The concept of strategic autonomy, which was once fashionable in a unipolar world, has assumed relevance again in terms of global supply chains, Jaishankar noted. The Covid-19 crisis has led to an unprecedented challenge and a great deal of uncertainty and the true extent of its destruction remains unclear. “We cannot pretend that this is just another happening, only bigger. On the contrary, the impact of the Coronavirus has been beyond our collective imagination,” he said. “Current estimates put the cumulative loss in the range of $5.8-8.8 trillion or approximately 6.5-9.7% of the global GDP. The contraction of the world economy being predicted will surely be the largest since the Great Depression,” he added. The relationship between India and Asean was founded on the shared interest in globalisation and the pandemic has brought out the indivisible aspect of human existence that underpins globalisation, Jaishankar said. “Whether it is climate change, terrorism or indeed pandemics, these are not challenges where those affected have a choice. The limitations of purely national responses or sometimes living in denial have become evident,” he said. Jaishankar said Asean and India can together help shape Asia and the world, and need to debate issues such as the Indo-Pacific. “As global relationships alter, we too need to take stock...As we come out of this pandemic, let us be clear on one fact. The world will never be the same again. That means new thinking, fresh ideas, more imagination and greater openness,” he added."
                               
" Natural gas produces half as much carbon dioxide (C02) when burned than coal, but that doesn’t make it harmless. Climate scientists say that rising production of natural gas is emerging as one of the biggest drivers of climate change, and that plans for industry expansion could hobble efforts to stabilize the Earth’s climate. The U.S. energy industry plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars building pipelines and terminals in coming years to ramp up exports of natural gas in supercooled liquefied form, known as LNG. In January 2020, the American Petroleum Institute (API), a powerful lobbying group for the oil and gas industry, launched its “Energy for Progress” advertising campaign. The campaign has described natural gas as a “clean” or “environmentally friendly” energy source that has lowered CO2 emissions in the United States. It also says that increasing global exports of U.S. gas “offers a solution to help lower the world’s carbon footprint.” ALSO READ: Leonardo DiCaprio draws fans’ attention to climate crisis after Trump administration clears way for drilling in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Reuters ran these claims by a dozen scientists and energy experts, and also sought their responses to other questions about the effects of natural gas on climate change. ISN’T NATURAL GAS BETTER FOR THE CLIMATE THAN COAL? Burning natural gas produces about half as much CO2 as coal to produce the same amount of energy. It also produces far fewer pollutants that can harm human health. In the United States, natural gas from the country’s fracking industry has helped drive a dramatic reduction in the use of coal to generate electricity. Overall, U.S. CO2 emissions have fallen 15% from their 2007 peak, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Not all of that reduction can be attributed to natural gas; also contributing were such factors as increased energy efficiency and the growing use of renewables. ISN’T SOME IMPROVEMENT OVER COAL BETTER THAN NOTHING? Yes, but to limit the rise in average global temperatures to 1.5C - the most ambitious goal of the 2015 Paris climate agreement - scientists say emissions must be reduced to net zero by 2050, which leaves far less room for use of fossil fuels of any kind. Emissions globally need to fall by about 7.6% a year between now and 2030 to meet the 1.5C target, according to the U.N. Environment Programme. Last year, U.S. emissions fell by about 2.9%, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency. But emissions from the natural gas industry, particularly in the United States, are now growing so rapidly that the sector “is quickly becoming one of the biggest, if not the biggest, challenges to address climate change,” said Pep Canadell, a senior research scientist at CSIRO Climate Science Centre in Canberra, Australia. In November, a U.N.-backed team of researchers found that the world was on track to produce 70% more natural gas in 2030 than would be compatible with the 1.5C goal. “Most of the new gas production isn’t supplanting coal - it’s supplementing it. It’s answering demand for new energy,” said Rob Jackson, a professor at Stanford University who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks greenhouse gas emissions. WHAT IS THE DANGER OF METHANE IN NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION? Climate scientists are concerned about another greenhouse gas that leaks into the atmosphere during natural gas production: methane. Methane has a warming effect up to 80 or 90 times more powerful than C02 over a 20-year timescale. In April, a study published in the journal Science Advances found that the amount of methane being released in the natural gas and oil-rich Permian basin between New Mexico and Texas was double federal estimates. Two further studies, published in July, highlighted the role of the U.S. oil and gas industry in driving a rise in global methane emissions to the highest levels on record.           "
" Clearing the way for drilling in the remote Alaskan area, Trump administrations’ oil and gas leasing program in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has left many shook and concerned about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Hollywood star and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio drew fans’ attention to Interior Secretary David Bernhardt’s announcement on Monday regarding the same. Taking to his social media handles, DiCaprio shared a CNN report briefing about the availability of the entire 1.5 million acre Coastal Plain area after the future leases of the federally-owned land. Though the plans are certain to be met with legal challenges, since drilling in the Alaskan Arctic has long been controversial, Bernhardt asserted that the announcement “marks a new chapter in American energy independence” and hoped it could “create thousands of new jobs.” However, environmental activists have predicted exacerbated climate crisis and damaging of the environment as the only result of drilling the Arctic. Yet, ahead of the elections in US this year, President Donald Trump has already signed offshore drilling executive order. Current president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council, Gina McCarthy, who was also an Environmental Protection Agency administrator under former President Barack Obama, not only considered the decision a threat to US wildlife but also called it an “egregious intrusion into the sacred lands of the Gwich’in and other Indigenous People”. DiCaprio shared an image of the melting Arctic and captioned it with an excerpt from the report.   @cnnclimate: Interior Secretary David Bernhardt on Monday announced plans for an oil and gas leasing program in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, clearing the way for drilling in the remote Alaskan area. Bernhardt said future leases of the federally-owned land will make the entire 1.5 million acre Coastal Plain area available. Environmental activists have sounded the alarm that drilling the Arctic could harm the environment and exacerbate the climate crisis. Climate change has been a key issue in the upcoming 2020 election, and Joe Biden, who is set to accept the Democratic presidential nomination this week, has called for a ban on new oil and gas permits on public lands.

(📸: Bill Weir/CNN) A post shared by Leonardo DiCaprio (@leonardodicaprio) on Aug 17, 2020 at 10:41am PDT On a call with reporters, Bernhardt shared, “I do believe that there could be a lease sale by the end of the year. It requires an oil and gas development program that delivers energy to the nation and revenue to the Treasury. The law makes oil and gas development one of the purposes of the refuge, clearly directing me, acting through the Bureau of Land Management, to carry out a competitive exploration and development program for the potentially energy rich coastal plain.”"
" Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday urged citizens to be cautious about tropical and vector-borne diseases and asked them to take steps to be safe amid the country’s battle against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). “This is the season of tropical and vector-borne diseases. I urge you all to take the right precautions. The Government is also closely monitoring the situation and ensuring care to those affected. Stay safe, be happy!” PM Modi tweeted. PM Modi’s tweet comes at a time when India is likely to face challenges during the dengue season, prompting state governments to prepare protocols and find ways to ease the burden on country’s healthcare infrastructure. Tropical and vector-borne diseases are caused by blood-sucking anthropoid like mosquitoes. The most commonly reported infectious tropical and vector-borne diseases in India include dengue, malaria and chikungunya. Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that spreads dengue, is most prevalent in cities, and experts have warned in the past that increased urbanisation and warming temperatures due to climate change means that its range will keep increasing."
" As many as 10 million people across California may take turns being plunged into darkness on Monday evening as the state’s grid operator works to keep the region’s power system from collapsing under the strain of one of the worst heat waves in generations. The outages, which were expected to hit as soon as 4 p.m. in California, would mark the third time in four days that the state’s utilities deliberately cut power to protect a grid that’s been pushed to the brink of failure as people blast their air conditioners and fans to keep cool. The state is facing an electricity shortfall on Monday of about 4.4 gigawatts, according to California Governor Gavin Newsom. That’s the equivalent of about four nuclear power plants. “Let me just make this crystal clear: We failed to predict and plan these shortages -- and that’s simply unacceptable,” said Newsom, who called for an investigation into why officials failed to anticipate the need for blackouts. Shortly after 3:30 p.m, the state’s grid operator declare a stage-two grid emergency -- one step away from a blackout order. Since Friday, millions of Californians have been abruptly plunged into darkness with little notice, reminiscent of the mass blackouts that the state’s utilities carried out less than a year ago to keep their electrical lines from sparking fires during unusually strong windstorms -- all extreme weather events made more frequent by climate change. But even last year’s outages pale in comparison to the one planned for Monday. Rarely if ever have 3.3 million homes and businesses across California, or roughly 10 million people based on the average size of a household, been affected by a planned shutdown of this kind. And it couldn’t be hitting California at a more vulnerable time, with the pandemic forcing people into lockdown, leaving them with little choice but to endure the heat indoors. The rotating blackouts will last for about an hour each, according to the state’s grid operator. This month is the first time California has resorted to rotating outages since the 2001 energy crisis, when hundreds of thousands of customers lost power, electricity prices surged to record levels and the state’s largest electric utility went bankrupt. (It went bankrupt a second time last year in the face of crippling wildfire liabilities.) Part of the problem is California’s rapid shift away from natural gas. About 9 gigawatts of gas generation, enough to power 6.8 million homes, have been retired over the past five years as the state turns increasingly to renewables, according to BloombergNEF. That leaves fewer options when the sun sets and solar production wanes. Normally, California can import enough power from neighboring states when supplies are tight. But the sprawling heat wave blanketing the U.S. West is pushing power plants to the hilt across the region. “California is in a tight spot,” BNEF analyst Brian Bartholomew said. “It’s retired a lot of gas. And the storage that’s supposed to help hasn’t yet come online.” Tonight could be the grid’s biggest test yet, with temperatures expected to soar as high as 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 Celsius) in some parts of the state. Heat in some parts of the region has already broken records. “We don’t have enough resources,” John Phipps, director of real time operations at the California Independent System Operator, said on a conference call. “We’re going to have to” call for blackouts. Newsom, a Democrat, signed an order that will temporarily allow users and utilities to use backup generators to ease the need for blackouts. By 3 p.m. local time, it was already 102 degrees in Sacramento. With temperatures climbing, demand for power in the state is expected to reach more than 49,700 megawatts Monday afternoon, just shy of the all-time record set in 2006. Power prices more than doubled, to the highest in five months. The relentless heat is starting to take a physical toll on California’s power system. Transformers -- the metal cylinders sitting atop power poles -- can malfunction and catch fire if they don’t cool off at night. And temperatures in some parts of Southern California are expected to remain in the low 80’s overnight. During a deadly, 10-day heatwave in 2006, the state’s utilities lost more than 1,500 of these devices, with each knocking out service to one neighborhood in the process. The heat wave gripping the West Coast stems from a stubborn, high-pressure system that has parked itself across the Great Basin spanning Nevada and other western states. It essentially acts as a lid trapping hot air, and there aren’t any indications it’s going to budge soon. Such phenomenons, sometimes called heat domes, are getting worse because the Earth’s climate is changing. As the planet warms, the contrast between the heat at the equator and the cold at the pole decreases. That saps the strength of the jet stream, which otherwise would be able to shove the ridges out of the way. It explains in part why extreme heat has blanketed regions around the world in recent weeks. Extreme weather has taken a profound toll on electrical grids in recent weeks. Earlier this month, millions of people lost power across the US Midwest after a wall of lightning, hail and deadly winds tore a path of ruin from central Iowa to Chicago. Days earlier, Tropical Storm Isaias darkened millions of homes from the Carolinas to Connecticut."
    
                                              
                  
" It’s hot out. Cue the headlines showing yet another temperature record above the Arctic circle, fires deep in the Amazon, and more intense floods and droughts anywhere in between. Also look for the self-described rational skeptics, the eco-pragmatists, and other hyphenated attention-seekers pointing out how, yes, it’s summer in the northern hemisphere, how it’s been hot in the past, and how we need to look at hardnosed statistics rather than headlines and emotions. Let’s. Yes, there have been Biblical floods and droughts long before humanity began burning fossil fuels. It’s also true, of course, that modern societies are better prepared to weather these extreme events, and that some observed impacts are due to more people and their wealth having moved in harm’s way (sadly often supported by misguided government policies). But it’s precisely a closer look at statistics that tells us why even relatively small changes in global average temperatures are such a big deal. Climate is weather. Not literally, of course. Climate is the long-term batting average, while weather is what happens in any one baseball game. Climate is your personality, weather is your mood today. Climate, in short, is weather averaged. This chart from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shows how the two are intimately linked. We see so many record hot temperatures precisely because global average temperatures have increased by over 1°C by now. Those relatively small increases in mean temperatures don’t just make hot weather a bit more likely. They increase the chance of hot weather extremes by a lot. Add more temperature variability to the mix, and the chance of extremes goes higher still. Heat kills. Whether the temperature outside is 21°C or 22°C (around 70°F or 72°F) makes little difference. The latter might even register as a bit more pleasant. Increase it to 32°C (around 90°F), however, and all sorts of bad things begin to happen. If you’re a New York City high school student taking the Regents exam, you’re suddenly over 10% more likely to fail. Hotter temperatures make workers and, with it, entire economies less productive. They kill crops. They kill animals. They kill people, especially the poor. One additional day above 32°C increases the chance of dying that year by 0.11%. And that’s in the United States. Indians are 5 to 10 times more likely to die because of extreme heat, driven by rural India. Relatively richer urban Indians have the same mortality rate from extreme heat as the average American, pointing to the impact of extreme poverty. The rich adapt. The poor suffer. If climate change is your personality and weather your mood, climate change is making all of us moodier. That goes for increased road rage and car crashes on hot days as much as for increased police aggression, robberies, domestic violence, assaults, and murders. And heat on the baseball field leads to more pitchers hitting batters with errant balls as retaliation. These individual effects extend to increased peasant rebellions in Qing China, political instability in Medieval Egypt, ethnic riots in India, communal conflict in sub-Saharan Africa, and civil conflicts and political coups globally. The link between climate and conflict is strong, and unmitigated climate change all but ensures that it’s getting stronger. A few more sultry nights may well sound pleasant after hiding in (Covid-19-transmission-proof) air-conditioning all day. But those small increases in global averages go hand in hand with large increases in extremes. These extremes are not just unpleasant. They are all too often deadly."
                              
" A day after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi described the draft environment impact assessment (EIA) as a “disaster” and urged people to protest against it, Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said on Monday that those raising objections to the draft (EIA notification are the same people who took “big decisions without consultations” when they were in power. “Saw reaction of some leaders demanding protest against the EIA draft. How can they protest against the draft? It is not a final notification. It was kept for public consultation for 150 days because of Covid-19. Otherwise it is only 60 days as per rules,” PTI quoted him as saying after an event to celebrate World Elephant Day. Javadekar said the environment ministry has received thousands of suggestions which it will consider before coming out with the final draft. “We have received thousands of suggestions which we welcome. We will consider those suggestions. Then take a call and come out with the final draft. So people jumping just on the draft is not fair practice. Those who want to now protest, took many of the big decisions without consultations during their regime. It is unnecessary and premature. I have mentioned it in my letter to (Congress leader and former Union minister) Jairam Ramesh,” he said. “It (Gandhi’s comment on EIA and demanding protests) is unnecessary and premature,” Javadekar said. On Sunday, Gandhi had tweeted, “This EIA 2020 draft is a disaster. It seeks to silence the voice of communities who will be directly impacted by the environmental degradation it unleashes. I urge every Indian to rise up and protest against it.” The Congress leader has also called for its withdrawal, saying it will lead to further environmental destruction and looting. “EIA 2020 draft must be withdrawn to stop the loot of the nation and environmental destruction,” Gandhi said. Congress MP Jairam Ramesh who heads the Parliamentary standing committee on science and technology, environment, forests and climate change, technology has been one of the strongest critics of the draft EIA. On Monday, ahead of Javadekar’s comments, he said the draft EIA loosens pollution standards for thermal power plants, dilutes coastal regulation zone and opens up the western ghats in a substantial manner in an eco-sensitive area among other things He accused the government of adopting double standards on environmental issues. “Globally, you want to assume the role of being an environmental leader but domestically, what you are doing is diluting all the laws that we have,” Ramesh said."
" The ammonium nitrate explosion tragedy in Beirut was avoidable. It also has lessons for India. Chemicals are complex creatures. Ammonium nitrate, for example, is used for fertilisers, although it is being phased out in some countries. But, as we saw, it is almost bomb-like in its propensity to explode. In India, chemicals are handled both formally and informally, even the most toxic of them. For example, people come in contact with mercury and pesticides. So, although we don’t know of an ammonium nitrate crisis in the public domain, let’s try to avoid one. At the risk of stating what many people know already, here are a few foundational steps. First, ministries concerned, with a lead from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, should identify the most explosive chemicals still in use. Second, a handling protocol should be prepared based on the field observations of current practices. Some of these can restrict how much to store, how to store, and how long to store. We know that over time, chemicals lying in godowns can be forgotten till they kill. Third, the protocol has to be disseminated innovatively, both at the grassroot level and the local administration. Capacity building is essential — how should people measure, handle and monitor? What should a trader in a chemical bazaar know, for example? And of course, registry systems should be strengthened, and made easier to use. These are just the basics. We need to roll them, and many more, out before we are struck by a chemical catastrophe.

" Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh may witness a temperature increase of up to 6.9 degrees Celsius by the end of the century due to climate change, according to a study which warns that the glaciers in this Himalayan region could shrink by 85 per cent if the projections come true. The study, published in the journal Climatic Change on July 29, predicted the impact of future climate change in the Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh Himalaya, by the end of the twenty-first century using an ensemble of 11 models under three greenhouse gas emission scenarios. It also highlights the changes in the distribution of the prevalent climate zones in the region. “The study has been carried over the entire region of Jammu and Kashmir, including Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Aksai Chin and other regions across the Line of Control (LoC),” noted Professor Shakil Ahmad Romshoo, Dean of Research at the University of Kashmir. “The average annual temperature is projected to increase by 4.5 degrees Celsius, 3.98 degrees Celsius, and 6.93 degrees Celsius by the end of the twenty first century under three different scenarios, respectively,” Romshoo, lead author of the research, told PTI. The temperature increase of 6.9 degrees Celsius for the Jammu and Kashmir Himalayas is way more than the projected average rise in the global and national temperatures by the end of the century. Romshoo added that if the current emission rates of greenhouse gases are sustained, the global average temperature is likely to rise by nearly 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the twenty-first century under the worst case scenario. Similarly, the average temperature over India is projected to rise by approximately 4.4 degrees Celsius under such a scenario, he said. Romshoo noted that there will be significant impacts on almost every sector of the economy in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh due to this climate change driven temperature increase. “The glaciers, the most important resource of the region, are going to shrink by around 85 per cent by the end of the century if the projections come true,” the professor at the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Kashmir, noted. He explained that this would lead to significant depletion of the streamflows in the Indus basin, the waters of which are shared between several countries in South Asia. Similarly, the impacts on agriculture, horticulture and even tourism shall significantly threaten the livelihood of the dependent population in the region, the environmentalist warned. The researchers, including Jasia Bashir and Irfan Rashid from the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Kashmir, noted that the drivers of climate change are primarily the increasing emission rates of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gas emission is directly related to fossil fuel use, industrialisation, deforestation, air pollution, and other environmental unfriendly activities across the globe, they explained. “Though, the mountainous regions like Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh are the least industrialised, unfortunately, they are bearing the brunt of the climate change as the phenomena has global dimensions and footprint,” Romshoo noted. The projected climate change under the three emission scenarios also indicates significant changes in the distribution of prevalent climate zones. The projected climate change under different scenarios revealed that the subtropical and temperate climatic zones would expand while the cold desert climate zone is projected to shrink significantly under all the three scenarios, the researchers noted. “The cold desert climate zone in the Ladakh region would shrink by 22 per cent and correspondingly the subtropical and temperate zones would expand due to the projected climate change,” the researchers noted in their study. “The projected changes in the climate and climate zones by the end of the twenty-first century would have significant impacts on various sectors in the region which might lead to the redistribution and changes in the composition of vegetation, enhancement of snow depletion and glacier recession,” said Romshoo. He noted that the situation would also lead to an increase in the frequency of climate extremes, changes in streamflows, in the faunal and floral biodiversity, plant invasions, changes in agriculture and horticulture productivity. This is in addition to the loss of hydropower generation, ecosystem services, and impacts on other key economic sectors in the region, according to the researchers."
" Of all the trends that we see come and go in the modern age, Greenism is one that has been a long time coming. Not enough can be said about the need for preserving the environment, especially at this point in the history of the Earth. We have an ongoing pandemic, natural disasters that are wrecking homes and lives, the extinction of many animals and the constant drain on the ecosystem. We are no longer talking about Greenism as just an ideology or belief. What started out as an idea in the 1970’s, has now become a full-blown movement and to an extent a political ideology. Greenism is synonymous with Environmentalism, if perhaps a tad more aggressive in its approach. The Green Revolution takes into account the drastic measures that need to be employed in order to preserve the environment. It highlights the fundamental causes that result in the steady decline that we are currently seeing in our delicate ecosystem. It also provides facts for issues such as global warming and climate change, which many people are quick to disregard. ALSO READ: World Nature Conservation Day 2020: History, Significance, How to live sustainably The simple goal of Greenism is to raise awareness about the importance of environmental conservation. It sheds light on how the environment is directly linked to human health and the only way in which the environment can be restored is through the application of science and conscious, sustainable, natural practices. We see the translation of this in all industries, as more and more people realise the importance of sustainable practices in their everyday production and consumption. Despite it’s many drawbacks, certain members of the global fashion industry are trying to move away from all the years of activities that harmed the environment, and are moving towards more sustainable, environment friendly practices. Some brands make it a point to return what they took from the environment by planting trees for every certain number of products sold, etc. Some brands also make only use those methods of production that have a minimal impact on the environment. ALSO READ: Sustainable fashion: Understanding sustainability in fashion and how to make conscious wardrobe choices To an extent, Greenism places the blame on capitalism and heady consumerism for the current condition of the environment and it means to take proper measures in order to help eradicate these effects through increasing awareness for the conservation of nature. There has been debate about the true nature of Greenism as many point out that it Greenism, under the guise of being environmentally motivated, exploits its very resources and feeds off capitalism. It is also important to note that this questioning of Greenism motives has been in the works for a long time, on the surface it appears to work towards the betterment of the environment but has inadvertently caused more harm in its wake. There has been a lot of backlash against the Greenism movement and against used methods to achieve its purpose. Jigs Gardner, in an article labelled ‘Understanding Greenism’, talks about how Greenism is the furthest from environmentalism in practice saying that, “Environmentalism is an evolutionary process seeking appropriate solutions to tangible problems. Greenism exploits such problems to prevent their rational solution.” He also mentions that when a municipality faces a disposal problem, the ‘Greens’ hinder possible solutions by endless hearings, meetings, petitions and litigations. This is especially true in the case of high-tech matter. To an extent, it has become the very corporation it is supposed to regulate, as “Greens devote much of their energy to the creation of false problems, non-existent crises which can be solved only by draconian, astronomically expensive means.”"
" Frequent tectonic activities combined with changing weather patterns due to global warming are causing natural calamities including landslides in the Himalayan region especially Pithoragarh which has been the worst affected district in Uttarakhand this year, say experts. At least 21 people have died in the hill district of Pithoragarh since April due to various natural tragedies including landslides caused by heavy rains. Over 60 villages in its Munsiyari area were cut off due to heavy rains last month. Pradeep Kumar assistant geologist, Pithoragarh district said, “The reason behind the natural tragedies in Pithoragarh seems to be a combination of tectonic activities beneath the ground and incessant rains in the higher reaches due to changing weather patterns.” Kumar had conducted a geological survey of the villages that were hit hard by heavy rain in the last one month. He added, “The areas of Dharchula, Bangapani and Munsiyari which houses most of the affected villages come under earthquake-prone areas in the Himalayas. These areas suffer small earthquakes round the year because of which the soil becomes loose. And when heavy rains lash these areas, landslides happen leading to severe damage to property and life.” Scientists at GB Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment (NIHE) in Almora corroborated Kumar’s contention and said the changing weather pattern has also contributed to the number of natural disasters happening in Pithoragarh. “The increase in global surface temperature has increased the frequency of cloudbursts and incessant rains in the area. Unfortunately, this seems set to increase in the near future,” Dr RS Rawal, director of GB Pant NIHE."
" Experts from Flinders University, Australia say that in the midst of a global pandemic, eating well in a sustainable way is more important now than ever. ‘Eating local’ and growing your own fruit and vegetables can save money, provide families and local producers with vital income -- and also improve health and immunity. “The COVID-19 pandemic provides many good reasons to eat in healthier and more sustainable ways,” says Flinders University researcher Associate Professor Kaye Mehta. “Gardening or being part of a community gardening or local food swap group lifts social connection, reduces anxiety and stress and improves mental health by nurturing plants out in the fresh air.” ALSO READ: Pledge to healthy eating, sustainable living and zero hunger In a new study, the researchers warn the Australian diet is not sustainable, with high rates of eating meat, excessive packaging and food waste and unhealthy consumption levels. But how much time do people spend weighing up food decisions for their nutritional content, environmental sustainability and fairness, ask Flinders University nutrition and public health experts in a new paper in the Health Promotion Journal of Australia. “At the supermarket and when you eat out, do you investigate where the food comes from? In an ideal world, the food supply would not only be healthy but also be environmentally and socially sustainable,” Associate Professor Mehta says.            "
" The environmental and health impact in the ongoing oil and gas spill due to a blowout in Upper Assam’s Baghjan gasfield will be a long-drawn affair, according to the Wildlife Institute of India’s (WII) 178-page report submitted recently to the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC). WII has said that the highest concentration of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a toxic compound, in fish samples from Maguri Motapung wetland, which is located near the blowout site, was found to be 10-to 100-fold higher than any concentrations reported from India or other parts of the world. “The impact is significant and will have long-term effects, as many of these pollutants will leach into the ground and contaminate groundwater. Long term restorative efforts are needed for cleaning up these pollutants,” the report has said. The burnt-out area is mapped as 65-70 hectares, which include crop fields, grasslands, and swamps. There was a visible oil spill -- oil and sediment -- on June 16 in the downstream of the well, it has said. The Gangetic Dolphin encounters, which were earlier found abundantly in the Brahmaputra tributaries such as Lohit and Dibru and also in Maguri Motapung wetland, have decreased significantly after the blowout. A dolphin was found dead from poisoning from the oil spill. Perhaps, due to the oil spill and intense noise from the blowout, bird species richness has seen an overwhelming decline in grasslands and wetland by 59% and 85%, respectively, the report has said. Fish species have also declined in wetland and river tributaries, where dissolved oxygen level has fallen due to the oil spill. The loud noise due to the explosion can be heard in a radius of 12 kilometres and beyond, making the surroundings extremely unhealthy for humans, animals, and birds. The report has underlined that the wetland and surrounding lowland forests are unique and as a result, extremely vulnerable to more oil spill disasters. The Brahmaputra and the Gangetic floodplain landscape is unique in its morphology and fragility, and is responsible for shaping the unique community of plants and animals … the landscape (in Baghjan) is fragile and is engineered by flooding. The dynamic nature of wetland creates mosaics of habitat which is in perpetual flux. In India as well as the world over, there are only a handful of Protected Areas (PAs), where this unique biodiversity is surviving, and among them, Dibru-Saikhowa National Park (DSNP) and Kaziranga Orang National Park top the list, the report has stated and added that oil wells in and around DSNP would be detrimental to the unique ecosystem. The landscape is also extremely vulnerable to earthquakes and occasionally massive tremors. The expert appraisal committee of the MoEFCC in meetings held between 30 and January 1 had recommended environmental clearance for drilling and testing of hydrocarbons at seven locations inside and under the DSNP. “’The potential of oil blowout and oil spill-like disaster is a reality. Such oil wells in the vicinity of DSNP and important bird area complex (DSNP, Bherjan Wildlife Sanctuary, Padumani Wildlife Sanctuary, and Borajan Wildlife Sanctuary, Important Bird Areas (IBA) Poba Reserve Forest, Kobo chapori, Amarpur chapori and Maguri and Motapung, Dihing-Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary) will be detrimental to the conservation value of this unique ecosystem,” the report has said while suggesting that the cumulative impact of existing gas wells would need to be assessed. The study, led by WII scientist Qamar Qureshi, has also recommended that the government initiates a long term study to monitor the long-term impact on the ecology of Maguri-Motapung wetland and DSNP as well as on the health and socio-economic conditions of local communities around the affected areas. Since the restoration of the area will be a long-term process, an appropriate committee should be formed to monitor and guide the process. “WII has submitted its voluminous report. We are trying to get more details and may go back to WII for it. We are sending all the findings to the Assam government to begin mitigation and restoration work. I understand that the situation is still grim there,” said Soumitra Dasgupta, additional director general (wildlife), MoEFCC. “We will need time to respond to WII’s findings. Since it is a technical report, we will also have to get it reviewed by our independent experts. Our focus is presently on controlling the well and resolving the blowout,” said Tridiv Hazarika, spokesperson, Oil India Limited (OIL)."
" Two adult tigers were photographed in Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang Valley Wildlife Sanctuary in 2018 during the tiger estimation survey by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), according to the 656-page “Status of Tigers, Co-predators and Prey in India” report that was released on Tuesday. The Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has brought out the 2018 report. Dibang Valley holds unique importance for in-situ conservation of this “unique and genetically diverse lineage of tigers” as the local aboriginal community, Idu Mishmis, a sub-tribe of Mishmi and of Mongoloid origin, who speaks the Tibeto-Burman language, considers tiger as the ethnic group’s elder brother, the NTCA has said in its report. In the Dibang-Kamlang-Namdapha block, the report has estimated the presence of 29 tigers based on scat samples and camera-trap images. The confirmation of the presence of tigers in Dibang Valley holds immense importance to the Idu Mishmis because large forest areas around the Dibang Valley Wildlife Sanctuary are being considered for diversion. The proposed 3,097 mega-watt Etalin Hydropower Project is likely to impact 1150.08 hectares (ha) of forestland and the Dibang Multipurpose Dam will impact 4,577.84 ha of un-classified state forest and other community lands. Both the projects are under different stages of consideration by the MoEFCC. In 2014, an adult tiger was photographed in the Dibang Valley during the estimation process. Molecular signs were also noted. “Tiger presence is repeatedly being seen during camera-trap exercises. The Dibang Valley is an ideal natural habitat for tigers,” said SP Yadav, member-secretary, NTCA. The 2018 estimation has recommended that discussions be conducted with the Idu Mishmis before proceeding with any legal notification of the sanctuary to be a tiger reserve. During a three-year-long camera trap-based study in the Dibang Valley Sanctuary and the adjoining Mishmi hills, 11 tigers, including two cubs, were identified by a team of researchers from the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), who had published their results in the Journal of Threatened Taxa in 2018. But, WII in a report titled, “Wildlife Conservation Plan for the Impact Zone of Etalin HEP”, said there was no tiger presence in the project area. “These projects will impact both the tiger and its prey. Some of the prey cross the Talon river or they are found in abundance along the river like the Mishmi Takin. If the MoEFCC authorities consider the tiger to be an important species, then they will not consider projects that will be disastrous for the animal’s habitat. The community had always known about tigers’ presence in their homeland,” said Anoko Mega, member, State Wildlife Advisory Board, Arunachal Pradesh. “If at all a tiger reserve is declared in the area, the boundary should be demarcated after consulting the local indigenous population in a bid to ensure that there is no impact on human habitation,” he added. The Idu Mishmi community members consider tigers as their kin with whom they have been co-existing through the generations. The Idu Mishmi Cultural & Literary Society (IMCLS), an apex community body, had written to NTCA and MoEFCC authorities in 2018, stating that the community would like to be consulted before proceeding with notifying the Dibang Valley Sanctuary to be a tiger reserve. “Based on years of empirical research on ecological and social aspects of tigers in Dibang Valley, we strongly believe that the right strategy to develop a new kind of tiger reserve that is built not with fences and armed patrol guards, but around a cultural model. It is a culture, which has so far proven to be effective in saving the tiger,” IMCLS had written. The 2018 NTCA report has cited that Arunachal Pradesh has large contiguous forests over 136,000 kilometres (km), including Pakke Tiger Reserves in the west; Tale Valley Wildlife Sanctuary, Mouling National Park, D’Ering Wildlife Sanctuary, Mehao Wildlife Sanctuary in the centre; Dibang Wildlife Sanctuary in the north, and Kamlang and Namdapha Tiger Reserve in the east. “Compared to earlier surveys this landscape unit shows a persisting low-density tiger population … the largest tiger population of Arunachal Pradesh is within pockets of this landscape,” it has said."
" Russian scientists are poring over the stunningly well-preserved bones of an adult woolly mammoth that roamed the earth at least 10,000 years ago, after local inhabitants discovered its remains in the shallows of a north Siberian lake. Part of its skull, several ribs and foreleg bones, some with soft tissue still attached to them, were retrieved from Russia’s remote Yamal peninsula above the Arctic circle on July 23. Scientists are still searching the site for other bones. Similar finds in Russia’s vast Siberian region have happened with increasing regularity as climate change warming the Arctic at a faster pace than the rest of the world has thawed the ground in some areas long locked in permafrost. Scientists circulated images in December of a prehistoric puppy, thought to be 18,000 years old, that was found in the permafrost region of Russia’s Far East in 2018. The mammoth remains are at least 10,000 years old, although researchers don’t yet know exactly when it walked the earth or how old it was when it died, said Dmitry Frolov, director of the Scientific Centre for Arctic studies. Researchers have found mammoth fossils dating from up to 30,000 years ago in Russia, he said. Yevgeniya Khozyainova, a scientist from a local museum, said it was unusual to find so many bones belonging to a single species and to know where they came from. “Of course, we’d like to find the remaining parts, to understand how complete a find it is. Whenever there is soft tissue left behind, it is valuable material to study,” she said. (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

" On Monday, former environment minister and senior Congress leader, Jairam Ramesh, reiterated that the draft Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), 2020 notification was not based on research, reduced public participation, and represented an attitude which viewed environmental regulation as an “unnecessary...burden”, not as a means to ensure the welfare of people and sustainable development. Union minister of environment, forest and climate change, Prakash Javadekar, termed Mr Ramesh’s comments “unfounded”. But Mr Ramesh is not the only one with concerns. On July 10, 100 environmental researchers, activists, ecologists, conservationists, and former members of government bodies sent a letter to Mr Javadekar, critiquing the notification. The critics claim that the draft EIA legitimises post-facto environment clearance; excludes major industries from the EIA process; subverts the public hearing process; reduces the scope of citizens to report violations, and fails to address a project’s impact on wildlife, and habitats. This is mostly true. They also claim the draft fails to address the conflict of interest that arises from the fact that a project proponent can choose a consultant to do impact assessment; and the quality of composition of the expert appraisal committee, which is often staffed by those with no technical expertise. These, too, are valid objections."
" The draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) notification, 2020, threatens to be the next flashpoint in Assam after the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, with several prominent groups and parties opposing it by terming it anti-north-east. Issued on March 12 by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), if implemented, EIA, 2020, will be applicable across the country and subsume EIA, 2006, with regards to setting up projects or expansion/modernisation of existing projects entailing capacity addition. The guidelines of EIA are used to study and predict the effect of a proposed activity/project on the environment. It is used as a tool to compare various alternatives for a project and tries to identify the one that represents the best combination of economic and environmental costs and benefits. The draft EIA notification, 2020, states that it aims to make the process of prior environment clearance “more transparent and expedient through the implementation of an online system, further delegations, rationalisation, standardisation of the process, etc”. But since the new draft reduces the period set aside for public consultation and allows post-facto clearance of projects, many groups, and parties are sceptical that it is aimed at hurting interests of Assam and the north-east and would harm the region’s fragile ecosystem. “This proposed law is objectionable primarily because it paves the way for post-facto clearance of projects in eco-sensitive zones and sidesteps inputs by communities likely to be adversely affected by such projects,” said Congress legislator and leader of opposition in Assam assembly Debabrata Saikia in a letter to Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar on July 23. “Private companies concerned can even prepare their own EIA reports by engaging private consultants. This is a travesty of natural justice and a body blow to the rights of indigenous people over their land,” he added seeking scrapping of the draft EIA notification, 2020, in its present form. Saikia cited EIA, 2020 as “extremely dangerous” for Assam and the north-east in view of the damage, which has already been caused by mining/drilling operations underway or sanctioned in national parks and wildlife sanctuaries in the region. “The EIA draft, 2020, legitimises the systemic repression perpetrated by the Central government. It is violative, exploitative, suppresses public involvement, and cripples biodiversity. Its inclusions are unjust, anti-democratic and anti-environment for Assam and the north-east at large,” Samujjal Bhattacharjya, chief adviser of All Assam Students Union (AASU), had tweeted on July 25. The opposition to EIA, 2020, has some recent context in Assam. On April 17, the National Board of Wild Life (NBWL) under the MoEFCC had allowed opencast coal mining at Dehing Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary, a move that caused an uproar in Assam. In May, the MoEFCC gave environmental clearance for extension drilling and testing of hydrocarbons at seven locations by Oil India Limited (OIL) under Dibru-Saikhowa National Park (DSNP) area in Upper Assam’s Tinsukia district. On May 27, a natural gas well of OIL located at Baghjan, adjacent to DSNP, had a blowout and then caught fire on June 9 killing two firefighters and displacing around 2,000 families besides causing ecological damage to the surrounding area. The gas well blaze is yet to be extinguished. “The Central government’s intention is to loot the land and resources of Assam and the rest of the north-east. Hence they brought out this draft EIA notification, 2020, which is detrimental to our interests,” Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti leader Manas Konwar had alleged at a press meet in Guwahati on July 25. “The draft EIA notification, 2020, allows the Centre to set up industry within a 100-kilometre (km) aerial distance from any international boundary without a public hearing. Since almost all states of the north-east, including Assam, are connected to international borders, this draft is directly against the interests of the people from the north-east,” said Partha Protim Bezbaruah, general secretary, Liberal Democratic Party, a regional outfit. The MoEFCC had published the draft EIA notification, 2020, on March 12 seeking feedback from the public within 60 days."
" A climate activist from India has been named by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to his new advisory group comprising young leaders who will provide perspectives and solutions to tackle the worsening climate crisis, as the global body mobilizes action as part of the Covid-19 recovery efforts. Archana Soreng joins six other young climate leaders from around the world who have been named by Guterres to his new Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change. Soreng is “experienced in advocacy and research, and she is working to document, preserve, and promote traditional knowledge and cultural practices of indigenous communities,” the UN said in a statement on Monday. “Our ancestors have been protecting the forest and nature over the ages through their traditional knowledge and practices. Now it is on us to be the front runners in combating the climate crisis,” said Soreng, who has studied regulatory governance from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) Mumbai and is the former TISS Students Union President. The young activists, aged between 18 and 28 years, will advise the UN chief regularly on accelerating global action and ambition to tackle the worsening climate crisis. The announcement marks a new effort by the United Nations to bring more young leaders into decision-making and planning processes, as the UN works to mobilize climate action as part of the Covid-19 recovery efforts. “We are in a climate emergency. We do not have the luxury of time,” Guterres said in a video announcing the establishment of the advisory group. “We need urgent action now – to recover better from COVID-19, to confront injustice and inequality and address climate disruption,” he said. Guterres said young people are on the front lines of climate action, showing nations and leaders what bold leadership looks like. “That is why I am launching my Youth Advisory Group on climate change today – to provide perspectives, ideas and solutions that will help us scale up climate action,” the UN chief said. The members of the Secretary-General’s Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change represent the diverse voices of young people from all regions as well as small island states. They will offer perspectives and solutions on climate change, from science to community mobilization, from entrepreneurship to politics, and from industry to conservation, the UN said. The initial seven members of the group have been chosen to give frank and fearless advice to the Secretary-General, at a time of growing urgency to hold government and corporate leaders to account on climate action. The other selected members of the group are climate activist Nisreen Elsaim of Sudan, Fiji’s Ernest Gibson, the co-coordinator for 350 Fiji, a regional youth-led climate change network, young economist Vladislav Kaim of Moldova who is committed to ensuring green and decent jobs for youth. Sophia Kianni of the United States who has helped organise nationwide strikes and is the founder of international nonprofit Climate Cardinals, founder and coordinator of Generation Climate Europe and spokesperson for Youth and Environment Europe, Nathan Metenier of France and lawyer and human rights defender Paloma Costa of Brazil. The establishment of the group builds on last year’s successful Youth Climate Summit – the first time a Secretary-General has convened a summit for young people entirely devoted to climate action."
" More than 100 high-profile parents from tech entrepreneur Martha Lane-Fox to fashion designer Vivienne Westwood urged Britain’s government on Sunday to ensure economic recovery from the pandemic tackles climate change and puts children at its centre. The 115 business leaders, musicians, scientists, actors and campaigners used an open letter to urge Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson not to “build our way out of one disaster by super-charging the next”. Actress Julie Walters, who was among the signatories, said governments should ramp up their efforts to tackle climate change, in the same way they have responded to protect people from Covid-19. “For the sake of our children, we need governments to put the same energy and investment into preventing an even greater climate catastrophe from unfolding across the globe,” she said. If planet-warming emissions rebound to pre-pandemic levels, it would have “catastrophic consequences for children’s lives and livelihoods”, the letter warned, with those from the poorest and most disadvantaged communities being hit hardest. Spending on green measures - like boosting renewable energy, insulating homes, installing electric vehicle charging points and re-establishing woodlands - would create more and better jobs than rebuilding a fossil-fuel economy, it said. Young people have been most likely to lose their jobs or see their income drop during the virus lockdown, it noted. “Investing in a low-carbon recovery makes sense whether you are worried about the economy or the environment. The two are inextricably linked,” said the former chief executive of Unilever Paul Polman, who signed the letter. Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, who has campaigned to have the 2013 death of her nine-year-old daughter from asthma officially linked to illegal levels of air pollution, said she hoped that as a father with a baby, Johnson would understand the impact. “This is not an elitist conversation, air pollution affects the poorest and vulnerable the most, and we need to continue the fight,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “Every time the prime minister goes ‘build, build, build’, I worry there’s nothing green about the initiatives,” said Kissi-Debrah, who is the World Health Organization’s advocate for health and air quality. Parents plan to gather outside the prime minister’s residence in Downing Street on Sunday to coincide with the letter, coordinated by climate activist groups Mothers Rise Up and Parents for Future UK. The parents, standing a metre apart, will carry hand-held wind turbines to symbolise the need for low-carbon investment. The British government has a binding target to cut its greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050. In June, Britain’s independent Committee on Climate Change said the country would have to move faster to achieve that goal."
" Just below the Arctic tundra, in the vast plains that blanket much of northern Russia, a once-unthinkable business is taking hold: soybean farming. It’s the result of years of rising global temperatures, which are thawing the permafrost and turning the land into fertile soil, and now Agronomist Gennady Bochkovsky is helping to take the crop to the next frontier, testing whether the beans can handle the upper areas of the Moscow region. So far, he says, the results are promising. “Sprouts have emerged and they look beautiful,” said Bochkovsky, who worked with farming company TulamashAgro to replace peas with soybeans on 1,400 hectares (3,460 acres). Soybeans in Russia embody a trend that’s sweeping the globe: warming weather is pushing crops further toward the poles than they’ve ever grown before. In the U.S., North Dakota has transformed into a major corn grower, and the U.K. has seen a rapid expansion in wine grapes. “You can see the climate is changing -- there’s more warmth and the crops that didn’t grow here before can now be successful,” Bochkovsky said. While Russian soybean farmers are seeing some benefits from warming weather, climate change has been wreaking havoc on global food production. Drought has hampered crop output this year in parts of Uruguay, New Zealand, Europe and Vietnam. Even Russia and the rest of the Black Sea region has seen the ill-effects of changing weather patterns in recent years, with drier conditions threatening the region’s wheat crop. The United Nations has said that climate change is one of the factors that’s exacerbated food insecurity, which means the world won’t reach a target to eliminate hunger by 2030. That’s happening at time when the coronavirus pandemic has upended normal supply chains and prevented food from getting where it needs to be. A period of extreme weather that devastates harvests could force countries to deploy more protectionist food policies, creating a ripple effect through global trade. Concerns over access to wheat and other staples led nations including Kazakhstan and Russia to introduce export restrictions earlier this year, though most countries have since backed off those restrictions and global grain supplies look to be ample. In Russia, farmers have embraced the opportunity to grow profitable soybeans. The oilseed is processed into animal feed, and demand has been strong amid a boom for livestock production. In fact, the nation still relies on imports of about 1 million metric tons of soy, so there’s more scope for domestic harvests to keep rising. Soybeans were planted on 1.1 million hectares in 2019 in central Russia, an 18-fold increase over the past decade and equal to about 7% of the total cropland in that part of the country. “The country needed more soybeans, and from an economic perspective, it’s better to grow them domestically,” said Sergei Zelentsov, who heads the soybean department at the Pustovoit All-Russian Research Institute of Oilseed Crops. The latest varieties of northern soybeans can grow if temperatures rise above 10 degrees Celsius (50 Fahrenheit) for long enough, according to Margarita Fadeyeva, a soybean breeder at the Chuvashia Agricultural Research Institute. In northern latitudes, they need about 100 days of favorable weather to ripen. Yields Double Yields have doubled over the past decade while output almost quadrupled, Russian government data show. That’s also been helped by better seeds coming to market. Still, there are tricks to getting the soy to do well in new areas.    "
" Floods are an annual feature of Assam’s calendar and 4-5 waves of deluge usually strike the state between April and August each year. But this year heavy rains, almost without any long break, has led to more suffering for the state’s residents who are already witnessing the third wave of floods this monsoon. “Usually we have a gap period between successive waves of floods in Assam, which allows water level in rivers to come down and flood waters to dry. But this year rainfall has been almost continuous for weeks and it has aggravated the situation. This is unusual,” said eminent water expert Dulal Goswami. “Though excess rainfall could be a factor, we have to consider that global climate change could also be responsible. According to a government study done in 2018, Assam was found to be the most vulnerable to changing climate among 12 states in the Indian Himalayan Region,” he added. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD) since the beginning of June, the state has recorded 20% more rainfall—894.4 mm till July 22 against the normal of around 743.9 mm. “We are witnessing a pattern in past few years where unlike in the past when rainfall used to get spread over a few months but now it seems most of the rainfall is taking place in one go,” said Mirza Zulfiqur Rahman, visiting research associate, Institute of Chinese Studies, Delhi. “Climate change is definitely a factor for this and such erratic events will continue. We need to see if we are prepared for this when 2-3 waves of floods happen almost at once. It is important to talk of floods as a livelihood issue and not discuss this only when the disaster strikes,” he added. Both experts said instead of piecemeal and sporadic efforts, a holistic approach needs to be taken to address the annual floods keeping into consideration people’s livelihoods and that Brahmaputra and other major rivers in the state have their own characteristics. As per Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) data, over 27 lakh people in 26 of the state’s 33 districts were still affected by floods on Friday. This season 96 persons have died due to drowning and another 26 in landslides caused by heavy rains. Over 50,000 displaced persons were taking shelter in 301 relief camps. Flood waters have also inundated over 1.22 hectares of crop area across the state. “We are witnessing the third wave of floods at present. Rainfall and flooding has been taking place since May end. While rainfall has taken place as per IMD prediction, climate change could be a reason for lack of gap between waves of floods,” said Pankaj Chakraborty, state project coordinator, ASDMA. Kaziranga still inundated by flood waters; Britain’s Prince William shocked Floods continue to affect Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR) with 85% of the park spread over 430 sq km inundated. This season 125 animals of the park including 13 rhinos (9 due to drowning and 4 due to natural causes) have died in and around the park. The situation at the park evoked reactions from Britain’s Prince William, the second in the line of succession to the British throne, who wrote to KNPTR director P. Sivakumar on July 21 expressing his and his wife Catherine’s feelings. “Catherine and I were heartbroken to hear about the appalling devastation to Kaziranga National Park and its precious wildlife caused by the very heavy monsoon flooding,” said the letter."
" Swedish activist Greta Thunberg urged European leaders on Thursday to take emergency action on climate change, saying people in power had practically “given up” on the possibility of handing over a decent future to coming generations. In an interview with Reuters television, the 17-year-old said governments would only be able to mount a meaningful response once they accepted they needed to transform the whole economic system. “We need to see it as, above all, an existential crisis. And as long as it’s not being treated as a crisis, we can have as many of these climate change negotiations and talks, conferences as possible. It won’t change a thing,” Thunberg said, speaking via video from her home in Stockholm. “Above all, we are demanding that we need to treat this crisis as a crisis, because if we don’t do that, then we won’t be able to do anything,” Thunberg said. Thunberg joined several thousand people, including climate scientists, economists, actors and activists in signing an open letter climateemergencyeu.org urging European leaders to start treating climate change like an “emergency.” The letter was made public on Thursday, a day before a European Council summit where countries in the 27-member EU will try to reach a deal on the bloc’s next budget and a recovery package to respond to the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. Demands in the letter included an immediate halt to all investments in fossil fuel exploration and extraction, in parallel with a rapid ending of fossil fuel subsidies. It also called for binding annual “carbon budgets” to limit how much greenhouse gas countries can emit to maximise the chances of capping the rise in average global temperatures at 1.5C, a goal enshrined in the 2015 Paris climate accord. “We understand and know very well that the world is complicated and that what we are asking for may not be easy. The changes necessary to safeguard humanity may seem very unrealistic,” the letter said. “But it is much more unrealistic to believe that our society would be able to survive the global heating we’re heading for, as well as other disastrous ecological consequences of today’s business as usual.”"
           
" A public hearing, which was conducted by Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) authorities via a video-link last week amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, for a sand mining project in the state’s Vidarbha region is among many such hurriedly-done exercises where local representations, who are critical in making interventions for the adverse environmental impact of a venture, are getting short shrift because of the pandemic. Around 14-15 representatives, mainly from the civil society and industry, took part, but there was no representation from the villages that could be adversely impacted because of the project, according to some of the participants in the public hearing. Another MPCB public hearing is slated to be held on Tuesday to discuss a proposal on sand mining in Bhandara. An MPCB official said locals are being represented by gram panchayats via a video-link, but they are also allowed to submit their objections in writing. “In the July 7 meeting, there was a participant from Hyderabad, who had a pro-sand mining stance. He has nothing to with the villages that are likely to be impacted. We are trying to understand how such public hearings are being conducted. If locals are called, at least 2,000-3,000 people would like their voices to be heard,” said Yash Marwah, a Maharashtra-based environmental activist. Public hearings, which give an opportunity to the community to make objections and suggestions on large infrastructure projects, are suffering because of the raging Covid-19 pandemic. Contentious projects with a large environmental footprint usually have a wide participation of over a thousand people during public hearings. The Union Ministry for Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) said respective state pollution control boards could determine the need for public hearings on a case-by-case basis. “Public hearing is decided and conducted by a state pollution control board or a district magistrate (DM). Depending on local conditions and the place of hearing, they may take a call. However, they have to ensure social distancing norms because of the pandemic,” said RP Gupta, secretary, MOEFCC. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs’ (MHA) guidelines under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, state that the public must maintain a six-feet distance from each other and large gatherings such as wedding receptions must not exceed 50 guests, and at a funeral, not more than 20 people are allowed to participate. Activists and community members, however, argue that allowing only 50 people to attend a public hearing compromise the rights of villagers to understand the project and make informed submissions. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) has issued a notice recently about a public hearing on Nayara Energy Limited’s proposal to expand its refinery and petrochemical complex from 20 million metric tonne per annum (MMTPA) to 46 MMTPA to be held on July 28 at Nayara Energy Limited on the Jamnagar-Okha highway. However, the notice doesn’t put a cap on the number of participants, despite the viral outbreak. “Nayara Energy is committed to strictly complying with all the regulations and directives of the public health authorities and government to combat Covid-19. The health and safety of our employees and communities are paramount for us. The upcoming public hearing is being organized by GPCB in consultation with district collectors (DCs). As directed by DCs/GPCB, we are taking appropriate precautionary measures that will enable compliance with Covid-19 norms,” said a Nayara Energy Limited spokesperson while responding to HT’s query on the public hearing. Karnataka and Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Boards have also announced a number of public hearings in July and August. Experts warned against these hurriedly conducted public hearings. “Public hearings are not a one-time event, which needs to be managed by the government. They are central to democratic decision-making, which is embedded in the environmental clearance processes,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research."
" A railway line proposed to be built in the Western Ghats, rejected by several statutory bodies in the past amid concerns that it could cause irreparable damage to prime forests and unique biodiversity in the region, received approval on March 20 from the State Board for Wildlife (SBWL), which rejected the project 11 days earlier. The SBWL approval was granted after the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL), under the union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC), started reviewing the project in Karntaka and asked about the reasons behind the delay in implementing it, documents reviewed by HT suggest. SBWL’s approval has resurrected the serious environmental concerns that held up the project for the past two decades. At least 101 scientists have endorsed a letter written by 11 ecologists and wildlife biologists to the NBWL member-secretary and MoEFCC minister Prakash Javadekar on July 2, raising several concerns about the Hubballi Ankola Railway Line Project (HARP) in Karnataka, including irreversible damage it could do to forests, fragmenting wildlife habitats in the Western Ghats, a global biodiversity hotspot and a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) world heritage site. The project is likely to come up for NBWL’s nod before other requisite clearances are sought. The proposed rail track will pass through a wildlife corridor between Bedthi Conservation Reserve (BCR) and Kali Tiger Reserve (KTR), a natural habitat for many species, including tigers and elephants. The project involves entails of felling of around 190,000 trees. The habitat of Great Pied and Malabar Pied Hornbills, both keystone species -- species critical for the survival of other species in the region -- are likely to have a major impact due to the project. It also passes through habitats that host many endemic and endangered species such as the Malabar Tree Toad, said the letter written by ecologists that quoted from various peer-reviewed papers in a bid to bolster their argument. The letter and details of the project have also been published on the Conservation India website that is spearheading a campaign to protect ecology. “No amount of mitigation will compensate for the damage to the ecosystem that will be lost for good. Ultimately, the well-being of local communities will be jeopardised,” the letter said. The Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot has already lost 33,000 square kilometres, or up to 40% of its forest cover, in the last 100 years, according to scientists. A significant proportion of this forest loss is attributed to linear projects such as power transmission lines, highways, and construction of dams. “The existing railway line (Tinai Ghat-Castlerock), located around 50 km north of the proposed site, along with several state roads and power lines have significantly contributed to fragmenting forests of the region and creating edges. Implementing HARP will create many more edges by splitting 10 large forest patches of conservation significance into 15 smaller patches,” said the letter, endorsed by scientists from various research organisations. They have argued that mitigation measures would not be able to counter the ecological impact. The project has in the past been rejected by the Supreme Court (SC)-constituted Central Empowered Committee (CEC) in 2015 and by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in 2018, according to documents seen by HT. The MoEFCC’s Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) had also raised several issues regarding the project. “The CEC is of the considered view that the project would cause huge and irreparable damage to forests, wildlife and biodiversity of the Western Ghats, which would far outweigh the actual tangible benefits of the project. The CEC report was based on a number of hearings, documents, and meetings with various senior Karnataka government officials,” the CEC had said while rejecting HARP. A MoEFCC letter to principal secretary (forests), Karnataka, dated September 29, 2018, had stated that a site inspection committee of NTCA has rejected the project because out of the six tiger-occupied landscapes in India; Western Ghats tops on habitat connectivity and contiguity counts. The project has come up, pending NBWL and other national-level approvals, despite a spate of rejections in the past. HT has seen the minutes of Karnataka SBWL meeting, which suggests that the project was rejected unanimously by board members and special invitees on March 9. The minutes suggest that a majority of SBWL members had opposed the project. The additional chief secretary (ACS), forests, Karnataka had said that since the rail network had already been strengthened in the Tinnaighat-Castlerock-Caranzol area, HARP was redundant. Karnataka chief secretary (CS), who was a special invitee to the SBWL meeting, cited the Centre’s enquiry regarding the delay in the project’s implementation. In the March 20 meeting, the Board reversed its own decision.     "
" Union Minister for Coal and Mines Pralhad Joshi has responded to a letter written by Chhattisgarh minister for forest Mohammad Akbar, urging him not auction the five coal blocks that fall under the environmentally-fragile Hasdeo Arand, Lemru elephant reserve and the catchment area of Mand river. Joshi’s letter, dated June 29, was received by the Chhattisgarh forest ministry on Tuesday evening, minister Akbar told HT. The letter stated that the Central ministry would conduct an investigation into the matter about the concerns raised by the state authorities regarding the proposed auctions for the five coal blocks. Earlier on June 21, Akbar had urged the Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Prakash Javadekar, and Minister Pralhad Joshi not to auction the coal blocks in the ecologically-sensitive zone. Akbar’s plea followed the Central government’s move to auction five coal blocks in the area -- Morga-2, Morga (south), Madanpur (north), Shyang, and Fatehpur (east), which are located between Hasdeo Arand and Mand rivers. The state government has also earmarked a 1,995-square (sq) kilometre (km) forest area around the Hasdeo Arand river as a natural habitat for wild elephants, called Lemru elephant reserve, amid a spike in the pachyderm-locals’ conflict in the region. State forest officials said that Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel also spoke to minister Joshi in early July, urging him for the exclusion for five coal blocks from the proposed auction. “Minister Akbar again wrote to Central minister Joshi and Javadekar on July 1, listing the five blocks, but we are yet to get any specific intimation whether the state government’s demands will be met,” said an official from the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO), requesting anonymity. Rakesh Chaturvedi, principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF), Chhattisgarh, said that the state government has not received any information from the Centre in writing, indicating that it is considering the demand for the exclusion of the five blocks from the proposed auction. Alok Shukla, convener, Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan, a pressure group that was formed in 2009 and works for tribal rights in Hasdeo Arand area, blamed the Central government for dragging its feet over the issue. “It’s hard to understand what further investigation does the Union ministry want to do? The list of coal blocks that will be auctioned is being prominently displayed on the ministry’s website since January while categorising them as ‘high conservation zones’. The Centre should pay heed to the state government’s plea and take off these five coal blocks on environmental grounds,” said Shukla. He also called the Centre’s bluff to the media that eight rounds of consultations have been held with the state government on the auction list. “If that’s the case, then why does the state government have to write several letters to the Union government citing environmental concerns?” he asked."
         
               
" Land degradation, wildlife exploitation, intensive farming and climate change are driving the rise in diseases that, like the coronavirus, are passed from animals to humans, United Nations experts said on Monday. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) jointly identified seven trends responsible for such diseases, known as zoonotic, calling on governments to take steps to stop future pandemics. These are: rising demand for animal protein, extraction of natural resources and urbanization, intensive and unsustainable farming, exploitation of wildlife, increased travel and transportation, food supply changes and climate change, it said. “The science is clear that if we keep exploiting wildlife and destroying our ecosystems, then we can expect to see a steady stream of these diseases jumping from animals to humans in the years ahead,” said UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen. “Pandemics are devastating to our lives and our economies, and as we have seen over the past months, it is the poorest and the most vulnerable who suffer the most. “To prevent future outbreaks, we must become much more deliberate about protecting our natural environment.” About 60% of known infectious diseases in humans and 75% of all emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, she said, largely due to the increased interaction between humans, animals and the environment. The new coronavirus, which is most likely to have originated in bats, has infected more than 11 million people and killed over half a million people globally, according to the Johns Hopkins University. But it is just one in a growing number of diseases – including Ebola, MERS, West Nile fever, Zika, SARS and Rift Valley fever – that have jumped from animal hosts into the human population in recent years, said the report. Around two million people, mostly in developing nations, die from neglected zoonotic diseases every year. These outbreaks not only cause severe illness and deaths, but also result in major economic losses for some of the world’s poorest. In the last two decades alone, zoonotic diseases have caused economic losses of more than $100 billion. This does not include the cost of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is expected to reach $9 trillion over the next few years, said the report. Most efforts to control zoonotic diseases have been reactive rather than proactive, say experts. They want governments to invest in public health, farm sustainability, end over-exploitation of wildlife and reduce climate change. Africa - home to a large portion of the world’s remaining intact rainforests as well as fast-growing human population - is at high risk of the increased emergence of zoonotic diseases - but could also provide solutions, said experts. “The situation on the continent today is ripe for intensifying existing zoonotic diseases and facilitating the emergence and spread of new ones,” said ILRI Director General Jimmy Smith. “But with their experiences with Ebola and other emerging diseases, African countries are demonstrating proactive ways to manage disease outbreaks.” He said some African nations had adopted a “One Health” approach - uniting public health, veterinary and environmental expertise which can help to identify and treat outbreaks in animals before they pass to humans. The experts urged governments to provide incentives for sustainable land use and animal husbandry and to develop strategies for producing food that do not rely on the destruction of habitats and biodiversity. Monday is World Zoonoses Day, which commemorates the work of French biologist Louis Pasteur, who successfully administered the first vaccine against rabies, a zoonotic disease, on July 6 1885.

" The early days of the lockdown were all about coming to terms with our vulnerability as a species. We learned about adversity, busied ourselves with adaptation and came to terms with our appalling lack of video skills. As Insta lives with celebs and Zoom webinars with experts took over the world in the following months, video chats became our solitary planet’s favourite leisure activity. As we flaunt our veteran lockdown status with perfectly-layered biryanis and closely-cropped hair, we can safely declare: along with decisive action on the climate change and social justice fronts, we need to collectively up our broadcast game. Please wait, the meeting host will let you in soon At a time when everyone is struggling to keeping body and mind together, anxious thoughts about one’s social image invade the head like a swarm of interstate locusts. It’s not enough, now, to have the perfect pizza in the oven and in pictures: you need to film the process, too, and share it with a hungry audience. This creates a new set of insecurities for the chronically gauche. Take, for instance, the pressure to join Zoom birthday parties. Yes, there are bigger issues at hand, like that elusive vaccine and your rapidly depleting kitchen repertoire. Added to these existential and culinary insecurities is the need to look cheerful. Now, how does one communicate excitement on a screen split with 17 other similarly burdened beings? Even the most hardened misanthrope will agree it was easier IRL. You could use cake as an excuse to make conversation, for one. Now it’s just the idea of cake, like a Platonic principle in a Beckettian universe. All that lit class training is finally coming in handy in this Era of Metaphors. Bookspotting No one can prepare you for a live video chat with a public audience. In my experience, 80 per cent of the time is spent on matters related to connectivity. You try to sync the conversation, piecing together the pixels on screen while trying to frantically communicate with your co-speaker using the comments thread. When it gets farcical, you start logging in and out, turning it into a complete slapstick. Along the way, people wave hands and send hearts and kisses – your spirits lift until you notice that all the enthusiasm is being generated by siblings, cousins and aunts. A superb Twitter thread decodes the physical books in the backgrounds of digital speakers. It lampoons the great pains we take to project our significant intelligence or artistic sensibilities. Now I can’t stop bookspotting while watching online interactions. A copy of Ulysses “carelessly” inserted in a talk about work-from-home clothing. A rare edition of The Communist Manifesto in a chat about dosa batter. A box set of The Discovery of India in a conversation about improving one’s video skills. As a result, I’m now paranoid about any book showing while I’m in a live chat, for fear of a takedown from someone as ruthless as myself. Resistance is futile The video chat trap is a tough one to avoid. I get that this distancing protocol will carry on for a while to come, but it (still) seems too unnatural to perform for one’s friends on camera. It doesn’t help that I’m transfixed by my own image on the screen, censuring every rebel lock of hair and overeager laugh. But saying no to the good-natured calls for a video chat marks you as a heartless automaton. And so, I repress my hair and suppress my apprehensions and take all the books out of a frame before settling in front of a mocking screen. Of course, this is overthinking it. Plus, the technologically advanced among you will no doubt be wondering why I don’t find a way to edit my image out of the frame. But that comes with its own dangers. What if I forget I’m on screen and do something really embarrassing? Like yawn extravagantly when someone evangelises about a new floor-cleaning gadget or fitness routine. I’m fully aware of the inevitability of my conversion.There’s nothing left to do but iron that neglected kurta, bring out the smudging kajal and moderate the nervous laughter.

" Climate change is having a discernible impact on glaciers in the western Himalayan region, studies by Jawaharlal Nehru University’s (JNU) glaciology unit in the School of Environmental Sciences has found. The results of their long-term monitoring of two glaciers, based on observational data and modelling exercises, in Himachal Pradesh (HP) and the Union Territory of Ladakh, have found that in the first decade of the new millennium glacier mass loss was significantly higher than in the late 20th century. While the glaciers will not disappear in the coming decades, the authors of the studies said, negative mass balance -- the net change in its mass over a balance year or fixed year -- of these slowly moving giant mass of ice is likely to have a profound impact on water availability for local communities. They also said that mass loss in glaciers in the region is mainly linked to rising temperatures and reduced snowfall. For the Ladakh study, published in the Journal of Glaciology on May 18, the team found that the Stok glacier is facing as much mass loss as its western Himalayan counterparts, despite being in a higher altitude zone between the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain ranges. The Stok glacier was in a balanced condition during the late 20th century -- around the 1980s --- due to sufficient winter precipitation, or snowfall. However, it was followed by a severe loss during the early 21st century -- prior to 2009 -- and a moderate loss after 2011. “This is mainly because of reduced winter snowfall in the arid Himalayan region. This must be also affecting water availability in villages in and around Stok and Indus river, which must be studied,” said JNU’s Professor AL Ramanathan, the corresponding author of the paper. The paper projects that a 27% increase in snow or rain is required to compensate for the mass loss due to 1 degree Celsius rise in temperature over pre-industrial era levels. “Accelerated temperature rise over the western Himalayas has significantly reduced the amount of snowfall received and also aggravated glacier mass loss,” he added. Another paper published in the same journal on June 23 is a study -- conducted between 2002 and 2019 --- of the Chhota Shigri glacier in HP. The team found over the past two decades, on average half a metre of water equivalent of ice has been drained from this glacier in the Indus river. The glacier is in an imbalanced condition because it has melted more than gained, the paper said. “Overall, the air temperature change is controlling the river run-off, which means a warmer world is likely to be associated with higher water in the Himalayan rivers till the 2050s, which other studies have also observed. There might be a seasonal shift in glacier run-off as well,” Ramanthan said. The country’s first national climate change assessment by the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences published in early June also flagged similar concerns. For instance, the Hindu Kush Himalayas (HKH) region experienced a temperature rise of about 1.3 degrees Celsius between 1951 and 2014, as compared to an average temperature rise of .7 degree over India from 1901 onwards. Several areas of the HKH region have experienced a declining trend in snowfall and also a retreat of glaciers in recent decades. “Several areas in the HKH region have exhibited declining trends in snowfall and retreating glaciers during the recent decades. Parts of the high-elevation Karakoram Himalayas have, in contrast, experienced increased wintertime precipitation in association with enhanced amplitude variations of synoptic western disturbance,” the assessment has said."
" Indicator of pollution levels in the Himalayas, Uttarakhand forest department has claimed to have developed country’s first lichen park in Kumaon’s Munsiyari area, spread over 1.5 acres with over 80 species of lichens collected from across the Himalayan state. Considered most significant bio-indicator of ecosystem fluctuations as they are more sensitive towards habitat and climate changes, lichen species are facing many threats and continue to decline from some areas of Himalayan regions because of overexploitation of natural resources, mounting pressures of urbanization, habitat-destruction, deforestation and increasing pollution, according to forest officials. Sanjiv Chaturvedi, Conservator of Forests (Research Wing) Uttarakhand said, lichens found in the Himalayas up to 5000 metres, are important species as they are the best bioindicators of the pollution levels. “Lichen need pure air to grow. If pollution levels increase in a certain area, the lichen species decline there. So it serves as a natural indicator of pollution levels in an area. And they are important to study in the Himalayas, given various threats to Himalayan environment and ecology” In July last year, HT had reported that state forest department had approved research project for studying lichens in the Himalayan state. The project aims to study the distribution of different lichen species, their habitat, their morphological and physiological aspects, surveying and literature review, the establishment of species, current threats to their habitat including anthropological and climatic factors, and coming up with suitable conservation strategies and protection strategies. Chaturvedi said these Jurassic-era lichen species are used in food, perfumes, dyes and traditional medicines. “Our aim of developing this Lichen Park is to create awareness among people here about their importance in the overall Himalayan ecology and how to link livelihood of these locals with these species and check their incriminate exploitation. One of the lichen species called Jhula Ghas is used as a flavouring agent in Hyderabadi biryani and some non-vegetarian dishes in North Indian cuisine. Their potential for antibiotics and sunscreen chemicals is also being explored by researchers. Some species can also withstand high levels of radiation and can be used as biological sensors that give us information about the environment”, said Chaturvedi. “We chose Munsiyari area for the park as it has a rich diversity of lichen species. Over 120 lichen species are found in this area. So it was easy for us to develop the park here”, he said According to experts, Uttarakhand has more than 600 species of lichens followed by Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir with 503 and 386 species respectively. In Uttarakhand lichens are found in Chamoli, Champawat, Pithoragarh, Nainital, Dehradun region. Some lichen species found in the state include Parmotrema pertatum, Usnea lognissima, Lecanora subfuseescens, Sarcogyne privigna, Arthonia impolitella, Acarospora fusca, Acarospora oxytona, Polysporina dubia and so on. What is a lichen? A lichen is a composite organism that arises from algae or cyanobacteria living among filaments of multiple fungi species in a mutualistic relationship. They come in many colours, sizes and forms. The properties are sometimes plant-like but lichens are not plants. Lichens may have tiny, leafless branches, flat leaf-like structures."
" From creating jobs in home insulation to hiking dirty fuel taxes and expanding electric-vehicle charging, Britain’s government should harness the Covid-19 pandemic to accelerate cuts in planet-heating emissions, an advisory panel said on Thursday. With public support for low-carbon shifts growing and the state spending billions to boost its flagging economy, now is “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to ramp up the transition, said John Gummer, chair of Britain’s Committee on Climate Change. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage “If we are to emerge successfully from Covid-19, there is only one route and that route is one that enables us also to fight climate change,” said the head of the independent advisory body, which released its annual progress report on Thursday. That document said Britain was moving toward its commitment, made a year ago, to produce no more emissions than it can offset or store by 2050 - but steps so far “do not yet measure up to the size of the net-zero challenge”. To speed up action, the government should use the coronavirus crisis - including fresh public concern about unexpected risks and willingness to change behaviour - to push ahead on new climate-smart policies, the report said. Those should include retrofitting homes and buildings to make them more energy-efficient, which would provide work in all regions, it noted, as well as strengthening the electricity supply network to support increased use of renewable power. The country’s emerging electric-vehicle charging network should be rapidly expanded, and only new vehicles that are zero emissions sold by 2032, it said. Work on flood defences, as climate risks rise, should also be brought forward, it urged. Efforts to train workers for low-carbon jobs, to ensure a fair green transition, should be a priority, along with protecting nature through more forest protection and tree planting, and better managing agricultural land, it added. Even improving Britain’s broadband network - to enable more people to work at home - could have big climate benefits, said Chris Stark, chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change. And hiking fossil fuel taxes now while oil prices are low could raise $15 billion over the next decade in badly needed new tax revenue - and help push people towards low-carbon alternatives, he said. “We are not short of ideas of what can be done here,” Stark told an online briefing, noting many of the proposed changes “stack up on straight economic grounds” as well as making sense for climate action. Renewable power - in large part from offshore wind - is now the cheapest electricity option in Britain, he said, one reason the country’s emissions dropped by more than 3% last year even as global emissions continued to rise. With Britain moving to the final stage of leaving the European Union at the end of 2020, clean power could be one pillar of its new post-Brexit identity, he said. “We’re almost at the point where you can envision an energy system based on renewables, especially wind, and no one blinks when you say it. It’s absolutely amazing,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview. ‘WIN-WIN’ Adair Turner, a senior fellow at the Institute for New Economic Thinking, a New York-based think-tank, said government spending on things from renewable energy to home retrofits and tree planting could quickly create jobs while curbing emissions. “This is a clear win-win opportunity which must be seized,” he said in a statement. Camilla Toulmin, a senior associate with the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development, said Britain - host of the delayed COP26 U.N. climate talks - could not afford “a slowdown or delay to climate action in 2020”. Climate impacts are being felt both abroad and in Britain, she said in a statement, noting that despite the global pandemic “the climate crisis has not stopped”. Climate activist group Extinction Rebellion said some of its members planned to protest on Thursday at the Treasury in London against what they saw as “criminal inaction” by the government so far toward achieving its net-zero goal. That goal was enshrined in law last year following large-scale street protests and other civil disobedience by the grassroots movement and other climate campaign groups. The Committee on Climate Change report draws on recommendations made by the Climate Assembly UK, a citizen panel set up by several parliamentary committees with members selected to reflect the demographics of Britain’s diverse population. Nearly 80% of the assembly’s 108 members agreed in a secret ballot that government steps to boost the economy after Covid-19 should be designed to help achieve Britain’s net-zero target. And almost all - 93% - agreed that, as the virus lockdown eases, the state, employers and others should encourage shifts in lifestyles to become more compatible with reaching net-zero. Gummer said Committee on Climate Change members hoped the government would rapidly turn many of their recommendations into policy that is then quickly put into practice. “What we don’t want from the government is a lot of good-hearted statements (and) the beginnings of policies that are not being implemented,” he said."
" Five Indian-origin women engineers based in the UK are among ‘Top 50 Women in Engineering for 2020’ awards judged by a panel of industry experts on Tuesday – the International Women in Engineering Day. The awards, now in its fifth year, seek to recognise the wealth of female talent within engineering. It is an annual celebration aligned with International Women in Engineering Day, which takes place on June 23, coordinated by the Women’s Engineering Society. The theme for 2020 is ‘Sustainability’: celebrating female engineers who are making a significant contribution to achieving net zero carbon. The five awardees are: Ritu Garg: senior transport engineer, Arup. Garg’s work involves formulating and delivering sustainable transport solutions. She recently produced a paper for UK local authorities providing practical guidance on addressing climate emergency in transport. Garg is part of a global initiative helping national governments unlock the economic power of zero-carbon sustainable cities. Barnali Ghosh: technical director, Mott MacDonnald. An experienced seismic engineer, Ghosh focuses on developing seismic resilience in infrastructure, using the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs). She was seismic lead on a sustainable water project in Dhaka, which will supply drinking water to 4 million people and has undertaken research into the effects of climate change on anti-seismic devices. Anusha Shah: director – resilient cities, Arcadis. A Fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Shah supports organisations to meet net zero targets and become climate resilient. As UK’s Environment Agency account leader, she is supporting it to achieve its net zero target by 2030. She uses many different platforms to constantly raise climate change awareness. Kusum Trikha: senior engineer, WSP. Trikha specialises in multi-million-pound low-carbon energy projects. She managed the multi-disciplinary design team for the 10.3 MW electric Birmingham Bio Power Plant renewable project, a biomass gasification plant in the UK, which effectively captures all the carbon dioxide it produces to generate clean electricity. Chitra Srinivasan: real-time control software engineer, UK Atomic Energy Authority (UAEA). Srinivasan has worked on SDGs related to poverty eradication and solving climate crisis. Her work at the authority involves using research to produce zero carbon energy and work towards environmental sustainability. Srinivasan said: “I am an upcoming engineer in fusion research and this achievement is highly encouraging for me…At UKAEA, I have the opportunity to research sustainable energy by developing computer codes to control the fuel inside fusion machines. We are copying the process that powers the Sun for greener electricity.” On ‘Sustainability’ as the theme for this year’s awards, Elizabeth Donnelly of the Women’s Engineering Society added: “The 2019 Climate Emergency Declarations followed unprecedented weather conditions across the planet”."
" Preparing for her appearance before the U.N. General Assembly last fall, Greta Thunberg found herself constantly interrupted by world leaders, including U.N. chief Antonio Guterres and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had formed a queue to speak to her and take selfies. “Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, waits in line but doesn’t quite make it before it’s time for the event to start,” Thunberg recalls. Such surreal memories for a teenager form the opening to a 75-minute monologue broadcast on Swedish public radio Saturday that soon shifts to the serious matter of climate change that’s at the heart of Thunberg’s work. The 17-year-old has become a global figurehead of the youth climate movement since she started her one-woman protests outside the Swedish parliament in 2018. Thunberg’s blunt words to presidents and prime ministers, peppered with scientific facts about the need to urgently cut greenhouse gas emissions, have won her praise and awards, but also the occasionalpushback and even death threats. To Thunberg’s disappointment, her message doesn’t seem to be getting through even to those leaders who applaud her work. The message is certainly stark: Thunberg cites a U.N. report that estimates the world can only keep emitting the current amount of carbon dioxide for the next seven-and-a-half years. Any longer and it becomes impossible to meet the Paris climate accord’s ambitious goal of keeping global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) this century. Most governments refuse to accept the idea that the world has only a fixed “carbon budget” left, because it implies that a sudden shift away from fossil fuel will need to happen in just a few years. “Do you remember the London Olympics? ‘Gangnam Style’ or the first ‘Hunger Games’ movie?” Thunberg asks her audience on Swedish radio station P1. “Those things all happened about seven or eight years ago. That’s the amount of time we’re talking about.” Her months-long journey from Sweden to America’s West Coast and back — by train, sailboat and an electric car loaned by Arnold Schwarzenegger — highlighted the impact that global warming is already having, from melting glaciers to fiercer forest fire seasons, Thunberg said. It also opened her eyes to economic and social disparities affecting in particular Indigenous, Black and minority communities, voices she has sought to amplify in the climate debate. “The climate and sustainability crisis is not a fair crisis,” Thunberg says. “The ones who’ll be hit hardest from its consequences are often the ones who have done the least to cause the problem in the first place. ” Her frustration extends to journalists who want to know about “the real Greta” but interrupt her when she talks about the science of climate change. “People want something simple and concrete, and they want me to be naive, angry, childish, and emotional,” Thunberg says. “That is the story that sells and creates the most clicks.” Thunberg blasts governments and businesses that use what she calls “creative accounting” to makes their emissions look lower than they are and apply the word “green” to industries that are not. “The emperors are naked. Every single one,” she says. “It turns out our whole society is just one big nudist party.” Some critics have accused Thunberg of being a doom-monger. But she insists that her message is one of hope, not despair. “There are signs of change, of awakening,” she says. “Just take the ‘Me Too’ movement, ‘Black Lives Matter’ or the school strike movement (for climate action) for instance,” she says, adding that the world has passed a “social tipping point” where it becomes impossible to look away. The global response to the Covid-19 pandemic may provide a necessary wake-up call, she suggests."
" Uttarakhand forest department authorities along with Wildlife Institute of India (WII) is planning to put radio collars on some of the elephants, which are prone to straying into human habitations, in a bid to prevent attacks on pilgrims, who are expected to congregate in Haridwar for the next year’s Mahakumbh. The state government is waiting for the approval from the Central government before putting into motion the radio-collar exercise. State forest department officials said elephants usually venture into areas, where tents are set up for the Mahakumbh pilgrims. Rajiv Bhartari, chief wildlife warden, Uttarakhand, said select elephants would be radio-collared after the Central government gives its nod. “The radio collars are available with the state government. The WII authorities have also conducted a study. We’re only waiting for the Centre’s approval,” he said. Last September, the Rajaji Tiger Reserve landscape in the state was chosen for a pilot project on man-wildlife conflict mitigation by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC). The MoEFCC, along with the German institution, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), conducted a national workshop on ways to lessen human-wildlife conflict in the region, which has been on an upswing. Bhartari said GIZ authorities donated a Maruti-Gypsy vehicle, 15 and 13 radio collars for leopards and elephants, respectively, and kits for training three rapid response teams six primary response teams, respectively, to Rajaji Tiger Reserve authorities. Rajaji officials said they have 13 radio collars for elephants, which would be used to develop strategies to reduce man-pachyderm conflict during the next year’s Mahakumbh. Dr. Aditi Sharma, a senior veterinarian at Rajaji Tiger Reserve, who is supervising the selection of the elephants that will be radio-collared, said the precautionary drive would lessen the man-pachyderm conflict during the Mahakumbh next year, where hundreds and thousands of pilgrims are expected to participate. She said the identification process of the elephants, which would be radio-collared is underway. Forest staff has also mapped the movement of the elephants in the area, she added. Tedhipuliya, near Haridwar, has been found to be the most prone to man-elephant conflict, forest officials said. “Those elephants, which stray into human habitations, will be radio-collared. We’ll get a sense of their movement pattern after they’re radio-collared and work out a mechanism to prevent man-elephant conflicts,” Sharma said. The forest officials had started their preparations from last November, when man-animal hotspots were identified and geo-tagged. Response teams at multiple levels were formed and a geo-tagged map was prepared by the Haridwar forest division authorities by collating information on all the conflict incidents over the past two years. The geo-tagged map holds the key in providing precise information to the forest officials on how frequently a conflict occurred in a said area and it also helps them to devise an effective strategy to contain similar incidents in the near future."
" The year 2020 has been all about heat. A deep dive into ­population data and warming projections suggest that our 6,000-year era of just-right temperatures may be coming to an end. Barring mass migration, a third of humanity may live in Sahara-like conditions by 2070.  Lethal combinations of heat and humidity hadn’t been projected to appear until after midcentury, but a megastudy of 40 years of hourly weather-station data from all over the world finds that the Persian Gulf and Indus River Valley are already flirting with deadly conditions. The same study shows that episodes of extraordinary humidity and heat have doubled in ­frequency since 1979. Antarctica saw its hottest day on record, reaching 18.4C on Feb. 6—only days before an iceberg bigger than Tampa broke off the continent. Europe’s winter was the warmest it’s measured to date. Australia’s ­second-hottest summer caused the Great Barrier Reef its second-worst bleaching in 40 years of observation. And centuries of tree-ring data, combined with water-cycle models, show that human-driven warming transformed what would have been simply another dry spell into the American Southwest’s second-worst drought in 1,200 years.  It’s not the End Times—yet. But scientists analyzing data on environmental change in 42 major ecosystems found that some may be inching closer to collapse than we thought. To make matters worse, a 30-year study of tropical forests indicates trees aren’t drawing down our carbon dioxide emissions as well as they used to. In the last decade they absorbed a third less CO2 than they did in the 1990s—a total of 21 billion metric tons less. That’s the equivalent of about 10 years of emissions from France, Germany, and the U.K. combined. Meanwhile, clouds remain a puzzle. An unusually cloudless sky above Greenland last summer led to the biggest drop in the ice sheet’s mass ever recorded—and yet clouds that did appear over the northern and western parts of the island helped trap heat that would otherwise have escaped, causing even more melting. Climate scientists continue to debate the unusually hot results from the latest generation of climate models, which started producing worrisome forecasts last year. One explanation: The way the models treat clouds may be skewing results hotter. And if all that weren’t strange enough, record-breaking rainfall in Hawaii in 2018 may have triggered the eruptions at Kilauea that caused two dozen injuries and $800 million in property damage. It does get happier. Eunice Foote, the amateur American scientist who wrote the first known paper on the heat-trapping potential of CO2 in 1856 and then disappeared from posterity, has been rediscovered and restored to her proper place in climate history. And the ozone hole, which dominated global environmental ­discussions in the 1980s, has shrunk by about 20% over the past 15 years, which scientists attribute to the landmark 1987 treaty banning the materials that caused it.  Don’t take that progress for granted, however. In addition to a recent rise in ­illegal ozone-­destroying chemicals, scientists discovered that the substances are also ­leaking from pre-1987 infrastructure as it ages.

" The average temperature over India is projected to rise by 4.4 degrees Celsius, while the intensity of heat waves is likely to increase by 3-4 times by the end of the century, according to a government report on the impact of climate change on the country. India’s average temperature has risen by around 0.7 degree Celsius during 1901–2018, largely on account of Green House Gases-induced warming, states the report by the Ministry of Earth Sciences. It is likely to be published by Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday. The report has been prepared by the Centre for Climate Change Research, a cell under MoES’ Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune. “By the end of the twenty-first century, average temperature over India is projected to rise by approximately 4.4 degrees Celsius,” the report states. In the 30-year period between 1986 and 2015, temperatures of the warmest day and the coldest night of the year have risen by about 0.63 degrees Celsius and 0.4 degree Celsius, respectively. By the end of the century, the temperatures of the warmest day and the coldest night are projected to rise by approximately 4.7 degrees Celsius and 5.5 degrees Celsius, respectively, according to the report. The frequencies of occurrence of warm days and warm nights are projected to increase by 55 per cent and 70 per cent, it says. “The frequency of summer (April–June) heat waves over India is projected to be 3 to 4 times higher by the end of the twenty-first century,” the report states. The average duration of heat wave events is also projected to approximately double. The combined rise in surface temperature and humidity, amplification of heat stress is expected across India, particularly over the Indo-Gangetic and Indus river basins, the report notes. Sea Surface Temperature (SST) of the tropical Indian Ocean has risen by a degree Celsius on average during 1951–2015, markedly higher than the global average SST warming of 0.7 degree Celsius, over the same period, the report states. Sea Surface Temperatures does have an influence over the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean Dipole is linked to the SSTs of the Indian Ocean. A positive IOD, linked to the cooling/warming of the Indian Ocean waters, generally helps to have a good monsoon. Sea-level in the North Indian Ocean (NIO) has risen at a rate of 1.06–1.75 millimetre per year during 1874–2004 and has accelerated to 3.3 millimetre per year in the last two and a half decades (1993–2017), which is comparable to the current rate of global mean sea-level rise."
" Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg can add to her list of personal accolades, including TIME magazine’s Person of the Year, a group of spiders named after her. Thunberga gen. nov. is a new genus of huntsman spiders from Madagascar, described by German arachnologist Peter Jager, and named after the wunderkind in honour of her commitment to tackling climate change. “The rising temperatures affect all areas of nature -- including the endemic diversity and spider fauna of Madagascar,” said Jager, who has participated in several protests inspired by Thunberg’s School Strike for Climate. In a study printed in the scientific journal Zootaxa, Jager explained that the new genus differed from other huntsmans in their eye arrangement and unique dotted patterns on their backs. Jager, who has discovered several new spider species in a career spanning 20 years, said he hoped that by naming the creepy crawlies after Thunberg he could draw attention to the issue of biodiversity loss in Madagascar. He named a previous discovery of Southeast Asian huntsman spider Heteropoda davidbowie. Unlike most spiders, huntsman don’t spin webs and hunt and forage instead for their food. During his latest expedition, Jager also discovered a heretofore unknown species of huntsman on the island. Its name? Thunberga greta."
" By the end of the 21st century, the number of warm days and warm nights in India is likely to be 55-70% higher compared to the average number between 1976 and 2005, according to the worst climate change scenario listed in the country’s first national climate change assessment by the ministry of earth sciences. And the frequency of summer heat waves is likely to be three to four times higher and their duration, likely to double . The report, to be released on Tuesday said that in the 29 years from 1986 to 2015, India has recorded several weather extremes --- such as an increase in warm days and nights and a rise in extremely severe cyclonic storms over the Arabian Sea --- that were a result of human-caused climate change. Rapid changes in India’s climate will put stress on ecosystems, agricultural output and freshwater resources, and also cause damage to infrastructure, the report, available on publishing platform Springer and seen by HT, added. “These portend serious consequences for the country’s biodiversity, food, water and energy security, and public health…higher temperatures, extreme weather events, and higher climate variability have been associated with an elevated risk of heat strokes, cardiovascular and neurological diseases, and stress-related disorders,” the report said. Under all climate change scenarios, the extremes will only intensify. For example, temperatures of the warmest day and the coldest night of the year increased by 0.63 degree Celsius and 0.4 degree Celsius, respectively, in the 29-year period. “India has witnessed a rise in average temperature; a decrease in monsoon precipitation; a rise in extreme temperature and rainfall events, droughts, and sea levels; and an increase in the intensity of severe cyclones, alongside other changes in the monsoon system. There is compelling scientific evidence that human activities have influenced these changes in regional climate,” the report, drafted by scientists from Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology said. The number of warm days have increased by about 9.9 per decade and warm nights by 7.7 per decade, the report said. Cold nights have decreased by 3.3 per decade during this period. Warm days or nights are those when maximum and minimum temperatures are over the 90th percentile. “Heat action plans need to be further developed and calibrated. We need to track what kind of changes in health impacts we are seeing…In the long term, our infrastructure needs to be heat-resistant or mortality will increase; cool roofs, efficient cooling should be a part of policy,” said Dr Dileep Mavalankar, director, Indian Institute of Public Health Gandhinagar, Gujarat. India’s average temperature has risen by around 0.7 degree Celsius during 1901–2018, which may not reflect these extremes. The largest increase in the annual mean temperature of more than 0.2 degree Celsius per decade was observed in some areas of north India between 1986 and 2015. The warming is much weaker in the southern peninsula. With increase in air temperature, sea surface temperature over the Indian Ocean has already risen abnormally by 1 degree Celsius in the 64 years between 1951 and 2015 compared to the global average sea surface warming of 0.7 degree Celsius. The frequency of extremely severe cyclonic storms (ESCS) over the Arabian Sea has increased during the post-monsoon seasons of 1998–2018. Most models are projecting a higher sea surface warming in the Arabian Sea than the Bay of Bengal. Oxygen concentrations and marine phytoplankton have declined in the recent decades. “It’s a first for India. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change produces such reports for global impact assessment. This national report can help policymakers in different sectors specially health and agriculture. We plan to do this review every four to five years,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, the ministry of earth sciences. The report has also underlined that climate change has already skewed the monsoon patterns with rains decreasing by 6% between 1951 and 2015. The Indo-Gangetic Plains and Western Ghats have recorded the highest declines, but the frequency of extreme rainfall (over 150 mm) has increased by 75% between 1950 and 2015 in central India. There is a shift towards more frequent dry spells (27% higher than the 1951-1980 period) and more intense wet spells during the summer monsoon season. High elevations of the Tibetan Plateau recorded severe warming as high as 0.5 degree Celsius per decade, according to the report. The projections in the assessment report are based on the climate models used in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and climate change modeling studies using the IITM Earth System Model (ESM) and CORDEX South Asia datasets. The report has warned of a cascade of climate-related hazards, which will overlap. For instance, a region may experience an abnormally long or intense summer heat wave followed by intense monsoon floods that alternate with lengthening dry spells. “Low-lying coastal zones, especially on India’s east coast, may witness rising sea levels damaging property and increasing groundwater salinity. A rise in cyclone intensities will likely result in increasing inundation from the accompanying storm surges that turn proximate agricultural lands and lakes saline, and imperil wildlife,” the report added."
" In recent years, the leaders and inhabitants of many small-island nations like Kiribati and Tuvalu have warned that climate change is an existential threat to their homelands, fearing they could disappear under rising seas as the planet warms. But according to research published on Wednesday, small, low-lying islands dotted around the Pacific and the Caribbean - often seen as the places most vulnerable to global warming - can naturally adapt and raise themselves above encroaching waves. A three-year study led by Britain’s University of Plymouth, which looked at coral reef islands such as the Maldives and the Marshall Islands, found that tides move sediment to create higher elevation, a process that may keep the islands habitable. “The dominant discourse is that of an island drowning, and the outcome of that is coastal defences and relocation ... We think there are more trajectories for the islands,” said lead author Gerd Masselink, professor of coastal geomorphology at the University of Plymouth. Low-lying island states are judged to be at greatest risk from increasingly powerful storms and rising oceans, with some making preparations to resettle their people within decades. Many are already building sea walls, moving coastal villages to higher ground, appealing for international aid or setting up projects to repair damage caused by climate change impacts. The world’s tens of thousands of coral reef islands are mostly uninhabited, but are home to about 1 million people who largely rely on fishing or tourism for a living, said Masselink. Although the islands have different structures due to varying weather and wave patterns, they tend to be relatively small, low-lying, sandy or gravel islands sitting on top of a living reef platform. They were formed hundreds of thousands of years ago by waves moving and piling up reef material or sediment to create higher ground - a natural defence mechanism that continues, he noted. For the study published in the journal Science Advances, scientists built a model coral reef and island in a laboratory tank with rising water levels, and used computer simulations to replicate how such islands respond to higher seas in reality. The results suggest that by opting for climate-resilient infrastructure that allows for occasional flooding, like buildings on stilts and movable houses, islanders with enough space could adapt to their shifting environment, Masselink said. Dredging coral sand and sediments found in island lagoons and moving it to beaches could also aid the natural process of raising the islands, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Sea walls, however, are compromising the natural ability of the islands to adjust to rising sea levels, he said. “If you stop the flooding of the islands, you also stop the movement of the sediment on top of the island,” he said. Most coral islands do not depend on agriculture, and import food and fresh water, making saltwater contamination during flooding less of an issue, he noted. Hideki Kanamaru, natural resources officer with the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization in Asia-Pacific, said the study provided a “new perspective” on how island nations could tackle the challenge of sea-level rise. But even if islands can adapt naturally to higher seas by raising their own crests, humans still need to double down on global warming and protection for island populations, he added.

" India is considering a universal basic income and will not consider a repeal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers ) Act or a moratorium on the death penalty, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has told the United Nations. In a first, NHRC, submitted a mid-term report to the United Nations on the human rights situation in the country , highlighting the government’s policies on climate change, rights of women, children, disabled, and the elderly, and the right to food, work and health. In the report, Universal Periodic Review (UPR)-III, the UN has been informed that the Indian government is examining and “actively considering” the possibility of a universal basic income to reduce poverty. Universal basic income (UBI) refers to periodic cash transfers to every citizen. The government has focused cash transfer schemes aimed at farmers, especially, but no universal cash transfer programme. As part of UPR-III, the Indian government accepted 152 recommendations out of 250 by 112 UN member states in September 2017 pertaining to poverty alleviation, rights of women, children, persons with disabilities, elderly, marginalized populations and right to education etc. However, it refused to accept 98 recommendations including repeal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers ) Act, a moratorium on the death penalty, violence against marginalized groups and concerns over the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), a law regulating foreign funding to non-governmental organizations etc. UPR is an international peer review mechanism based on a periodic self-assessment by each country of its human rights record, achievements and challenges, which is supplemented by reports from UN human rights experts, entities, treaty bodies, national human rights institutions, and civil society organizations. India was one of the first countries to be reviewed under the UPR mechanism. In the mid-term report submitted last month, accessed by Hindustan Times, NHRC has listed passing of Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, which criminalizes instant Triple Talaq, as a key step in eliminating discrimination against women. It has also listed government flagship schemes such as the PM Awas Yojana affordable housing initiative , the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, the Swachh Bharat Mission, and the Ujjwala scheme of free cooking gas connections for the poor. Civil society organizations, which are part of the Working Group of Human Rights (WGHR), say NHRC has done the bidding of the government of India rather than giving an independent view on the human rights conditions in India. Henri Tiphagne, executive director of the People’s Watch, said: “We are quite surprised because this NHRC UPR report reads like a government of India report. Many events have taken place (since India accepted the recommendations of UN member countries) but nothing has been mentioned in the report. The report doesn’t show the independent view of NHRC”. Sanjoy Hazarika, director of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, welcomed NHRC submitting a mid-term report but added that the non-government organisation was meeting in couple of days to brainstorm on the findings. A 12-member Working Group of Human Rights (WGHR) for India, which includes CHRI, will prepare its own report and send it to the UN. NHRC chairperson, justice (retd) H L Dattu, said, “This (mid-term) report addresses all the recommendations given by the UN members for the central government during last review meeting (in September 2017 in Geneva). The UPR is significant because it takes into account issues pertaining to human rights including poverty, religious issues, women rights etc.” Asked about NHRC’s role in the whole process, Dattu said, “The Commission has the role of an onlooker as these recommendations are for the central government (to address).”"
            
" The Covid-19 pandemic has infected at least 6 million people and killed over 395,000 across the world. It has also created a huge economic disruption. An April 2020 estimate by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said global gross domestic product (GDP) would contract by 3% in 2020. Even in 2009, the year after the global financial crisis, world GDP contracted by only 1.7%. The economic pain of the pandemic will be felt the world over. But it will play out differently. How it does will depend on three factors. First, the economic situation before the pandemic hit. Second, how the pandemic interacts with existing economic and social fault lines. And third, the policy response to the pandemic. What will be the pandemic’s impact on India? The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expects the Indian economy to contract in the current fiscal year. But given the recent release of GDP numbers for the quarter ending March 2020, a big-picture analysis may be needed. In a three-part data journalism series, of which this is the first, HT attempts to do exactly that. The first part will look at the economic situation before the pandemic and dwell on its nature and causes. The second will look at the immediate effects of the crisis and their macroeconomic consequences. The third part will argue that the existing policy response may not be enough. ALSO WATCH | Modi govt’s mega MSME boost: First step to self-reliant India? Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverage India’s GDP growth has been declining since 2017-18. Such a prolonged slowdown is unprecedented in India . Why did this happen? Will this affect our ability to deal with the economic disruption caused by the pandemic? Any modern economy is a giant market. Everybody is a buyer or a seller. Workers sell their labour, businesses their products and services. Essential and non-essential spending decisions feed into each other. And everything is linked. Consider an economy made up of shirt sellers and hoteliers. If all shirt sellers do not take a vacation, the hotel industry will face a severe squeeze. If the hotel business enters bad times, its workers will not buy shirts. This will hurt the shirt sellers. If the crisis in the shirt and hotel industry is prolonged, it will lead to a fall in demand for sewing machines (used in making shirts) and bed linen (used in hotels). If left unaddressed, this will unleash a vicious cycle of sorts. This is what makes the role of the government important. So what should be done to prevent a cascading impact of shirt sellers’ decision to not take vacations? The answer depends on the nature of the problem confronting the shirt industry. Economists classify all such problems into two categories: demand side versus supply side, and structural versus cyclical. In the demand-supply binary, if all people who were buying shirts suffered a pay cut, or worse, lost their jobs, they would buy fewer or no shirts at all. This is a demand-side problem. Any resolution has to be focused on boosting the incomes of those who buy shirts. But if the shirt factory is using old machines and does not have enough money to buy modern ones; it cannot supply enough shirts to the shirt seller. This is a supply- side problem. What is needed in this case is cheap credit to make the modern machine affordable. It is important to get the intervention right. A problem of fewer shirts being produced cannot be solved by a government payout to shirt buyers. This will only lead to more competitive bidding for shirts. Shirt prices will go up further. Similarly, availability of cheap credit will not help if shirt buyers do not have money to buy shirts. The shirt factory will either not take credit, or accumulate more debt, as revenue remains stagnant. Then there is the structural vs cyclical aspect. A shirt seller might suffer a slowdown in sales during winters. The demand will revive once summer starts. The shirt seller might need some short-term credit during winters. However, if climate change were to lead to a prolonged winter, then annual shirt sales may suffer a permanent hit. Waiting for summer will not fix the problem. A short-term loan will only make matters worse. Why did India’s economy start slowing? At an event in December last year, chief economic advisor Krishnamurthy Subramanian claimed that “the current (economic) slowdown is a lot more on the cyclical side”. We now have GDP data up to 2019-20. The Indian economy has been losing growth momentum for three consecutive years beginning 2017-18. GDP growth was 8.3% in 2016-17. It fell to 7% in 2017-18, 6.1% in 2018-19 and 4.2% in 2019-20. The economy has never lost growth momentum for three consecutive years since 1991-92. And it has happened only twice before. Between 1989-90 and 1991-92, and before that from 1970-71 to 1972-73. The year 1990-91 saw massive disruptions due to the first Gulf War. And 1971 was the year of the Bangladesh war. These are extraordinary shocks. To be sure, the Covid-19 pandemic did disrupt economic activity towards the end of the last quarter of 2019-20. However, even earlier estimates had projected slower growth for the year than 2018-19. That India’s growth momentum slowed for three years without an external shock, raises doubts on the validity of claims of a cyclical slowdown. (See Chart 1)   The government’s policy response until 2019-20 was largely a supply-side response. In September 2019, the government slashed corporate tax rates. This was expected to promote investment and boost the economy. RBI has mostly either reduced interest rates or kept them stable. This was expected to reduce the cost of capital and promote investment. The investment component of the GDP, gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), has been contracting for three consecutive quarters now. A comparison of capacity utilisation levels with GFCF shows why. Capacity utilisation levels in industry have been significantly lower since the last decade. They touched an all-time low in December 2019, the latest period for which data is available. Investment demand follows capacity utilisation levels. Firms will only invest if they can utilise the existing capacity. The trend in the last few years shows that businesses did try to invest even when capacity utilisation levels were low. Such investments have proved to be unwise. Demand did not grow and capacity utilization levels plummeted further. The fact that core (non-food, non-fuel) inflation has been slowing during this period, suggests that even with falling capacity utilisation, there is no scarcity of goods in the market. (See Chart 2)   That misplaced optimism in investing might have extracted a cost from companies. In a paper published in March in the Economic and Political Weekly, Zico Dasgupta from Azim Premji University has highlighted the deteriorating financial health of Indian companies. Dasgupta used the Centre for Monitoring Economy’s Prowess database to calculate interest coverage ratio (ICR) for India’s non-financial firms. ICR is the ratio of a company’s profits and interest payments. If profits are not enough to even cover interest payments, ICR falls below one. In December 2019, this ratio was less than one for almost a fourth of India’s listed non-financial firms. The corresponding proportion, till March 2013, was less than 10%. The paper argues that the current policy regime has been trying to relax the solvency condition of firms through various measures such as corporate tax cuts and interest rate reductions. Meanwhile, consumer sentiment seems to be weakening, dragging down demand. RBI’s consumer confidence surveys show that current perceptions on income and non-essential spending have collapsed in the recent period. (See Chart 3)  "
" With countries under a global lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, and dealing with its outbreak and spread, the one positive quotient that seems to have emerged out of this situation is that it’s helped the environment become better. Pollution levels have exponentially reduced, the air has become cleaner, and there’s more consciousness about the way forward in everyone’s minds. After all, it’s when we take care of the environment around us, that it shall take care of us in return and benefit us. World Environment Day is celebrated every year on June 5 to remind people that we should not take nature for granted. The theme for World Environment Day 2020 is ‘Celebrate Biodiversity’ which shall be hosted in Colombia, in partnership with Germany. The theme is a relevant one in the current scenario because human beings need other living beings to survive and co-exist as biodiversity is important for everyone. On World Environment Day today, a new book tells the stories of 10 Indian conservationists who are striving to solve the most pressing problems on the planet - from climate change to habitat degradation, and from food insecurity to species loss, often facing seemingly insurmountable odds. Authors Bijal Vachharajani and Radha Rangarajan say their book “10 Indian Champions Who are Fighting to Save the Planet” is being published at a time when the world is overheated, and globally, temperatures are rising steadily - the carbon in the atmosphere has crossed 415 parts per million (350 ppm is a safe level), and a million species are at risk of going the dodo way. The authors say when they started work on the book, they were filled with dread at the prospect of picking only 10 people. “We made lists, scratched out the lists, re-did the lists and made more lists. Our first list had the great stalwarts of environment and wildlife, yesterday’s and today’s - Salim Ali, Indira Gandhi, J Vijaya, Shehla Masood, M Krishnan, Anupam Mishra, Zafar Futehally, Bittu Sahgal.” But then they realised they wanted to talk about today and tomorrow, the problems and the solutions and meet these everyday heroes, both young and old. “So we set out to conduct interviews - we travelled to Tamil Nadu to meet Romulus Whitaker; we drank copious cups of coffee with Kavitha Kuruganti and Aparajita Datta in Bengaluru; sneaked out of an elephant fest in Delhi to talk to Jay Mazoomdaar,” they say. Vachharajani and Rangarajan want this book to establish that the environment is not the other - “it’s a dynamic part of each of us, and we are a part of the environment”. Talking about her experience of writing the book, Vachharajani says it was an “adventure, where we got to talk to some amazing nature defenders and listen to them”. Rangarajan adds, “We are in the middle of a pandemic, while already being deep in a climate crisis - both of which have been caused by our excessive meddling with the environment. Every expert we spoke to made us hyper-aware of the fact that they still continue to learn new things from nature.” -- with agency inputs"
" In living memory, never perhaps has there been a time where truly the entire world has shut down and is struggling to grapple with health, political, economic, social, cultural and environmental turmoil all at the same time. 2020 has not been an easy year so far. Covid-19 has both divided and united the world simultaneously and at large. Among other challenges, climate change looms over us with frequent reminders of nature’s imbalance whilst prompting us to rethink about the way we live. Data points are staggering; value chains disrupted in ways we do not know yet; and, what we took for granted seems like a distant luxury now. We find ourselves as reluctant actors in a dystopian movie plot where fact and fiction are blurred and every day our resilience is tested against a background score of consistent uncertainty. In all likelihood, ongoing events and those leading up to them will have a far-reaching impact on all of us. We may see the following responses to shape our resilience. The emergence of the home as a sanctuary: Lockdowns world over have confined us to our homes as the centre of our lives. Ownership, location, proximity, form, function, arrangement/sequence, adaptability, flexibility, planning, design and development will all undergo significant changes. Change in planning and design of different asset classes: Most other asset classes will see a change in some format owing to new ways of living, working, learning, shopping, eating/drinking and playing among others to adapt to changes and the emergence of new demographics thrown up against the current scenario. Decentralisation of downtown: While this was already underway, it may be expedited as more people work from home and the need for physical concentration and density of work creation at key locations becomes less prevalent. More Mixed-Use and Mixed-Income self-sufficient neighbourhoods: Smaller home/residential centred mixed-use and mixed-income communities may come up to ensure for self-sustenance and provide for equitable opportunities from a socio-economic standpoint. Importance of Transit-Oriented Development: While travel comes back to normal and the need for travel may see some change; transit and transit-oriented development would become important to ensure 3 and 4 above in shaping our cities as more equitable working engines of growth and opportunity. The emergence of new asset classes and their combinations: In the pervasive sharing economy, we have already seen the emergence of co-working spaces. We may see more such trends in living, retail, hospitality, industrial and other sectors. From a design and planning standpoint, and owing to the current scenario, we are already seeing combinations between health/wellness and other sectors. Experience of merging virtual and physical spaces: By effectively creating an alternative to real commuting with telecommuting we would see more focus on the design, planning and management of spaces that overlap between physical and virtual worlds to create optimum experiences across sectors. Need for flexible spaces: Design and planning of spaces would need to effectively cater to individual isolation/communal use; multiuse adaptation; scaling; physical/virtual use and experience and change. Use of new and improved technology: From due diligence, estimating use/usability and generating a brief using big data, design/planning tools, customer interface, marketing/sales digitisation, contracting, use of smart materials, prefabricated/pre-engineered construction/delivery, automation, sensing, measurement and lifecycle use – ‘Prop Tech’ may emerge as a new discipline and ecosystem. Focus on sustainability, health and wellness: This is the primary reason for our resilience It is our responsibility to ensure triple bottom line sustainability as individuals and as a collective to not only repair our planet but make all necessary changes that will reverse the impact of climate change in setting up our environment for a healthier future. Our resilience and transformation may not just be limited to trends alone, but in truly evolving the way we live, learn, work, play, eat, drink and socialise. These difficult times are teaching us what is important and for the right reasons. They are reminding us of what we do not want with clear insight into what a brighter future could be.  "
" In the last two months since lockdown was imposed in the country, pollution levels have indeed gone down and one can breathe the fresh air, but Bhumi Pednekar has a word of caution. While the actor, also a climate activist hopes that people have learnt the lesson, she feels there’s still a long way to go. “We’ve to understand that the two months of global lockdown is not the solution. People think ki ‘arrey wah, abhi air pollution kam ho gaya, sab accha ho gaya’. We’ve to continue on this path, so that our planet gets a chance to recover,” says Pednekar, adding that this has been a great awakening in all ways. “People have had the time to introspect and understand that there is no planet B. This is the only world we have and it’s our only chance at survival,” she says.  This week is going to be full of surprises and tons of fun as #ClimateWarrior celebrates #WorldEnvironmentDay :) We are kick-starting it with what is your #OneWishForTheEarth ? I have my friends and peers from the industry who have been kind enough to share their wish. So, if you have #OneWishForTheEarth (or more), share it with me. We will also be celebrating eco-friendly and sustainable #smallbusinesses and be in conversation with our little Climate Warriors from the ages of 4 to 8yrs.. they are just so cute ♥️ Also, a special mention to a very special launch (stay tuned to find out more 🤓). The sole effort put behind all of these activities has been a joy-ride and a learning process for me. I look forward to creating more and more awareness about the environment and our natural surroundings by learning to co-exist. Lots and lots of love, Climate Warrior (Bhumi) A post shared by Bhumi✨ (@bhumipednekar) on Jun 1, 2020 at 11:24pm PDT Insisting on the need for every individual to take note of the gravity of the situation, the actor, 30, is all about adopting habits. “We may think what difference will one person’s habit make, but it does matter. In the last 40 years that things have gone out of control, it has taken one generation to do all the damage, and it’s going to take a lot longer than that to heal our planet, “says the actor, who through her initiative, Climate Warrior, is urging people to share their ‘One Wish for The Earth’. The Saand Ki Aankh actor feels that the action to save the environment can be as small as not wasting water at home, saving electricity, not taking long baths and banishing single use plastic. She explains, “It’s about making smart choices. Especially the urban class is the biggest abuser of the natural resources. We really need to get our act together. Recycle is one and also avoid food wastage, which is the one of the biggest contributors to climate change. We’re producing more food than out planet can support, and we still have countries that are hungry.”  I am eternally grateful and thankful to you @akshaykumar sir, for sharing your #OneWishForTheEarth! Thank you for putting out such a strong message :) I pray and hope we all become aware and work towards a greener future. #ClimateWarrior A post shared by Bhumi✨ (@bhumipednekar) on Jun 2, 2020 at 1:37am PDT Pednekar also urges people to not just do it for the future generations, but for their own future as well. “I want to grow old in a surrounding that’s fulfilled. I want to go out for a walk after I retire, breathe in clean air and have clean water. It’s my basic right,” she asserts. However, she fails to understand how humans feel that they’re so invincible and think they’ll survive “without water food or clean air to breathe”. Raising awareness is the key, Pednekar points, and adds, “We can bring about a change when we talk about it. We have policy makers. In India, we’re fortunate that we’re working towards green business, developing renewable energy, celebrating going green or blue with our infrastructure.”"
" On the eve of World Environment Day, actor Arjun Kapoor on Thursday shared his ‘One Wish For The Earth’ as a move to fight climate change, reduce the use of plastic in day to day life. The Panipat actor is the latest name to join the list of celebrities, who have come forward to support Bhumi Pednekar’s initiative ‘Climate Warrior,’ which endeavours to get leaders from the entertainment industry to tell what is the ‘one wish they have for the earth.’   This #WorldEnvironmentDay, my #OneWishForTheEarth is we curb using plastic and help protect planet Earth. Let's all become more conscious of our actions and be #ClimateWarriors! Thanks @bhumipednekar for spreading awareness on climate conservation 😊 🌍 A post shared by Arjun Kapoor (@arjunkapoor) on Jun 4, 2020 at 4:28am PDT Kapoor put out a video message on Instagram in support of the campaign and shared his wish of reducing the use of plastic that causes hazardous of bad effect on the environment. “The only thing that came to my mind is ... let’s reduce the use of plastic on a day to day basis. We have already caused a lot of harm unknowingly and knowingly in some cases,” said the 34-year-old actor as he explained how our marine lives are also being affected by the plastic use.

" The severe cyclonic storm which made landfall south of Alibag in Maharashtra’s Raigad district on Wednesday at 11.30 am is an indication of an increasing frequency of severe cyclones developing in Arabian Sea in the past decade, a trend that studies have linked to climate change. In the past two years, there have been seven cyclones in the Arabian Sea, though, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD), the ratio of cyclones in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal — which just witnessed the destructive cyclone Amphan on May 21 — is 1:4. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) last year came out with a special report, Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, in which it said that extreme rainfall and extreme sea level events associated with some tropical cyclones are being seen to have a cascading impact on coastal areas. “There is emerging evidence for an increase in annual global proportion of Category 4 or 5 tropical cyclones in recent decades,” the IPCC report had said. A category 4 cyclone has a wind speed of 209-251 kmph, and is referred to as an extremely severe cyclonic storm, while a category 5 cyclone has a wind speed of more than 252 kmph, and is referred to as a super cyclone. The IPCC report refers to a 2017 study led by Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program, Princeton University, USA, which found that in 2014 and 2015, post-monsoon extremely severe cyclonic storms (ESCS) were first observed over the Arabian Sea causing widespread damage. The study had concluded that climate change had led to an increase in the occurrence of ESCSs in the Arabian Sea. “The effect of climate change on Cyclone Nisarga, my answer is “uncertain”. Our research suggests that cyclones would be more frequent during the post monsoon season (October-December) by a series climate model simulations. However, we didn’t find any significant changes in cyclone activity during the pre-monsoon (April-June) season through the climate simulations. It is very difficult to identify if a cyclone (like Nisarga) is generated in line with climate change,” said Hiroyuki Murakami, Project Scientist, University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. Murakami is the lead author of the study."

" Mankind can find solutions for future pandemics in conservation of biodiversity, which simply means conserving the gene pool of all things living, for posterity. Gene pools can be classified into possible usages like fighting pandemics, fighting hunger, fighting garbage in our cities, in landfills and in oceans, fighting air pollution, and above all, fighting climate change. The story of human civilization is one of harnessing biodiversity to its advantage. All crops were derived from wild plants. All domesticated animals were hybridized variants of their wild cousins. Almost all medicines owe their origin to nature. This diversity of living beings and diversity of ecosystems within which they flourish (oceans, deserts, mountains etc) make up for overall biodiversity. The vast numbers of different kinds of living organisms that make up Earth’s biodiversity are a result of three-and-a-half billion years of evolution. Benefits of biodiversity are measured in terms of ecosystem services. It is believed that value of ecosystem services is significantly larger than global GDP of all countries. An example of ecosystem services would be the service of pollination of plants provided by bees. Just imagine if there were no bees, what it would take to pollinate the plants across the world, manually! But like everything good, biodiversity too could be under threat. There have been five major mass extinctions, owing to cataclysmic changes in the environment. Some experts believe that we are now headed for a sixth mass extinction. This one will be caused by loss of habitat. India is ranked high among the countries with greatest degree of biodiversity (it has about 7% of the global faunal and about 10% of the global floral total species), and we, therefore, have most to lose – unless we take effective collective action now, to save humanity, to save the world, to save our children and our future generations. We need collective action across individuals, families, communities, nations to save biodiversity. We must conserve forests and associated biodiversity, and work towards achieving the common goal of having 33% of India’s land under forest cover. If the human race has to survive, all other life forms must survive to support the web of life. Human race has the ability to decide the future of itself and future of other life forms. Thousands of years ago, great thinkers of India contemplated the same and came up with a universal maxim of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ which means the universe is my family. Let us trust that all solutions are within nature (biodiversity), and we promise to protect our common future."
                  
" Climate disasters this year, including Cyclone Amphan expected to hit India’s eastern coast on Wednesday, are likely to compound the problems related to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic since 2020 is also likely to be the warmest on record, a paper published on May 15 in British Nature journal has warned. There is a 74.67% chance of 2020 being the warmest year ever and a 99.94% chance that it will among the top five warmest years, the American National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in March. The paper by Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientists and students has listed heat waves in north India, floods in the delta regions of West Bengal and Bangladesh, wildfires in Siberia, bushfires in Australia, locust crises, drought, water scarcity and floods in Africa, a hurricane in the US among others as climate-attributable risks. The risks are likely to intersect with the Covid-19 crisis over the next 12 to 18 months. “A concerning body of evidence already indicates that climate hazards, which are increasing in frequency and intensity under climate change, are likely to intersect with the Covid-19 outbreak and public health response. These compound risks will exacerbate and be exacerbated by the unfolding economic crisis and long-standing socioeconomic and racial disparities, both within countries and across regions,” said the paper. Fiji was hit by a category 5 tropical cyclone Harold in April. The Gulf Coast of the US is bracing for hurricane season while Louisiana has become the Covid-19 mortality hotspot. In South Africa, authorities are struggling to maintain social distancing during flooding in informal settlements. Drought in Zimbabwe has left millions without access to clean water, the paper said. The paper warned extreme heat events in the US and outside are likely to lead to excess mortality and morbidity, disrupt power supplies, hospitals and emergency services, especially in cities. Emergency response agencies and first responders will have to be deployed across multiple crises at the same time. For example, American Federal Emergency Management Agency is coordinating Covid-19 as well as ongoing extreme weather responses. India’s National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) is faced with similar dual responsibilities including rescue and evacuation efforts related to Amphan. “Cyclone Amphan is very intense and has the potential to do large-scale damage. It is a big challenge as the cyclone is striking during the outbreak of Covid-19. We [NDRF] are facing two disasters. It a cyclone in the time of Covid-19,” NDRF chief SN Pradhan said. The paper has recommended coordination at every level of government to prevent potential conflicts of strategy across agencies as difficult policy decisions may lie ahead, including whether hospitals, especially intensive care units, can be evacuated safely. It has also recommended policies on managing health risks during large scale evacuation or sheltering. Detailed plans need to be drafted for compound risk preparedness and governments need to ensure continuous electricity and water supply to avoid an increase in transmission of Covid 19, it said. The paper said overall a long-term strategy for pandemic preparedness is also needed. “...Covid-19 is neither the first nor only time that our globalized society will face these types of compound risks; for example, Puerto Rico was forced to stop Zika surveillance and response in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria [2017].” Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, said while they were preparing the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports, they realised that the worst-case scenarios are the compound climate events, where multiple extreme events overlap. “For example, floods due to extreme rains and the high tide coming together when the sea level is also high. Or where the warming in the tropical oceans are making it much more fertile in terms of cyclonic activities and intense storm surges [cyclone Amphan is the best example],” said Koll. Koll added even developed nations are not well equipped to mitigate such kind of compound events."
" The coronavirus pandemic threatens to derail any progress made in recent years to deal with the climate change crisis, organizers of the annual gathering of business and political elites in the Swiss ski resort of Davos said Tuesday. In a survey of industry professionals that reassesses the risks to the global outlook in light of the pandemic, the World Economic Forum said “years of progress” on addressing climate change could be undone and that it is important for countries to make sure environmental issues are at the heart of recovery plans. “We now have a unique opportunity to use this crisis to do things differently and build back better economies that are more sustainable, resilient and inclusive.” said Saadia Zahidi, the WEF’s managing director. The WEF warned that “omitting sustainability criteria in recovery efforts or returning to an emissions-intensive global economy risks hampering the climate resilient low-carbon transition.” At the most recent gathering in Davos in January, climate issues dominated the week’s discussions and many companies, as well as national governments, insisted that dealing with global warming would be central to their programs over the coming years. Spurred on by young climate activists, such as Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate, promises were made to meet the commitments made in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Since then, though, everything has been upended by the coronavirus, which has forced much of the world to impose unprecedented lockdowns of their societies. The economic damage and the difficulties involved in lifting the restrictions are having a colossal economic impact, with tens of millions of people around the world losing their jobs and many countries facing potentially the deepest recessions since World War II."
" Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, after a three-month-long break from all engagements since the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, began two-day virtual teaching on Saturday on tackling negative emotions of fear and anxiety precipitated by the global health crisis. Drawing from the teachings of Buddhist scholar, Nagarjuna in his text, ‘Precious Garland’, he said the analytical and scientific approach of the Nalanda tradition, forming the base for Tibetan Buddhism, is precise in the study of the workings of human mind, according to a post on the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA). He compared it to quantum physics that makes a distinction between appearance and reality. “Appearance can be misleading, an object can be dissected into the tiniest molecule. While inherently the object holds no fixed meaning, we as observers ascribe meaning to the object. Therefore, we should instead seek an objective reality”. His Holiness observed how materialistic development with its comfort and ease has brought along the human ignorance towards inner peace, so much that even materially successful people feel discontent.

Photo by Ven Tenzin Jamphel #dalailama A post shared by Dalai Lama (@dalailama) on May 16, 2020 at 2:13am PDT The antidote to this discontent is the understanding that mental and emotional wellbeing is central to self-confidence and happiness. Tibetan Buddhist philosophy espouses the transformation of mind as the key to achieving peace and happiness within oneself and in the world at large. Especially relevant in the present circumstances, the spiritual leader spoke on the interdependence of all living beings -- “an individual is reliant on community to survive which teaches us to strive for kindness and compassion towards one another, qualities intrinsic to human nature.” Similarly in the COVID-19 crisis that the world is facing today, the Nobel Peace laureate stressed global cooperation and focus on “what unites us as members of one human family”. In this vein, he called upon all citizens of the world to also pay attention to the long-term issue of global climate change that has been set in motion and are expected to have far-reaching consequences within the next two decades.

" In Venice, a city famous for being visited by too many and home to too few, children’s play now fills neighborhood squares, fishermen sell their catch to home cooks, and water buses convey masked and gloved commuters to businesses preparing to reopen. At the same time, the famed lacquered black gondolas remain moored to the quay; hotel rooms are empty, museum doors sealed; and St. Mark’s Square — normally teeming in any season — is traversed at any given moment by just a handful of souls after tourists abandoned the city in late February. For years, Venice has faced an almost existential crisis, as the unbridled success of its tourism industry threatened to ruin the things that have drawn visitors for centuries. Now the coronavirus pandemic has dammed off the tide of tourists and hobbled the city’s economy. Residents hope the crisis has also provided an opportunity to reimagine one of the world’s most fragile cities, creating a more sustainable tourism industry and attracting more full-time residents. The pandemic — following on the heels of a series of exceptional floods in November that dealt a first economic blow — ground to a halt Italy’s most-visited city, stanching the flow of 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion) in annual tourism-related revenue, the vast majority of the city’s intake. Promised government assistance has been predictably slow to arrive. The city that has inspired painters like Canaletto and Turner is now a blank canvas. “This allows us to rethink life in the historic center,” said Mayor Luigi Brugnaro, speaking in the empty piazza in front of St. Mark’s Basilica this week. The population of the historic center has shrunk to some 53,000, down by one-third from a generation ago. To help repopulate the center, Brugnaro favors a proposal from the city’s Ca’ Foscari university to rent to students apartments that had been removed from housing stock as tourist rentals. The mayor imagines a dynamic he witnessed in Boston, where those who come to study fall in love with the city and stay. Brugnaro also wants to create a center to study climate change, given the city’s vulnerability to flooding, that could attract scientists who would become residents. He imagines triggering a sort of Renaissance that would bring other foreign residents — creatives — who for centuries were the city’s lifeblood. He would like to resize the hit-and-run mass tourism on which the economy depends. “Venice is a slow city,” Brugnaro said. “The slowness of Venice is the beauty of Venice.” Visions for Venice’s future include calls to offer tax breaks to bring traditional manufacturing back to the historic center. Civic groups have suggested incentives to restore traditional ways of Venetian life, like the standing rowboats used for centuries by residents but that struggle to compete with motorized boats. There is hope that tourist trap shops that disappeared after the shutdown will be replaced with more sustainable businesses. Bevilacqua — the maker of luxury textiles used by fashion houses such as Dior, Valentino and Dolce&Gabbana — is the only manufacturer in operation on the Grand Canal. “To relaunch, Venice must return to its past,” said Rodolfo Bevilacqua. “You cannot, and I will use a heavy term, profane it daily. That is, people who don’t clean up after themselves.” While the pandemic has offered a glimpse at a cleaner, slower Venice, already there are signs of how hard it will be to maintain that, let alone implement grander plans. Jane da Mosto, executive director of the NGO We Are Here Venice, notes that bars that have begun to reopen are serving with disposable plates and cutlery — not more sustainable alternatives. Debates over how to manage tourism have always been heated in Venice and are especially fraught now. Venice’s controversial plan to impose a tax on day-trippers has been put aside — and many object that any such system would give the city even more of a theme park air. The mayor and tourism officials estimate it will be at least a year until tourists — who have numbered 30 million a year — return in any significant numbers. While many are reveling in the drop in noise pollution and improved air quality, a year without tourists also means many jobs will be wiped out. “It will be a fight for survival,” said Claudio Scarpa, the head of the Venetian hotel association. The docking of cruise ships is halted for this year. Gondoliers aren’t being permitted to glide through the canals until June 1, and many are struggling, having received just one payment of 600 euros from the government. Their future even after that date remains uncertain. The gondolier’s position at the rear of the boat allows enough distance to spare them the mask requirement. But Andrea Balbi, the head of the association representing the city’s 433 gondoliers, said that the rules so far won’t permit them to help tourists on and off the rocky boats. The extended hand is not just a courtesy, Balbi said, but a condition of insurance coverage. Arrigo Cipriani, the owner of Harry’s Bar, said he is not even thinking about opening the wood-paneled, canal-side bar made famous by Ernest Hemingway until health restrictions are relaxed. His bar offers some of the best people-watching in Venice over peachy Bellini cocktails — but it is just 9½ meters by 4 meters (30 feet by 13 feet), which under current rules would allow only a fraction of the usual clientele. “Hospitality means freedom. It means an absence of imposition,” Cipriani said — and doesn’t happen over a mask. Nearby, the Hotel Saturnia is spacing out its bar tables to reopen next Monday. “We want to send a positive message,” said owner Gianni Serandrei. Brugnaro, the mayor, is hoping to send a signal of recovery by staging the popular Redeemer’s festival in July. The annual event celebrates the end of the plague in 1577 — one of the most disastrous episodes in Venetian history — with a regatta and a spectacular fireworks display. “It will be something out of this world to see,” he said, “watching from a boat in St. Mark’s Basin.” (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.)"
      
" On May 12, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a ₹20 lakh crore economic package to overcome the current distress and the devastating impact of the lockdown on individuals and businesses, encourage domestic industry, attract investments, and create what he called a “self-reliant India”. The PM also indicated that the government will undertake deeper structural reforms, across land, labour, and laws. To use this moment to reset Indian institutions and economy to ensure both prosperity and equity is, in principle, a laudable goal. While undertaking the reform process, however, India’s fragile environment must not become a casualty. India’s development path shows that there is a good chance of this happening because successive governments have veered towards the view that stringent environment protection laws hamper economic development. This is a false binary. Speedy clearances of projects without proper regulatory and impact assessment may secure investments from the market and finances from banks in the short-term, but their long-term effects can scar the economy and people. Unfortunately, the ministry of environment, forest and climate change’s new draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA), released in March, also seems to reflect the development versus environment outlook. The EIA is a process of evaluating the impact of a proposed project or development on ecology and humans. Instead of strengthening the process, the draft EIA, experts believe, is diluting the regulatory process for projects; sets severe limits to the quality of project appraisal; gives exemptions to more sectors from public hearing (where project-affected people can raise their concerns), and allows lenient monitoring and compliance protocols."
" Millions of people living in coastal areas would be at risk if global temperatures were to rise by another 3.5 degrees Celsius, causing sea-levels to rise by an additional four feet by the end of this century and 16 feet by the year 2300, according to a recent study. The rise in sea-levels “would expose up to hundreds of millions of people to coastal flooding and devastate coastal ecosystems,” according to the authors of the study published in the journal Climate and Atmospheric Science. If the new estimates of rise in sea-level were to come true, it could affect around 770 million people or about 10% of the world’s population that lives less than 16 feet or five metres above sea level, The Sun reported. “A global sea-level rise by several metres would be detrimental for many coastal cities such as Miami, New York, Alexandria, Venice, Bangkok, just to name a few well-known examples. Some may have to be abandoned altogether as they cannot be defended,” the co-author of the study Stefan Rahmstorf, was quoted as saying in an article in The Guardian. Also Read: Sea level could rise 10 times faster by 2100; Mumbai at risk, says study The study aggregates the views of 106 experts who were chosen because they have published at least six peer-reviewed papers on the subject in major academic journals. The prediction for year 2300 is based on the fact that rising temperatures will cause ice sheets covering West Antarctica and Greenland to shed trillions of tonnes in mass. The rise in sea-level could be avoided if countries fulfilled their 2015 Paris Climate agreement promises to cut emissions of the gases that are heating the planet, the authors said, reports The Guardian. The Paris Climate treaty aims at capping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius."
" With little access to air conditioners or parks during the coronavirus lockdown, India’s poor - from farmers to slum-dwellers - could face deadly threats from heat waves this summer, climate and disaster management experts have warned. Crippling heat waves, drought and water scarcity usually grip India during the summer months of May and June. Authorities regularly issue advisories on how to keep cool, including advice to drink water frequently, find shady spots and use fans. But following that advice could be more difficult this year with most of the country’s 1.3 billion people trapped indoors as a result of a lockdown to try to stem spread of the coronavirus. Conditions will be particularly harsh for the poor living in small, cramped homes with no air conditioners, little ventilation and irregular water and power supplies. “Vulnerable communities are on the front lines of crises ranging from extreme heat (and) climate change to COVID-19,” said Anjali Jaiswal of the U.S.-based Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). “The risks of extreme heat are deadly. Heat is not merely an inconvenience, it kills,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in emailed comments. India’s virus lockdown - enforced beginning March 25 - quickly prompted tens of thousands of poor migrant workers to walk hundreds of miles back to their home villages in blazing heat, with scores falling ill or dying along the way. The past decade has been India’s hottest on record, with extreme heat directly killing about 350 people last year, according to the national weather office. Temperatures so far this year have hit 41 degrees Celsius (105 Fahrenheit) in New Delhi. Parts of the western desert state of Rajasthan have recorded temperatures of nearly 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in recent weeks. Overall, the Indian Meteorological Department has predicted a warmer-than-usual summer between April and June. The forecast prompted the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) last month to issue special advice for dealing with heat waves during the lockdown. It created lists of guidelines for workers ranging from vegetable vendors to farm and construction labourers, police and traffic officers. For example, it advised employers to schedule strenuous jobs at cooler times of the day, and to increase the frequency and duration of rest breaks for outdoor work - all while employees wear masks and maintain social distancing. Anup Kumar Srivastava, a drought and heat wave expert at the NDMA, said the agency was working not only to contain COVID-19, but also to save people from the “increasing intensity and severity of heat waves”. High temperatures can cause dehydration, heat exhaustion and heat stroke, and worsen chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. He said people who suffer such heat-related illnesses could be a challenge for overstretched hospitals already “struggling to cope” with more than 67,000 coronavirus infections. Srivastava urged states to launch COVID-19 specific heat action plans to “reduce the adverse effects of heat waves”. “Since the majority of the people will be staying at home due to lockdown, ensuring power and water supply during peak heat days will be the priority,” he said. LIMITED OPTIONS Huge parts of India already endure a scorching, sometimes deadly, summer, and climate experts say the country is particularly at risk as global heat records are set year after year. As extreme heat and humidity increase across the globe, they threaten economies and millions of lives in places where it could become fatal to work outdoors, in some cases by 2060, scientists said in a study published last week. India already recorded over 2,000 deaths during a 2015 heat wave. A similar one in the western city of Ahmedabad in 2010 killed more than 1,300 and prompted the creation of South Asia’s first heat action plan in 2013. That plan included early warning text messages to mobile phones, use of public temperature displays and things like broader use of “cool roofs” with reflective surfaces or coatings to reduce temperatures in low-income and informal housing. Since its launch, the plan has helped prevent an estimated 1,100 deaths each year in Ahmedabad, according to a study published in the Journal of Environmental and Public Health in 2018. More than 20 of India’s 29 states, including eastern Odisha and Bihar, and 100 cities now have or are in the process of enforcing such plans, according to the NRDC, which helped develop the pioneering effort in Ahmedabad. Cities often face the worst temperatures as heat is reflected off paved surfaces, and because of a lack of trees in some areas, climate experts say. To beat furnace-like conditions, many people seek respite in air-conditioned public buildings, shops and malls, temples, parks, gardens or under trees - areas known as “cooling spaces” in the heat action plans. But this year many people will not have access to those spaces, experts warn. Instead they will need simply to drink plenty of water, wear light clothing and stay indoors, said Jaiswal of the NRDC. Shloka Nath, head of sustainability at Mumbai-based charitable foundation Tata Trusts, said cities need to invest in everything from more cool, green roofs to better ventilation in low-cost housing to deal with growing long-term heat risks. “Longer, hotter and deadlier summers are poised to become the norm due to climate change,” she said. “Given the current COVID-19 crisis ... reducing heat-related exposure is key.” (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

" India’s CO2 emissions fell by around 1% in the financial year ending March 2020, which is the first year-on-year reduction recorded since 1982, according to a Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) . The analysis is based on India’s financial year 2019-20 fossil fuel generation and consumption data including coal and oil. The country’s CO2 emissions fell by an estimated 15% during the month of March and are likely to have fallen 30% in April, the analysis published in CarbonBrief, a portal on climate and energy news on Tuesday said. Lower power demand growth and competition from renewable energy may have resulted in this reduction.       "
" The skies have got bluer, birds chirpier, forests breathing better and less food waste being generated due to restaurants closed – lockdown has automatically cleaned the environment. Do your bit for the nature and turn to a zero-waste living – from food to necessities. The goal is for no trash to be sent to landfills, incinerators, or the ocean. Urban planner Tanya Mukherjee who has been following a zero-waste lifestyle says, “Watch those trucks emptying the wastes. The scale is so shocking and you realize how tiny we are compared to the amount of waste we create. Minimalism is the route to achieve zero waste. And lockdown is the perfect time to adopt this. ” It also cuts down expenditure and makes us healthy. Environmentalist Ranju Minhas says, “If we have a healthy biodiversity, we’re healthy because we’re a part of the whole ecosystem.”   What is health? Yes, it is fitness of body and mind. Yes, this is achievable through regular physical exercise and healthy eating habits. But what i have learnt to understand over the years is good health is intrinsically connected to the health of the environment. Clean air, clean soil, clean seas, clean food and regular interaction in open spaces with nature. This leads to balance. This #WorldHealthDay i want to acknowledge our sanitation workers. They work in the most challenging conditions and are most often ignored and neglected by society. Especially during this time when they continue to work everyday to manage bio-medical waste and all the waste we continue to produce while we stay home. They are HEROES. @my_bmc Thinking of all these good people today 💚🌏 and offering them my gratitude. @pragyakapoor_ this is from our beach clean up activity on Republic Day. A post shared by Dia Mirza (@diamirzaofficial) on Apr 6, 2020 at 11:30pm PDT Start composting Eating well is good but even healthy foods can create a lot of waste harmful for the nature. “Micro manage your kitchen waste and convert the things you don’t need into compost,” says Minhas. Garbage gardening is an easy and inexpensive way to grow greens using kitchen waste – the seeds and roots that otherwise would be headed to a landfill. She adds, “It’s a fun way to recycle by using wheat bags, rice sacks, discarded bottles, old bath tubs, etc. Just drop in the seeds to the soil so they germinate.”   Had recorded this video for #WorldEnvironmentDay 2019. Time for a reminder. As we stay home, stay safe, we must consider the opportunity to make a big difference at this time! Segregation of waste and composting wet waste or kitchen waste (vegetable and fruit peels, left overs from pots, pans and plates, tea leaves, basically anything that grows from the Earth can go back to the Earth) as a daily practice is a wonderful contribution towards our society and environment. Consider this, our civic body continues to work to collect our waste and dispose of it responsibly even during this pandemic. Wouldn’t you want to take the opportunity to use this time at home and put into practice reducing the waste we create? This simple daily action will not only help reduce the burden on our civic workers but would also help combat air, land and sea pollution. If you require tips on how to compost kitchen waste go to @earthlingfirst to see the easy to implement ways to compost waste. Proud of my co-operative that we continue to segregate waste, this is our 4th year since we implemented this practice and it gives us joy! @my_bmc 🌏🙏🏻 #StayHome #StayHomeSaveLives #BeatPollution #BeatAirPollution #WasteManagement #CovidWarriors #CleanAir #CleanSeas #BreatheLife A post shared by Dia Mirza (@diamirzaofficial) on Apr 11, 2020 at 12:05am PDT Responsible consumption With everyone turning into master chefs during lockdown, the amount of organic waste going into the bins has increased. Now is the time to cook efficiently, limiting food scraps and wastage. Nutritionist Neeta Thapa says, “Each forkful of food is responsible for greenhouse gas emissions before reaching our plate. Processing, packaging and transporting the food contribute to climate change. When we throw, it rots and releases more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.” Read: Bollywood celebs pick a healthy hobby: Grow own fruits, veggies amid lockdown Nutritionist Abhishek gives some tips to reuse food waste. · Lemon and orange peels – While orange peels contains flavonoids and other phytochemicals beneficial for preventing cancer and heart diseases, lemon peels contain D-limonene that prevents cellular damage by fighting free radicals in your body. Make marmalade or pickle out of them or use it for seasoning by freezing and grating. · Bitter melon peels contains half the nutrient like charantine, vicine, and polypeptide which saves body from toxins. Eat it without scraping. · Eat your salad with the skins because it’s healthy. For example, cucumber skin is rich in vitamin K which support bone growth and blood clotting. · Turn overripe vegetables like cabbage into sauerkraut or kimchi. They are nutritious. · Rather than wasting squishy bananas and other overripe fruit, turn them into smoothie or jam or add them to cakes. Fruits are rich in fibre and contain nutrients such as potassium and vitamin C. Also eat raw fruits instead of juice for a healthy diet and less waste. · The non woody part of coriander stems can be used as dim sum sauce to add a nice flavor.   Ye dekho ..!!!

Reform, recycle and transform is the key! Minhas says, “First step to zero-waste lifestyle is thoughtful consumerism. Make sure you only buy products you use because a lot of natural resources, energy, man power, transportation cost is involved.” More than reusing products or DIY stuff, zero-waste lifestyle is all about patience. Development sector professional Himanshi Narula says, “Instead of plastic, I have a reusable bag, steel bottle, etc. I also make my own soaps, skin toners and facial and hair masks from wastes.” National Rurban Fellow Adarsh Tripathi who practices zero-waste lifestyle says, “Zero waste living isn’t about being perfect, and it’s about so much more than mason jars full of trash and reusables. Zero waste is about moving to a circular economy. I have experienced true contentment since starting this life and it has brought me more happiness.”"
" Inland waterways, hydroelectric projects up to 25 megawatts, small irrigation projects, some industrial parks or housing projects will only require an “environment permission” from authorities to begin construction under the new draft Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) notification, 2020. These projects’ environmental impacts will not be assessed in detail because they are believed to have a small environmental footprint, according to reviews of the draft by several researchers. On March 23, the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) had issued draft EIA notification 2020, which is expected to bring major changes in the way infrastructure projects such as industries, mines, large townships are granted environmental clearance and regulated. The EIA notification 2020, which will replace the EIA notification 2006, has been in the eye of a storm, as environmental groups and political leaders have been calling for debate and clarity on what these changes mean for the country’s fragile ecosystem. Kanchi Kohli and Manju Menon, both of whom specialise in infrastructure, ecology, and resource politics at the New Delhi-based Centre for Policy Research, have reviewed the new draft recently and shared their thoughts with HT. Edited excerpts from the interview: Is the draft EIA 2020 significantly different from EIA notification 2006? What do you make of this new draft? At first glance, it seems that the draft EIA 2020 is not very different from the EIA notification 2006. It appears that EIA 2020 only collates all the amendments, executive clarifications, and the court directions that were already in effect between 2006 and now. This draft puts it all together into one document. What makes this draft so unique is that this is the government’s thinking when our economy is crashing like never before because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. This draft creates a complacency that may be dangerous. It makes one feel like this is familiar and that things just got a bit worse. But that is the farthest thing from truth because all the assumptions that the EIA system is based on are under scrutiny now. We may not have too many major projects coming up due to recession. If projects do come up they may not have funds or may not want to invest in environmental safeguards and they may want resources handed to them cheaply so they can reap profits even during a recession. If this is a possibility we are looking at, should we not be thinking carefully before we put this EIA mechanism in place? The draft EIA 2020 has been notified at a time when there is a massive economic slowdown due to Covid-19. If notified, will EIA 2020 boost economic growth by simplifying processes for industries and infrastructure? Environmental approvals cannot boost the economy. Successive governments have propagated this myth by calling environmental approval procedures a hurdle. The ministry has made the frequency of approvals and ease of securing them as its target objective based on this misplaced logic. It keeps recirculating this false narrative of environment vs. development. Speedy approvals may, at best, help to secure investments from the market and finances from banks in the short term. At worst, if approvals are given to wrong projects, they can bring entire sectors, if not the whole economy crashing. We have examples of this in the 2014 Coalgate scandal and the Hydel-gate of the dams in the north-east. The real estate sector is also a good case in point. What does the draft EIA 2020 mean for India’s environment? How does it affect existing environmental standards? The draft has brought 43 sectors within its regulatory purview but it thins down the regulatory process for them. The draft lays out a six-step process and many definitions, giving the impression that there is an elaborate process of scrutiny in place before a project is approved. However, all this needs to be read with the range of exemptions and provisos. For instance, many projects would only require an Environmental Permission (EP) without detailed assessments or public hearings. The draft is also lenient towards expansion and “modernisation” projects that basically use more advanced technologies. For instance, all projects can enhance their capacity by 10% without any appraisals and only filing an online application. The draft proposes that the regulators take the project’s word for these aspects. The draft sets severe limits to the quality of project appraisal, increases the validity of the approval period, gives exemptions to more sectors from the public consultation, allows lenient monitoring and compliance protocols. These are all examples of lowering the standards of environmental regulation of projects. How does the draft EIA impact people? Does it have enough provisions for impacted communities to be heard? Common people have always been and continue to be peripheral to the EIA notification. The public hearing process has been in the notification since 1997, and it still remains with its form and purpose immensely watered down. For example, the EIA 2006 notification had reduced the scope of public hearings. No wonder, when people came to the hearing to speak about how profoundly the project would impact their resources, they simply ticked the procedural boxes. Yet, this public space is very important for all of us. As people, who may be affected by projects, we need information about the project, we need to know from its proponents why they think it’s a good idea to promote it and we need our views about it to be heard by all the stakeholders. This is a reasonable expectation to have in a democracy. Public hearings are still there in the notification but it has been contained a lot by reducing the notice period from 30 to 20 days and by exempting many projects from public hearings altogether. There is a clause in the draft that says that there should be ‘no postponement of date, time, venue of a public hearing’ unless some untoward emergency situation occurs and the postponement will be done only on the recommendations of the authorities concerned. There is a contentious provision in the draft on regularising EIA violations or projects, which have already come up without following due processes. What will be the impact of this provision? Can we expect more projects to violate? This is one of the more significant aspects of the draft EIA 2020. The clause is a big public admission from the government that the EIA system suffers from plenty of violations and this is systemic. This acknowledgment has come due to the hard work of many people and organisations, who have pointed out project violations, documented them, and taken them to task. It seems that the government is ready to admit that development projects have operated outside the framework of the law. So, whether this problem of rampant violations should be handled through statutory law or through government regulation? In this proposal, the government is trying to deal with violations like they are remediation projects."
" Actor Raveena Tandon has always been vocal about different issues, be it talking about climate change, or even requesting people to not abandon their pet animals in this coronavirus situation. And now, she has come up with a new initiative titled #JeetegaIndiaJeetengeHum on her Instagram handle. It aims at two things- one is to stop the spread of false rumours during these times, and the most critical, urging everyone to stop the violence and hatred being shown to them by different sections of the society, instead of applauding them. #♥️🙏🏻thankyou #medicalcommunity ♥️🙏🏻 I nominate @sonu_sood @theshilpashetty @thejohnabraham Friends,As we come together to fight the challenges posed by the Coronavirus Pandemic,I would like you to think of all those doctors, nurses and health-workers, quietly working with diligence and dignity,away from their homes and families,so that our present and future remains secure. Lately we have all heard unfortunate reports of our healthcare workers being harassed and attacked.This is a tragic happening we must all confront together. Please do not fall prey to fake news and false rumours, which may fuel violence against our medical community. The least we can do is to protect those who are doing everything to keep us safe and the one thing we owe them is a debt of gratitude.Thank you and stay safe!

Doctors and nurses are out there, our soldiers who are battling selflessly without caring for their lives. And then to see some ungrateful people attack them, spit on them, heave unruly, and throw stones and bricks at them… to see our doctors bleeding and going through this, and yet still fearlessly stepping out every day, disheartens me.”  She says what is even more saddening is that it’s “countrymen who are doing it to other countrymen.” The campaign is live on the 45-year-old’s Instagram handle. #stayhomestaysafe . It’s imperative we obey what our medical experts and our honourable CM is warning us of, two weeks more from 14 th has been extended already, but if we don’t take even this seriously then there are chances of a further lockdown. So please please people , think of yourselves your families and the worst economically affected in this unfortunate global crisis . #stayhomestaysafe ♥️ A post shared by Raveena Tandon (@officialraveenatandon) on Apr 11, 2020 at 10:22pm PDT We ask her further whether she has had first-hand experience with the rumours going around about the situation, which have the potential to create panic and chaos. Tandon says, “Unfortunately, a lot of these little bits of ignorance are playing their part, and people are falling prey to false news and rumours about what coronavirus is all about, how it is spreading, otherwise why would reasonable, thinking people start attacking the doctors who are out there to save them. They have been victims of some kind of brain washing or something. This needs to be rectified.

" In the pre-lockdown world, a typical birthday celebration for Tahir Raj Bhasin would mean having the company of his near and dear ones and gorging on delectable cakes of his choice. But since none of this will be technically possible as the world is practicing social distancing due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the actor is going to attempt it all virtually! The Chhichhore (2019) actor , who turns 33 today, says, “It’s unusual. It’s the one day in a year when I look forward to have a lot of friends and family over, and it’s also a cheat day in terms of eating all the cake you can, but unfortunately I am going to have to do it all via video calls. I have different friends in different parts of the country and world, and they’re all going to be doing a video call. And I’ll cut a cake with the family on a video call too.” Agreeing that technological advancement is the “silver lining” in these times, Bhasin adds, “It will be an unusual experience, but at least technology will connect all of us.” It is also something he’s totally tuned into to keep the prep going for his upcoming projects - whether it is analysing scenes more, rehearsing them more or getting to now the material better.

But even as everything is on a halt, Bhasin is looking at the positives. “This is not just one film or one industry. Every industry has been affected. The world is on a pause, and I feel it’s giving people time to breathe. Otherwise, we’d be jumping from one project to another. The only way to look at it is to try and find the positives in it, and try and come out of it stronger. That’s what my focus is at the moment,” adds the actor. In the post-lockdown phase, Bhasin feels there will be “more appreciation for people-to-people interaction”, “more consciousness in terms of interacting with the environment” as “up until now, climate change was always spoken about, but never before have we seen such a tangible impact on how messing with nature can affect humans”, and “health and sanitisation will be taken a lot more seriously”.  Week 2 meanderings. Do comment & tell me about the films / series you’re watching! Please Stay Indoors. #TogetherAtHome #SafeHands A post shared by Tahir Raj Bhasin (@tahirrajbhasin) on Mar 30, 2020 at 9:31pm PDT And while in this contemplative mood, one of these days, Bhasin also penned a poem, collating thoughts that he has been hearing and seeing in his neighbourhood. Explaining the sudden urge to write, he quips, “That’s the thing about being in self-isolation... that things that you didn’t have time for before or never even knew existed within you, start to crop up.” Ask him what’s the first thing he wants to do after the lockdown ends, Bhasin, whose parents are in Delhi, says, “One is to meet with the family as soon as possible. I haven’t seen them through most of this year. I have a younger brother who is currently in Hong Kong, and one doesn’t even know when he will be allowed back... and the second thing would be to get back on set and shoot as soon as possible, take a minute with the crew to appreciate what we have all gone through and be mindful of the fact that we’re coming back to create something.” These, he stresses, are “simple things we took for granted in a pre-lockdown world”, but these have become “valuable” now.

" Clear skies and more sunlight over Greenland last summer resulted in the biggest drop in the ice sheet’s mass ever recorded, new research shows. The phenomenon was linked to an exceptional high-pressure system that prevented the formation of clouds, according to a study led by Marco Tedesco from Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. That suggests climate models that don’t incorporate atmospheric data could be underestimating future melting by about half, Tedesco said in commentary accompanying the research. “These atmospheric conditions are becoming more and more frequent over the past few decades,” he said. “Simulations of future impacts are very likely underestimating the mass loss due to climate change.” Scientists closely monitor the surface mass balance of Greenland’s ice sheet—that is, how much mass is lost due to melting compared with how much is gained due to snowfall and other accumulation. But when there are no clouds, there’s no snow. As a result, about 50 billion fewer tons of snowfall fell over the ice sheet than average last year. Without the fresh snow cover, the ice absorbed more heat, eventually melting down to 320 billion tons below the average mass for 1981 to 2010, the biggest drop since record-keeping began in 1948. It gained back just 50 billion tons, about 13% of the average increase between 1981 and 2010.  Such a small increase is not good news said the study’s co-author, the University of Liege’s Xavier Fettweis, in commentary on the paper. That’s in part because surface mass losses aren’t the only way glaciers shrink. Fissures also form in the ice, causing large chunks to break off into the ocean, a process known as calving. Under stable conditions, the gains in surface mass balance would be high enough to compensate for the ice that’s lost when icebergs calve off, but not under current conditions. The same weather system caused a different damaging effect in the northern and western parts of Greenland. Warm, moist air from the lower altitudes gather there and formed clouds, but instead of bringing snowfall, these clouds trapped the heat that would normally bounce off of the ice into the atmosphere, creating a small-scale greenhouse effect. Overall, the Greenland ice sheet lost an estimated 600 billion tons in 2019, representing a sea level rise of about 1.5 millimeters. “You can see the mass balance in Greenland as your bank account,” Tedesco said. “In some periods you spend more, and in some periods you earn more. If you spend too much you go negative. This is what happened to Greenland.” (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

" Amid the coronavirus pandemic, climate change still demands global attention, which is why a green movement is sweeping the wine and spirits world. Did you know that synthetic bioluminescence from bacteria could make lighting in wineries more sustainable? Or that distillers can use solar power to create vodka out of thin air and water? These are among the surprising things I learned at a forum on wine and climate change at Vinexpo Paris in February, before social distancing became a way of life and air travel a memory. At the three-day Living Soils Forum sponsored by industry giant Moët Hennessy, we sat on benches crafted from used barrel staves in a huge space enclosed by recyclable cork walls, sipping wine and listening to international climate scientists, winemakers, and environmental consultants discuss the multibillion-dollar wine industry’s future. (Full disclosure: I spoke on a panel about organic certification). Naturally, it was also a way for the luxury drinks company to show off its eco-conscious credentials, which were more extensive than I realized. Chief Executive Officer Philippe Schaus announced that all the vineyards Moët Hennessy owns in Champagne will be free of herbicides by the end of 2020. This is a big deal, given that its brands produce millions of bottles of bubbly (even if other Champagne houses, such as grande marque Roederer, which makes Cristal, are ahead in embracing organic and biodynamic viticulture). Moët Hennessy is also investing €20 million ($21.8 million) in a new sustainability research center in the region, meant to explore everything from recycling water to lowering carbon emissions. Here are the highlights from the forum’s 15 panels. Biodiversity matters A post shared by château Anthonic (@chateau_anthonic) on Apr 9, 2020 at 3:44am PDT At the center of the new agriculture is “living soil” that’s high in organic matter to hold nutrients and water and with the microbial diversity to protect vines against pests and diseases, rather than relying on chemical pesticides and herbicides. Increasing organic matter by 1% can also more than double the water capacity of the soil. Fostering biodiversity is key to achieving this. Nicolas Blain of Reforest’Action in France insisted, “The forest is the future,” because forests are home to 80% of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity. Which is why Château Anthonic in Bordeaux is investing in agro-forestry, planting trees among the vines, as was done in the past. Rethinking packaging The next time you contemplate buying a super heavy bottle of wine, think again. Glass packaging and transportation of bottles account for about two-thirds of the wine industry’s carbon footprint.  Systembolaget, Sweden’s government-owned chain of liquor stores, has been encouraging wineries to use sustainable packaging, according to the chain’s purchasing manager Johan Lund. More than 50% of its sales are for box wines, much better for the environment from the perspectives of weight and carbon used in shipping—although the impact of introducing more plastic liners in place of recyclable glass raises other questions. Even luxury brands are becoming eco-conscious. While many Champagne brands come in heavy cardboard or wooden gift boxes, Ruinart will debut new eco-packaging later this year. Nine times lighter than a fancy box, it’s made of recyclable, textured, molded paper and fits tightly around a Ruinart bottle as if it were a stylish, elegant coat. Transforming Carbon Emissions A panel that featured creative ways to capture carbon dioxide emissions and transform them into usable products opened eyes.  One bottle of Air Co. vodka ($65) made in Brooklyn, N.Y., soaks up as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as eight fully grown trees—about a pound. The company says its use of solar power in its carbon capture machines makes Air Co. the world’s first carbon-negative distillery. The company is a finalist for the NRG Cosia Carbon Xprize of $20 million, explained Nikki Batchelor, the prize’s director of operations and impact. In other efforts, Bordeaux château Smith Haut Lafitte is capturing the CO2 released into the atmosphere during fermentation and turning it into baking soda used in its Michelin-starred restaurant. Adapting Isn’t an Option         "
       
" The world is going to experience a modest decline in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for the first time in 75 years but the dip is unlikely to result in any stabilisation in CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, which leads to climate change, experts said. The economic decline because of the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to give governments an idea of the magnitude of transformations needed in the coming decades to deal with climate change, scientists said. The impact of Covid-19 on CO2 emissions will be temporary and there is likely to be a strong rebound effect when governments try to make up for the economic slowdown after the pandemic gets over. CO2 emissions are likely to dip in March and April, as billions of people are in lockdown, including in the two most populous countries such as China and India. “We’ll definitely see a drop this year in CO2 pollution from fossil fuel use. How much of a decline depends on how long the lockdown lasts and how quickly economies recover. We could see a massive drop in emissions of 5% or more if the viral outbreak and economic downturn linger. You’d have to go back to World War II to see anything close to that big a decline. But note that a 5% decline does not mean concentrations will drop. We’d still be emitting 35 billion metric tonnes of fossil fuel pollution,” said Rob Jackson, chair, Global Carbon Project and Professor, Earth System Science at Stanford University in an e-mail response. He cautioned that the global economic crisis should worry us because “if the economy tanks, climate action may be delayed in the interest of getting people back to work. I hope we put people back to work in green energy and technology, sectors that will result in lasting change”. Many scientists have been worrying about this rebound. For instance, at Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii scientists are keeping a close watch on CO2 concentrations because this could be the first economic shock in several decades to slow the rise in concentrations. Ralph Keeling, professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, has estimated that global fossil fuel use will have to decline by 10% for a full year to show up CO2 concentrations. It would be a difference of only about 0.5 parts per million according to Climate Home, an independent climate news portal based on Keeling’s observations. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) had warned about this on March 24. “Any cuts in emissions as a result of the economic crisis triggered by Covid-19 are not a substitute for concerted climate action,” the WMO had said in a statement. “Past experience suggests that emission declines during economic crises are followed by a rapid upsurge. We need to change that trajectory,” WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas had said. Emissions represent what goes into the atmosphere while concentrations represent what remains in the atmosphere after the complex system of interactions between the atmosphere, biosphere, lithosphere, cryosphere and the oceans and CO2 remains in the atmosphere and oceans for centuries, the WMO explained. According to the Earth System Research Laboratory of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) the average CO2 concentrations in February were 414.11 parts per million (ppm) as compared to 411.75 ppm last year. The average for March has not been updated yet, but on March 29, 30 and 31, April 1 and 2 the concentrations ranged between 415. 60 and 415.81 ppm.      "
" The COP26 UN climate change conference scheduled to take place in Glasgow in November has been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic after a decision was taken during a ‘virtual meeting’ on Wednesday evening attended by UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was one of the leaders due to attend the meeting that will now take place in 2021, which will be hosted in Glasgow by the UK in partnership with Italy. The COP26 president-designate is business secretary Alok Sharma. The Scottish government announced this week that the SEC Arena, where COP26 was due to take place, will be turned into a field hospital to cope with coronavirus cases. Sharma said: “The world is currently facing an unprecedented global challenge and countries are rightly focusing their efforts on saving lives and fighting Covid-19. That is why we have decided to reschedule COP26”. “We will continue working tirelessly with our partners to deliver the ambition needed to tackle the climate crisis and I look forward to agreeing a new date for the conference”. Espinosa added: “Covid-19 is the most urgent threat facing humanity today, but we cannot forget that climate change is the biggest threat facing humanity over the long term. Soon, economies will restart”. “This is a chance for nations to recover better, to include the most vulnerable in those plans, and a chance to shape the 21st century economy in ways that are clean, green, healthy, just, safe and more resilient”. Several experts and officials involved with the Paris Agreement endorsed the postponement. Ajay Mathur, director-general of The Energy and Resource Institute, said: “The momentum for climate action has accelerated considerably, and we will have to ensure that this momentum is sustained even as CoP26 is moved to 2021”."
" Former US president Barack Obama took a veiled swipe Tuesday at his successor Donald Trump, chastising those who have “denied warnings” of a deadly coronavirus pandemic and cautioning against ignoring the consequences of climate change. The popular two-term Democrat took to social media as the Trump administration finalized a controversial rollback of Obama-era vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards that were aimed at slowing global warming. “We’ve seen all too terribly the consequences of those who denied warnings of a pandemic,” Obama posted on Twitter. “We can’t afford any more consequences of climate denial. All of us, especially young people, have to demand better of our government at every level and vote this fall.” The Republican leader’s government has faced stark criticism for failing to heed early global alarms about the virus outbreak, after death tolls began to spike in places like China and Italy. The United States now has more than 165,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, the most worldwide, and the US death toll has surged past 3,400 -- exceeding China’s official toll. Obama’s tweet included a link to a story about the Trump administration’s new rules. In a statement, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation were rolling back “costly, increasingly unachievable fuel economy and vehicle CO2 emissions standards.” The stringency of those so-called CAFE standards will now be increased by 1.5 percent annually through 2026, substantially less than the roughly 5.0 percent annual increases issued in 2012, the EPA said. So far, Obama has only rarely engaged in the 2020 presidential race, which features his former vice president Joe Biden as the Democrat likely to face Trump in November’s election."
" The Dalai Lama on Monday called for using “science and human ingenuity with determination and courage” to end the Covid-19 pandemic as he lauded the Indian government’s efforts to unite the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) states to overcome the crisis. The Tibetan spiritual leader, who has been based in India since 1959, issued a special message on the pandemic “in response to repeated requests from many people around the world”. “Today, we are passing through an exceptionally difficult time due to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic,” he said. “In addition to this, further problems confront humanity such as extreme climate change.” He added, “No matter how difficult the situation may be, we should employ science and human ingenuity with determination and courage to overcome the problems that confront us. Faced with threats to our health and well-being, it is natural to feel anxiety and fear.” He expressed his “admiration and gratitude to governments across the world, including the government of India, for the steps they are taking to meet these challenges”. The Dalai Lama, 84, noted everyone is doing their best to contain the spread of Covid-19 and said India’s efforts to forge a coordinated approach among members of the South Asian Association for Regional Countries (Saarc) will serve as “a model for dealing with such crises in future”. He said: “I applaud the concerted efforts of nations to limit the threat. In particular, I appreciate the initiative India has taken with other SAARC countries to set up an emergency fund and an electronic platform to exchange information, knowledge and expertise to tackle the spread of Covid-19.” The Dalai Lama said he took “great solace in the following wise advice to examine the problems before us: If there is something to be done—do it, without any need to worry; if there’s nothing to be done, worrying about it further will not help.” He said in the special message: “Ancient Indian tradition describes the creation, abiding and destruction of worlds over time. Among the causes of such destruction are armed conflict and disease, which seems to accord with what we are experiencing today. However, despite the enormous challenges we face, living beings, including humans, have shown a remarkable ability to survive.” While expressing understanding for lockdowns across the world, he said many people faced “tremendous hardship due to a loss of livelihood”. “For those with no stable income life is a daily struggle for survival. I earnestly appeal to all concerned to do everything possible to care for the vulnerable members of our communities,” he said. The Dalai Lama also offered special gratitude to medical staff, doctors, nurses and other support personnel “working on the frontline to save lives at great personal risk”. He added, “Their service is indeed compassion in action.”"
" Since 1993, World Water Day is being celebrated every year on March 22. According to the United Nations, the day aims to create awareness regarding the 2.2 billion people who are living without access to clean and safe water. A core focus of World Water Day is to support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 6: water and sanitation for all by 2030. History of World Water Day During the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, the General Assembly adopted a resolution by which March 22 was declared World Day for Water. The day was first celebrated in 1993. 2020 theme and significance The theme for World Water Day 2020 is ‘Water and Climate Change’. It explores how water and climate change are inextricably linked. The campaign by the UN aims to highlight on how sensible using of the natural resource can help minimize the possibility of floods, scarcity, droughts and pollution, and also fight climate change. The UN campaign of World Water Day 2020 is focusing on the importance of hand washing and hygiene as the world faces a crisis of gigantic proportions in the coronavirus pandemic. The campaign urges everyone to regularly wash their hands with water and soap or with an alcohol-based hand gel. According to the UN, the World Water Day 2020 campaign explains the following statements: • There is no time to wait and the climate policymakers must now ensure to put water as their main action plans. • Water can help fight change in the climate. There are affordable, sustainable and scalable water and sanitation solutions. • Everyone has a role to play. There are easy ways that we can adopt in our day-to-day lives to address climate change. Ways to conserve water Water is one of the precious and indispensable resources and it is the responsibility of each one of us to use it judiciously. On World Water Day 2020, here are five ways by which you can conserve water. · While bathing, use a bucket instead of shower · Store rainwater, purify and use it · Do not keep the tap turned on while brushing teeth, shaving · Wash vegetables in a bowl of water instead of running the faucet · Wash only full loads in your washing machine to reduce water consumption."
" Today is World Water Day. The theme for 2020 is “Water and climate change”, and how the two are inextricably linked. The official functions that mark such days — the release of reports, speeches by experts and people-centric activities — will be muted this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Nevertheless, there isn’t a more appropriate time to underline the importance of water and its availability because there is a link between bad public hygiene and the spread of diseases. First, to avoid the spread of diseases, India has to ensure clean and adequate water for all. Second, there’s an express need to invest more in water conservation efforts to ensure long-term availability of the resource, given its indiscriminate use and the larger context of the climate crisis. And, third, the State and citizens must continue with the current push to improve general cleanliness and hand-washing even after the current coronavirus outbreak subsides. And for that, citizens will need an assured supply of not just water, but good quality water. The scale of the water challenge, however, is humongous. A 2017 World Bank report said about 160 million of the country’s 1.3 billion people don’t have access to clean water and that 21% of communicable diseases are linked to unsafe water and the lack of hygiene practices. The government’s think tank, NITI Aayog, says 600 million Indians face acute water shortages. Even India’s public health infrastructure, which probably is the first port of call for the poor, often lacks adequate water and sanitation facilities. Barely 18% of rural households have access to piped water. Last year, the Centre said that at least 189.7 million rural habitations are getting less than 40 litres per capita per day, which is the norm while implementing rural water supply schemes for providing potable water. Or take hand-washing. As the number of coronavirus cases detected in India rises, health professionals have suggested frequent hand-washing as a precautionary measure. But getting people to do this may not be easy as many households across the country do not have adequate hand-washing facilities, according to the National Family Health Survey (2015-16). The enumerators could find a designated place for washing hands in about 97% of households surveyed, but not all of them with adequate cleaning facilities. Water was not available in 14% of these households at the place where hands were washed. In urban areas, the share of such households was only 6% compared to 18% in rural areas. To be sure, among the households that had water, about 19% had no cleaning agent such as soap, ash, mud or sand. The Centre has been focusing on water conservation and trying to ensure piped water to households under the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM). However, there is a question of resources. The allocation for JJM in the current financial year is ~11,500 crore, compared to ~10,000 crore last year. The water challenge is only growing. Twenty-one Indian cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, and Hyderabad, will run out of groundwater by 2030, affecting 100 million people, says a NITI Aayog report. Many villages too face a severe water crisis, leading to a development crisis, and it is also forcing people to migrate."
" The rise in zoonotic diseases like the coronavirus disease is linked to the loss of biodiversity and forests, public health experts and scientists have said. Zoonotic diseases are those that spread from animals to humans. There is a consensus among scientists that a rise in zoonotic diseases--Nipah, Ebola, Zika, Coronavirus to name a few in recent decades – is driven by biodiversity loss and climate change. In a press briefing held in New York by the Global Alliance of Indigenous Peoples on Friday, indigenous leaders said the Covid 19 outbreak was a result of loss of native forests and habitat. “The coronavirus is now telling the world what we have been saying for thousands of years—that if we do not help protect biodiversity and nature, then we will face this and worse future threats,” said Levi Sucre Romero, a BriBri indigenous person from Costa Rica who is the Coordinator of the Mesoamerican Alliance of Peoples and Forests. Scientific studies have already flagged this link. The Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (similar to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) in their report last year said that these diseases are significant threats to human health, with vector-borne diseases accounting for approximately 17 % of all infectious diseases and causing an estimated 700,000 deaths globally per year. “Emerging infectious diseases in wildlife, domestic animals, plants or people can be exacerbated by human activities such as land clearing and habitat fragmentation,” the report said. It also highlighted that around 25% of species in the animal and plant groups were under threat, suggesting that around one million species are already facing extinction. The World Health Organization has said there is now evidence of the link between the Covid-19 and other similar known coronaviruses (CoV) circulating in bats. But the route of transmission to humans is still unclear. “There is no doubt that zoonotic diseases are on the rise. One of the reasons for their rise, among many others, is that animals are coming in contact with human habitation...,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)."
" Guess which is the most competent generation of parents when it comes to awareness? A survey by US tech company Winnie suggests it is the millennial parents who make up for 90 per cent of all new parents, are evolved, smarter and given the information and internet era far more exposed compared to their own parents. Ambitious, well-educated and well-informed, millennial parents focus on the overall development and well-being of their children in a more conscious and aware style of holistic upbringing. With more resources at hand, these parents are aware of what works and what does not. This holds to be most true when it comes to health concerns. Millennial parents are on top of what is good for their children’s health. Priyanka Kheruka, Brand Head, Borosil Glass Works Ltd, lists the top three health interventions most millennial parents are following today - Eco-friendly kitchens: For the millennial, the reverse trend of realising the health value of home cooked meals is an important aspect of their daily life. This, however, is juxtaposed against a lack of time with many more layers added to our modern lives including demanding careers and lifestyle. Hence, the need for convenience and health driven kitchen solutions. What you cook and store your food in is an important as what you eat. Millennial parents are moving away from plastics for storage replacing containers with the glass and steel. They are also cooking food in glass, steel and copper utensils. Millennial parents are aware of the harmful effects of plastic, which leaches chemicals into food when heated. For kids and parents who are always on the move, even water bottles and lunch boxes are moving from traditional plastic to glass and steel with unique designs and health benefits, keeping food and water hot or cold and leaching absolutely no chemicals to preserve nutrition. Mindfulness about food and healthy eating: Millennial parents will surprise you with their knowledge on what all goes into what they are feeding their children. Food habits of their children are constantly evolving with exposure to different cuisines and travel experiences enrich their overall choices. Healthy eating, preparing hot food vs frozen and including a mix of ingredients that one point seemed a foreign concept are now all part of the millennial diet. Health has gained a whole new dimension and is approached holistically keeping in mind the purest form food can be given to our children - organic, natural and fresh. Farm to table is a concept that is getting more popular among urban millennials who are often seen sourcing milk and organic vegetables directly from farm vendors. Retaining the freshness of these foods is also essential. Active and hydrated: there is no replacement to the health of children than active play. Digital distractions have made this natural activity now a required deliberate intervention. Millennial parents are consciously, including sports and activity in their children’s lives. However, climate change and pollution has led to harsher weather conditions and hydration is also essential. Keeping our kids hydrated with water and healthy drinks like juice and lemon water are essential as we shrug sugar filled aerated options. Here again, using high quality food grade stainless steel bottles is the best solution. (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.)"
" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has cautioned that a temporary fall in global greenhouse gas emissions, if any, due to the coronavirus outbreak should not be overestimated because the magnitude of climate crisis has no comparison with the temporary impact of the pandemic. “Both coronavirus and climate change are very serious problems… but they are very different in nature. One thing is the disease which we expect to be temporary and its impacts will also be temporary. Climate change has been there for many years and we expect it to remain with us for decades and require constant action. We should not overestimate the fact that emissions have reduced for some months. We will not fight climate change with a virus,” he said at the launch of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) State of Global Climate Report 2019 on Tuesday in New York. “It is important that all the attention needed to fight the disease does not distract us from the need to fight climate change… change anything in the need to have COP26 [2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference] in Glasgow with the commitment to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. We hope that people will be able to commit to both objectives with the same political will,” Guterres added. WMO Secretary General Petteri Taalas said the political uprisings and violence in Syria, Libya, and Egypt are linked to drought and rise in food prices and unemployment. “Climatic factors can lead to such crises globally,” said Taalas. He underlined the WMO report has enough evidence to show that the climate crisis is at its peak and 2020 is the pivotal year to address it. Australia experienced a prolonged and severe fire season in 2019 that continued into January 2020, the report noted. The report had estimated that a global average surface temperature rise of 1.1 degree C to 1.65 degree C will be recorded in the next 10 years. He added it was due to natural variability breaching the lower threshold of the Paris Agreement which is warming of 1.5 degree C. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 degree C had concluded that human-induced warming reached approximately 1 degree C above pre-industrial levels in 2017 and is increasing at 0.2 degree C per decade. The 2019 Arctic winter maximum daily sea ice extent was the 7th lowest maximum on record. According to data from the World Glacier Monitoring Service based on a subset of glaciers, 2018-2019 was the 32nd consecutive year of negative mass balance or receding trend. The WMO report highlights that 2019 saw some of the most deadly heatwaves. Among the most significant were two heatwaves in Europe in late June and late July. Extreme heat also affected India in the pre-monsoon period in May and early June."
" The planet is in intensive care, and it has taken a possible pandemic to shake us out of our inertia. One of the world’s biggest economies, China, came to a halt when the coronavirus was detected. To date, it has affected over 100,000 people in more than 100 countries. Incidentally, the disease was thought to have been transmitted to humans via bats and pangolins, although further research is still needed on its origins. But the virus is more than just a health crisis. It is symptomatic of all that we have unleashed on our planet in the name of development. As we course-correct to combat the coronavirus, even the short-term measures that have been put in place to contain the virus have helped improve the planet’s condition. A recent report of Carbon Tracker, a London-based not-for-profit think tank researching the impact of the climate crisis on financial markets, said that China staved off a quarter or more of its Co2 emissions in two weeks by stopping work at manufacturing units and construction sites to quarantine its workers. These restrictions led to fewer numbers of vehicles on the road, and air travel dropped by 70%. The European Space Agency and NASA images showed a drop in pollutants like nitrogen oxide that lead to respiratory diseases, asthma and breathing problems. Another decision made by the Chinese authorities could have far-reaching implications for the planet. Since the coronavirus is believed to have originated from a wildlife food market, the authorities banned consumption of wildlife meat. A massive crackdown has been initiated on wildlife farms and breeding centres. This could help the conservation of a number of species, in particular the pangolin that has been on the verge of extinction. Pangolin meat is considered a delicacy, and their scales are used in traditional medicine. Experts, however, remain sceptical about whether the ban on wildlife trade will be permanent, and if the restrictions will apply to traditional Chinese medicine as well. Are these measures too little, too late? In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on 1.5°C had said that any warming of 1.5°C is not considered “safe” for most nations, communities, ecosystems and sectors, and poses significant risks to natural and human systems. The same report added: “The principal vectors for dengue fever, chikungunya, yellow fever, and the zika virus — are projected to increase in number, with a larger geographic range by the 2030s than at present, which could put more individuals at risk of the diseases they carry, with regional differences.” And, prophetically, the report stated that incidents of zoonotic diseases will grow. It’s taken a disease in a small province in China to bring the world to a halt. But if we continue to treat this as just a “health crisis”, we are signing ourselves up for more pandemics. The Amazon fires and Australian bushfires are symptomatic of our inertia on climate. And, yet, a state of crisis could give us opportunities to heal the planet. The reduced emissions, even if temporary, means a far lesser number of people are exposed to air pollution, and serve as an example that significant policy shifts aimed at decarbonising our economies could help improve lives. Can we use the coronavirus epidemic as an opportunity to decarbonise our economy, and shake us out of our inertia to respond to the climate crisis? We can cut fossil fuel consumption and air travel, and ban wildlife trade to save ourselves from pandemics, and also help the planet to heal.

" Eight-year-old climate activist Licypriya Kangujam, who turned down Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s honour of joining the #SheInspiresUs campaign, said that she rejected the offer because nobody paid heed to any of her demands over the years. Speaking to PTI, Kangujam said that initially she was both happy and sad to learn about the honour, but eventually decided to turn it down since politicians never take the issue of climate change seriously. “Over the years they haven’t listened to any of my demands despite protesting continuously in front of the Parliament and many other places across the country with thousands of children and youths,” she lamented. She recalled, in June last year, seven MPs of the Rajya Sabha after her protest in front of the Parliament House, moved a Calling Attention Motion on the issue, but the minister of Environment and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar said that India would not bow down to international pressure on climate change. The minister’s response was not up to her expectations, she said. Kangujam is known as Indian ‘Greta’, after being compared to award-winning Swedish teenage environment activist Greta Thunberg, for her passion towards the fight against climate change. Ever since her foray into climate activism, Kangujam, who was conferred the Rising Star by the Washington DC-based Earth Day Network last year, made her demands clear -- that the government should enact a climate law to regulate carbon emissions and other greenhouse gases. Such a law will bring in transparency, she said. She also demanded that climate change should be made a compulsory subject in schools because she believes that it will help in the fight against climate change from the grassroots level. “It will also help in educating our leaders as they would learn about the issue from their children and grandchildren,” she said, adding that the leaders just cannot believe that science and climate change is real. Planting of at least three trees by a student to pass their exam will lead to the plantation of at least 3.5 billion trees a year as “we have 350 million students” asserted Licypriya who believed it will make the country green in five years."
" More than 500 endangered turtles were seized near a Kolkata railway station on Saturday morning by personnel of the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) of the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change and the West Bengal forest department from two smugglers belonging to Sultanpur in Uttar Pradesh. The team seized 519 Indian softshell turtles, two Peacock softshell turtles and two Gangetic softshell turtles. The Peacock softshell turtle figures in the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as ‘threatened species’. The smugglers were travelling in the Purvanchal Express and wanted to take the turtles to Basirhat in North 24 Parganas district, said Agni Mitra, deputy director, WCCB (eastern region). The train travels between Gorakhpur and Kolkata. The smugglers were identified as Jain Kumar, 40, and Sunil Kanjar, 23. Smuggling of endangered turtles, which are considered a delicacy in some parts of Bengal and Bangladesh, has become a cause for concern for the Central agency, especially because smugglers have started using innovative methods. In a first, families travelling with women and children from UP were caught red-handed on February 1. They were carrying around 650 Indian softshell turtles in their luggage and school bags. WBCCB arrested 14 men and eight women, making it the biggest arrest in recent history. There were several children in the group. The families posed as common travellers to evade suspicion. The arrested people said they were to sell the turtles at Rs 300 a kilo. The raids are being carried out on a regular basis as part of Operation Turtshield, a new Central programme to protect endangered turtles. On January 12, the officers seized 983 Indian flap-shell turtles and two Indian peacock softshell turtles from a market at Bongaon in North-24 Parganas."
" The union environment and forest ministry has told a House panel that its efforts to check pollution will be affected because it has received 30% less funds than what it demanded in the annual budget. The ministry maintained that the paucity of funds is “going to impact the activities under pollution control, especially taking up 20 more non-attainment cities in addition to the existing 102, under the National Clean Air Programme.” Last August, 20 more cities across eight states were added by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to its list of polluted cities that do not meet the national ambient air quality standard NAAQS. Dubbed as non-attainment cities, these places are the top priority for the Centre in controlling pollution. The report of the parliamentary standing committee on Demand for Grants of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change revealed that the ministry wanted Rs 600 crore for ‘Control of Pollution’ during 2020-21 but got Rs 460 crore. “It was going to impact the activities under pollution control, especially taking up 20 more non-attainment cities in addition to the existing 102, under the National Clean Air Programme,” it said. The panel led by former environment minister Jairam Ramesh suggested that the Centre must give “topmost priority” to control air pollution and provide additional funds in the coming months. “The allocation of additional funds would help support additional 22 non-attainment cities under ‘Control of Pollution’ scheme. The Committee, therefore, recommends that the Ministry must be provided the requisite allocation as sought by the Ministry with respect to these two programmes at the RE stage.” Last year, in post-Diwali Delhi, pollution reached an alarming level. AQI touched 494 on November 3, the most hazardous level since 2016. A blanket of smog covered Delhi and people complained of breathlessness and burning sensation in their eyes before wind blew away pollutants, showing how the Capital was defenceless against unfavourable weather conditions that exacerbate the impact of local sources of pollution and farm fires in Punjab and Haryana. Overall too, the ministry has received lower funds than its projected expenses for FY20-21. During a meeting between ministry officials and panel members on February 18, 2020, it was discussed that the ministry had projected a demand of Rs 4,295.44 crore for FY2020-21 but received an allocation of Rs 3,100 crore. “The committee asked the ministry about the bare minimum increase required in the budgetary allocations for the year 2020-21 to sustain its key programmes. In response, the ministry stated that they require at least Rs 600 crore additional funds to sustain its key programmes/schemes during the year,” the report added."
" The Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra on Friday tabled its first budget worth Rs 4.34 lakh crore in the state legislature, which aims at pleasing all its core constituencies especially the farmers. Maharashtra’s finance minister Ajit Pawar, who presented the budget, announced Rs 22,000 crore for farmers under the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Loan waiver scheme. The scheme has now been expanded to include agriculturists with outstanding loans of more than Rs 200,000 and an incentive of Rs 50,000 for those who repay them on time. The state government has also envisaged an employment generation scheme for the educated unemployed, which will help train those between 21 to 28 years of age. It also plans to pay a stipend to these youngsters. The overall budget of the scheme is Rs 6000 crore and it plans to train 10 lakh youth in five years. Pawar also announced a special law to ensure priority to locals in jobs. By announcing sops for farmers and unemployed youth, the MVA government has delivered on the two core promises made in its manifestos ahead of the state assembly polls. Thackeray’s pet scheme of offering subsidised food to the poor, the Rs 10 thali, has been allocated Rs 150 crore for this year and will now feed 100,000 people. For the urban middle class, the budget has some promises on one hand and pinched their pockets on the other. Ajit Pawar announced a cut of 1% on stamp duty on all real estate deals for homebuyers in Mumbai, Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Pune and Nagpur for two years. This will translate into a relief of Rs 100,000 for a home priced at Rs 1 crore. The state had a stamp duty of 5% and an additional surcharge of 1% on such deals. However, the finance department has increased the price of petrol and diesel across the state by Re 1 per litre to create a Green Fund aimed at tackling climate change. This, the finance minister said, will mop up resources worth Rs 1800 crore which will be used only for green initiatives. There are several other feel-good measures in the budget that aims at some sop or announcement for every section of the society. These include a special scheme to construct 1500 ideal public schools with state of the art infrastructure at Rs 5000 crore for five years, revamping for state transport buses at Rs 1600 crore, women-only police stations in every district and tourism initiatives, including a modern aquarium in Worli. Sena minister and Yuva Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray’s tourism department has been allocated Rs 1000 crore. “Overall, we have tried to consider every section of the society mainly farmers, youth and women. The state is witnessing economic slowdown and there are challenges in employment so we have tried to give some concession to the industry by reducing power rates and real estate industry and homebuyers by slashing the stamp duty,” said Pawar. He admitted the loan waiver for farmers along with the seventh pay commission had burdened the state exchequer and this was expected to take the debt to Rs 5.20 lakh crore by the end of this fiscal. The revenue deficit in 2020-21 is estimated at Rs 9510 crore, while the fiscal deficit is estimated at Rs 54,618 crore. The revised estimates for the year 2019-20 show the strain on the state coffers."
" “I hadn’t intended to speak, but as I have been following the Coastal Road story for a few years and listening to so many authorities raise their concerns about it, I felt a sort of duty to speak up and amicably express my views and the views of many others,” says actor and producer-host of the Tara Sharma Show, about the public hearing on the matter that she had attended on Wednesday at the Old Customs House. Along with representatives of the Koli community, environmentalists and citizens, Sharma had voiced her concerns, in her characteristic pleasant and measured style. “Basically I am not anti-development,” she said. “But I am an advocate of responsible development and cannot understand why it is not being built on stilts, which is a cheaper option or as a sea link, instead of this mass reclamation, which is destroying livelihoods of Kolis, marine and bird habitat, the beauty of heritage sights – Mahalaxmi temple and Haji Ali Dargah – and the gorgeous coastline which to citizens like us, in many ways, defines our city.” Sharma, daughter of actor, playwright and iconic voice of Independent India, the late Partap Sharma, says she is inspired to speak out for future generations by her parents. “My impromptu speakup had a lot to do with how my parents raised me. Climate change is real and blocking the water, by dumping rocks will eventually act as a dam causing worse flooding. So as a young mother, all I did was amicably request the kind officials present to try and make some part of it on stilts, as they are doing in the northern stretch.” But for all her effort, the busy media maven and mother of two, who is already working on Season 6 of her show, says she will accept the outcome. “Many say it is too late to do anything, and if nothing can be done, I will accept it, but in the knowledge that for my kids and all children everywhere in the future, I tried. I believe every little voice helps.”               "
             
" With stores in India and New York, multiple clothing brands and a global celebrity following, fashion designer Anita Dongre is a feminist powerhouse in a male-dominated industry. But her true ambition is to create an environmentally sustainable company, she says. “Sometimes I wish I could just give up design and focus on sustainability full-time,” the Mumbai-based Dongre tells AFP during an interview at her factory outside India’s financial capital. “Time is running out. Climate change is right at our doorstep and we all have to do something,” says the 56-year-old, whose clothes have been worn by some of the world’s most high-profile women including Hillary Clinton, Kate Middleton, Ivanka Trump, Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Beyonce. Turning a company with an annual turnover of $105 million into a carbon-neutral enterprise is a daunting proposition, but Dongre has never been one to shy away from challenges. When she started her business aged 23, armed with two sewing machines and a staff of two male tailors perched on the balcony of the bedroom she shared with her sisters, she was the first woman in her conservative family to work. Today, she says that of all her accomplishments, she is proudest of her commitment that no woman seeking work will ever be turned away from the gates of the four-storey factory she runs. “I see my journey reflected in theirs,” she says, emphasising her belief that “economic empowerment is the only way a woman can assert herself”. Besides producing five clothing lines, hand-crafted fine jewelry and accessories, her foundation provides training and jobs to more than 250 rural women, with plans to cover 30 villages by 2025. Greenwashing risks Feminist values have been at the heart of her brand: her clothing has always been size-inclusive, going up to an XXL. Even when she ventured into bridal wear, her advertising campaigns challenged traditional norms and featured women sporting tattoos, enjoying their wine, and paying for their weddings. “It is very important for me to show a woman who is not coy or veiled -- someone bold and sassy. I was that girl. I drove a jeep. I proposed to my husband,” she says. “The world has never been fair to women... and I am not comfortable promoting regressive ideas to sell clothes,” she adds. Her decision to focus on the urban professional woman has seen the brand reap dividends as female spending power increases in India. “It’s so rewarding to walk into stores and meet the women who buy my clothes. When a customer tells me, ‘I wore your blazer to my first job interview 15 years ago and I got the job’, it’s thrilling,” she says. She will need to rely on that goodwill to convince customers to shop in a wholly different way than they are used to: prioritising sustainability and slow fashion over instant gratification. On the one hand, Dongre’s task has never been easier -- when she spoke about environmentally-friendly design more than a decade ago, few paid attention. Today, she says drolly, “I am glad it’s finally fashionable to be green”. On the other hand, greenwashing remains a huge risk, she explains. “You can’t take a sustainable fabric, cover it with plastic sequins and still call it sustainable.” Do more and more She is the only Indian designer to join the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC), a global alliance of retailers, brands, suppliers, campaigners and labour groups that provides members with the tools to measure the environmental impact of their activities. The SAC is a non-binding organisation, meaning members are largely responsible for their own efforts towards sustainability and transparency. For her part, Dongre says she feels a drive “to do more and more” on the environmental front. At her factory, cafeteria food waste is composted or used to make biogas while the water utilised in clothing production is recycled and pumped back into the bathrooms. Her lower-priced brands and globaldesi use fabrics such as sustainably-produced tencel - a biodegradable fibre made of wood pulp - while the slow fashion luxury label Grassroot showcases hand-woven, hand-embroidered designs created by Indian artisans. Yet this commitment to sustainability and to preserving dying crafts comes with risks attached, as Dongre realises. “The biggest challenge is educating the consumer to support our efforts,” she says. Moreover, it is hard to imagine how a huge company that employs 2,700 people and works with thousands of artisans can be environmentally responsible without compromising on profits. It is a price she is willing to pay. “Companies cannot be driven only by profits... this idea of making money in whatever way possible and then giving large sums to charity, it’s not sustainable. Why not make contribution to your community a focus of your business to begin with?” “It’s high time companies measured their success in terms of sustainability, not just profit and loss,” she says.

" Greta Thunberg denounced politicians and the media on Friday for failing her generation, saying the world is on fire but they are ignoring a looming climate cataclysm. Several thousand people attended a rally in the southwestern English city of Bristol to see Thunberg, the teenage activist who has reprimanded governments across the world over climate change. Known simply as Greta, 17-year-old Thunberg has captured the imagination of many young people with impassioned demands for world leaders to take urgent action. “I will not be silenced while the world is on fire - will you?” said Thunberg. “This emergency is being completely ignored by the politicians, the media and those in power. Basically nothing is being done ... despite all the beautiful words.” Supporters held placards reading: “Change the politics not the climate”, “The ocean is rising so are we!” and “At this point education is pointless.” Thunberg rose to prominence when she starting missing lessons two years ago to protest outside the Swedish parliament building. Since then, she has become the world’s most prominent climate activist. She has repeatedly upbraided world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump for ignoring the perils of climate change, though Trump has dismissed what he calls the climate “prophets of doom”. “Our house is still on fire,” Thunberg told the World Economic Forum in Davos last month. “Your inaction is fuelling the flames.” Thunberg has been in Britain since last weekend. On Tuesday she visited the University of Oxford, where she met Malala Yousafzai, the 22-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner and campaigner for girls’ education, who is studying there."
" Senator Bernie Sanders, the Democratic frontrunner for the presidential nomination, has said it was a “failure of leadership” for President Donald Trump to dismiss ongoing clashes between protestors and supporters of the new citizenship amendment law in India as an internal matter during his visit. The senator had earlier criticized the $3 billion defence deal announced by India and the United States during Trump’s visit, saying the two countries should instead work together to combat climate change. “Over 200 million Muslims call India home,” Sanders wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “Widespread anti-Muslim mob violence has killed at least 27 and injured many more. Trump responds by saying, ‘That’s up to India.’ This is a failure of leadership on human rights.” Asked about his position on the Citizenship Amendment Act at a news conference in New Delhi on Tuesday, President Trump had said, “I don’t want to discuss that. I want to leave that to India, and hopefully they’re going to make the right decision for the people. That’s really up to India.” Asked specially about the violence and casualties, the president had taken much the same line. “That’s up to India,” he said. On Thursday, the state department called for peace and respect for the right of peaceful assembly. “Our hearts go out to the families of the deceased and injured in New Delhi,” Alice G Wells, the top diplomat for South and Central Asia, wrote on Twitter. “We echo PM @NarendraModi’s call for calm and normalcy and urge all parties to maintain peace, refrain from violence, and respect the right of peaceful assembly.” Trump did raise the issue of religious freedom with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and came away satisfied with what he heard. “I will say that the Prime Minister was incredible on what he told me. He wants people to have religious freedom, and very strongly. And he said that in India they have -- they have worked very hard to have great and open religious freedom.” Critics had expected Trump to be more forceful, perhaps along the same lines as President Barack Obama during his 2015 visit. There is a need to reaffirm, he had said in a speech at Siri Fort, “that every person has the right to practice their faith how they choose, or to practice no faith at all, and to do so free of persecution and fear and discrimination”. He had added, “India will succeed so long as it is not splintered along the lines of religious faith -- so long as it’s not splintered along any lines -- and is unified as one nation.” The Wednesday tweet was the third time Sanders had taken aim at India while running for president this time (he ran in 2016 also). In August, the senator had criticized the restrictions imposed in Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370, and demanded they be lifted and “the United States government must speak out boldly in support of international humanitarian law and its support of a UN-backed peaceful resolution that respects the will of the Kashmiri people.”"
" Senator Bernie Sanders, the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination, on Monday slammed the arms deal agreed between India and United States during President Donald Trump’s visit as a sop to “enrich” defence firms and said the two countries should rather work together to combat climate change. “Instead of selling $3 billion in weapons to enrich Raytheon, Boeing and Lockheed, the United States should be partnering with India to fight climate change,” the senator wrote on twitter, referring to the three big defense manufacturers. “We can work together to cut air pollution, create good renewable energy jobs, and save our planet.” India is a signatory to the 2015 Paris Accord and has continued to work towards its self-determined mitigation targets. The United States, on the other hand, was pulled out of the accord by President Trump, who has since gone on to reverse many mitigation measures, seriously imperiling its ability to meet its self-determined targets. Sanders, who has endorsed and adopted a progressive plan to combat climate change called the “Green Deal”, has been critical of the president’s decision to pull out of the Paris Accord and then rescind anti-climate change steps announced by the previous administration of President Barack Obama. His criticism of the sale of $3 billion worth of military helicopters and other equipment to India was intriguing as India doesn’t need to be pushed, if that is indeed what he is suggesting, to fight climate change, which it has acknowledged as a serious challenge and has resolved to fight it. India continues to work with other signatory countries to take the accord forward, in fact, through new alliances such as the award-winning Solar Alliance with France and launched a Coalition for Disaster-Resilient Infrastructure at the UN climate action summit in 2019. As a testimony to its efforts, the Climate Action Tracker, which monitors countries and their ability to meet their Paris Accord targets, has said India has emerged as a global leader in renewable energy, and remains on track to “overachieve” targets. The tracker rates the United States’s actions as “insufficient”, and given Trump administration’s to pull it out of the accord, “critically insufficient.” The senator might be arguing here for the United States to work with India to combat climate change instead of selling it arms. But the two are not binary choices, The senator in now at the top of the Democratic race for the presidential nomination, and has tightened his grip on through significant victories in nominating contests, such as in Nevada last week. Former Vice-President Joe Biden still leads in the polls though, according to the RealClearPolitics aggregate. The senator has criticized India for the restrictions in Kashmir imposed the abrogation of Article 370 in August. “India’s action is unacceptable,” Sanders said last September. “The communications blockade must be lifted immediately and the United States government must speak out boldly in support of international humanitarian law and its support of a UN-backed peaceful resolution that respects the will of the Kashmiri people.”"
" One hundred and thirty countries including India on Saturday endorsed a declaration that one million migratory species were confronting extinction, and many of them may vanish within a few decades, underscoring the urgency to protect and conserve such species. The Gandhinagar Declaration of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) also stressed that “ecological connectivity” of migratory species will be key to arresting their decline. The Declaration was released on the concluding day of the 13th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS COP13) in Gandhinagar on Saturday. The parties include India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, the Philippines, France, Australia and Argentina. The US and China are not among them.    "
    
" Rising temperatures, a growing water crisis, changing rainfall patterns — climate change is the crisis of our times, and universities have started responding with specialised courses that allow students to trace the causes and study the fallouts. These courses are typically open to students from across backgrounds, and most of the courses have been around less than five years. Jindal Global University started a Master of Laws (LLM) in environmental law, energy and climate change in August; Shiv Nadar University has been offering a postgraduate course in water science and policy since August 2017; Ashoka University has had courses on climate change as part of the earth science courses, and as part of literature (climate fiction), since 2016; the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) offers a course in climate change and sustainability studies and multiple Indian Institutes of Technology have climate change and climate studies courses. The number of courses on offer needs to grow, says LS Shashidhara, distinguished professor of biology at Ashoka University, who has been working in the field of climate change education for five years and is now coordinating an international project to develop courses and lesson plans on climate change to train teachers. “The impact of climate change is not uniform across the globe. The solutions too will have to be more local. This means more people from around the world need to be educated and involved in mitigation efforts,” he says. Though it is not yet clear what role climate change professionals are going to play, all industries will have to comply with international agreements and thereby place in action many measures to reduce their carbon footprint. Shashidhara says this will create demand for mitigation experts; once there are more experts, hopefully innovative solutions will emerge. Which will, in turn, change the way industries function. MANY PATHS Most courses are, for obvious reasons, taking an interdisciplinary approach. The TISS postgraduate course aims to conduct research, teach and advocate in areas like resource economics and environmental governance. Shiva Nadar University is aiming to create a cadre of ‘water professionals’, to create awareness of the water crisis as it unfolds, and work on interventions. “To understand the water crisis, for instance, one needs understand both the natural and social sciences that influence it,” says Rajeshwari Raina, professor of international relations and governance studies at Shiv Nadar University. The course hence covers topics like how to measure erosion or hydrogeology, which is the science of distribution and movement of ground water, along India’s water policies over the years – starting with the big dams and including the recent policy on groundwater formulated in December. Shrabani S Tripathy, who is working on a PhD in climate studies at IIT-Bombay after finishing a Masters in the same from IIT-Bhubaneshwar, the goal is to eventually be able to combine theoretical knowledge of natural science with social science. “I work on floods. It is a common concern now and the meteorological measurements are being done but there also an important aspect of subjective ability of a place to cope. So a town in Rajasthan for example is way less prepared for a flood than Mumbai,” she says. Even in a more nascent field like environmental law, Arjya B Majumdar, director of admissions at OP Jindal Global University, is optimistic about growing job opportunities."
" External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has met top leaders of the European Union and held wide-ranging talks on key issues such as combating terrorism, climate change and enhancing economic cooperation, that would “benefit both India and the EU”. Jaishankar, who was in Germany during the weekend for the prestigious Munich Security Conference, arrived here on Monday to prepare the ground for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s planned visit for the India-EU summit here next month. He was here at the invitation of Josep Borrell Fontelles, European Union’s High Representative/Vice President for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, for a discussion with the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) of the EU, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in a statement. The FAC, constituted by the EU High Representative and the 27 Foreign Ministers of bloc’s members, is responsible for the EU’s external action on foreign policy, defence and security, trade, development cooperation and humanitarian assistance. Jaishankar shared with the FAC India’s foreign policy priorities and regional and global perspective. “The focus of the exchange was on the common values of India and the EU, which represent the world’s two largest democracies and their shared commitment to democracy, multilateralism, rules-based international order, rules-based international trade with the WTO at its core and sustainable development,” according to the statement. Both the sides expect to deepen their engagement - particularly on common priorities such as addressing climate change, safeguarding multilateralism, cooperation in defence, security, connectivity, digital economy, trade and investment as also in the field of defence security and addressing the menace of terrorism, it said. This was Jaishankar’s first visit to the EU after the assumption of office of the new Commission in December 2019. The foreign minister met EU Commissioner for International Partnerships Jutta Urpilainen and the two leaders discussed experiences in capacity building and development partnerships. “Coordination on these issues would be to the benefit of both India and EU,” Jaishankar tweeted. The minister also held “positive and productive” parleys at the Foreign Affairs Council of the EU. “Thank the attending Foreign Ministers, Ambassadors & senior officials and most of all HR (High Representative) @JosepBorrellF. Looking forward to working together to strengthen this key partnership,” he said. Jaishankar also met EU Commissioner for Trade Phil Hogan and “exchanged views on the prospects for India-EU economic cooperation.” He appreciated President of the European Council Charles Michel for his vision for the EU and Eu-India relations and expressed confident that “his (Michel) leadership can translate that into substantive outcomes.” Jaishankar held a very “engaging” conversation with Executive Vice-President for the European Green Deal Frans Timmermans and the two leaders discussed experiences on sustainability, climate change, environment and innovation. Jaishankar also had an open discussion with members of the European Parliament representing a broad spectrum of politics and member states. “The interaction covered political, economic and social issues. Noted their deep interest in India and our relations with the EU,” he tweeted. Jaishankar met Philippe Goffin, Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs and of Defence and congratulated him on Belgium’s assumption of the Presidency of the UNSC for February 2020. The two ministers discussed India-Belgium cooperation in the bilateral context, in multilateral fora as well as regional and global issues of shared interest. During his one-day visit, Jaishankar exchanged views with a group of members of the European Parliament representing various members and political groupings in the new European Parliament. This was his second such interaction with the MEPs. Jaishankar’s visit comes weeks after the European Parliament postponed until March a vote on a joint motion, combining five different resolutions tabled by its members against India’s Citizenship Amendment Act, which was debated at its Plenary session in Brussels."
      
" External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar met top leaders of the European Union and held wide-ranging talks on issues, including economic cooperation, climate change and capacity building, that would “benefit both India and EU”. Jaishankar, who was in Germany during the weekend for the Munich Security Conference, arrived here on Monday to prepare the ground for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s planned visit for the India-EU summit here next month. The foreign minister met EU Commissioner for International Partnerships Jutta Urpilainen and the two leaders discussed experiences in capacity building and development partnerships. “Coordination on these issues would be to the benefit of both India and EU,” Jaishankar tweeted. The minister also held “positive and productive” parleys at the Foreign Affairs Council of the EU. “Thank the attending Foreign Ministers, Ambassadors & senior officials and most of all HR (High Representative) @JosepBorrellF. Looking forward to working together to strengthen this key partnership,” he said. Jaishankar also met EU Commissioner for Trade Phil Hogan and “exchanged views on the prospects for India-EU economic cooperation.” He appreciated President of the European Council Charles Michel for his vision for the EU and Eu-India relations and expressed confident that “his (Michel) leadership can translate that into substantive outcomes.” Jaishankar held a very “engaging” conversation with Executive Vice-President for the European Green Deal Frans Timmermans and the two leaders discussed experiences on sustainability, climate change, environment and innovation. Jaishankar also had an open discussion with members of the European Parliament representing a broad spectrum of politics and member states. “The interaction covered political, economic and social issues. Noted their deep interest in India and our relations with the EU,” he tweeted. Jaishankar’s visit comes weeks after the European Parliament postponed until March a vote on a joint motion, combining five different resolutions tabled by its members against India’s Citizenship Amendment Act, which was debated at its Plenary session in Brussels."
" His company is often criticized for its environmental record, but Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon and the world’s richest man, said Monday that he was committing $10 billion to a new fund to tackle climate change. In a post to his 1.4 million followers on Instagram, the e-commerce tycoon said the Bezos Earth Fund would “fund scientists, activists, NGOs -- any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world.” “Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet,” said Bezos, whose net worth is estimated to be around $130 billion. Hundreds of Amazon employees last month signed a blog criticizing the online retail giant’s climate policies and demanding it do more to tackle climate change. Amazon has been accused of creating vast amounts of waste from the packaging it uses for doorstep deliveries, as well as for the greenhouse gas emissions from huge fleets of vehicles. The company, which in December said its workforce had hit 750,000, has also been denounced over its carbon footprint because of the high energy consumption of its server farms for its lucrative cloud computing activities. “I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet we all share,” Bezos said in his announcement on Monday. - Amazon’s carbon targets - Bezos, who maintained his status as the world’s richest person despite an expensive divorce last year, said his new foundation would begin issuing grants later this year. Last September, he said Amazon would pledge to become carbon neutral by 2040 and vowed that the company would order 100,000 electric delivery trucks. Rather than make investments that the business guru might profit from, the fund would allocate grant money to projects, The New York Times said, quoting unnamed sources familiar with the initiative. Bezos divulged few details on his social media post, which attracted overwhelmingly positive responses from his followers. Bezos has often clashed with US President Donald Trump, who regularly attacks climate change activists, recently calling them “perennial prophets of doom.” The fund was described as Bezos’s biggest philanthropic commitment. Fellow billionaire Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, now devotes much of his time to his charity foundation and a venture fund that makes investments aimed at helping curb emissions and reverse climate change. The New York Times said that even if Bezos spent the full $10 billion immediately, he would still be the world’s richest person."
               
" India and Norway will work together in exerting pressure on all countries for quick climate action and stressed that the finances promised to the developing world should be followed up, Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said on Sunday. Javadekar held “fruitful” talks with Norwegian Climate and Environment Minister Sveinung Rotevatn on bilateral and global issues at the 13th Conference of Parties (COP 13) to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) here. “We have agreed upon working jointly with Norway on the issues including development of relevant technology and create pressure for quick action on all countries. We also agreed upon strengthening our bond so that we can have joint efforts in waste management, ensuring marine litter goes down rapidly and India’s cooling action plan speeds up. “On climate change we have stressed that finances, which were promised to the developing world and have not come in the last 10 years, needs to be followed up. The amount stands at USD 1 trillion. All countries should create a buzz around it. So we have decided to partner in progress,” Javadekar said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be officially inaugurating on Monday the CMS COP 13, which is being attended by 1,800 delegates from nearly 130 countries. The Norwegian minister said India is showing that economic growth and bold action on climate can go hand in hand. “Norway sees India as an important international player on climate and environment. India is showing the world that economic growth and bold action on climate can go hand in hand. We are impressed with India’s efforts to beat plastic pollution, including ‘Clean India Campaign’. “Today we had a productive meeting. We discussed issues like bio-diversity, explored opportunities that come with forest preservation and saving carbon sinks. We also discussed issue of marine littering and fight to establish good waste management facilities,” Rotevatn said. India and Norway signed the letter of intent for establishing the India Norway Marine Pollution Initiative in 2019 to combat ocean pollution and had also signed an MoU to establish India-Norway Ocean Dialogue. In the meeting at the COP 13, both the countries decided to step up actions that target climate change and air pollution and agreed to work closely to raise this agenda. Later, in a high-level segment with all stakeholders, Javadekar said that 2020 is a “super year for bio-diversity environment”. “This is the biggest conference in the world. I can say that 2020 will be a super year for biodiversity and environment. It will set an agenda for next decade. I am very happy,” the minister said. He said, “India cooperates with many countries on different initiatives. PM Narendra Modi has already formed two alliances – solar alliance and Climate Disaster Resilience Initiative (CDRI).  “2020 is super year for environment. This COP will present to the world. Agenda for an entire decade will be set in this COP. We have decided to work hard. We want inclusive growth of forests, wildlife and biodiversity.” The high-level segment was attended by all participating countries and its representatives. Addressing the participants, Babul Supriyo, minister of state for environment, said, “I am very proud that India is hosting this conference.” Speaking at the conference which aims at conservation of migratory species, Supriyo said, “We are also migrating from one department to another. Today I am in the environment ministry, tomorrow I may be in petroleum.” As the host, India shall be designated the President for the next three years. The Government of India is Signatory to the Convention on Conservation of Migratory Wild Animals since 1983. The Government of India has been taking necessary actions to protect and conserve migratory marine species. Seven species that include dugong, whale shark, and two species of the marine turtle have been identified for preparation of Conservation and Recovery Action Plan. The theme of CMS COP13 in India is ‘Migratory species connect the planet and we welcome them home’."
" Scientists in Antarctica have recorded a new record temperature of 20.75 degrees Celsius (69.35 Fahrenheit), breaking the barrier of 20 degrees for the first time on the continent, a researcher said Thursday. “We’d never seen a temperature this high in Antarctica,” Brazilian scientist Carlos Schaefer told AFP. He cautioned that the reading, taken at a monitoring station on an island off the continent’s northern tip on February 9, “has no meaning in terms of a climate-change trend,” because it is a one-off temperature and not part of a long-term data set. But news that the icy continent is now recording temperatures in the relatively balmy 20s is likely to further fuel fears about the warming of the planet. The reading was taken at Seymour Island, part of a chain off the peninsula that curves out from the northern tip of Antarctica. The island is home to Argentina’s Marambio research base. Schaefer, a soil scientist, said the reading was taken as part of a 20-year-old research project on the impact of climate change on the region’s permafrost. The previous high was in the 19s, he said. “We can’t use this to anticipate climatic changes in the future. It’s a data point,” he said. “It’s simply a signal that something different is happening in that area.” Still, he added, a temperature that high had never been registered in Antarctica. Accelerating melt-off from glaciers and especially ice sheets in Antarctica is helping drive sea level rises, threatening coastal megacities and small island nations. The news came a week after Argentina’s National Meteorological Service recorded the hottest day on record for Argentine Antarctica: 18.3 degrees Celsius at midday at the Esperanza base, located near the tip of the Antarctic peninsula. The previous record stood at 17.5 degrees on March 24, 2015, it said. It has been recording Antarctic temperatures since 1961. The past decade has been the hottest on record, the United Nations said last month, with 2019 the second-hottest year ever, after 2016."
" RK Pachauri, former chairman of the Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and former director general of The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), has passed away, TERI announced on Thursday. Pachauri was 79. He died of cardiac complications according to Fortis Escorts. As the head of the IPCC, a United Nations body that assesses the science related to climate crisis and informs global policy, between 2002 and 2015, Pachauri’s team drafted iconic scientific reports on the climate emergency that later formed the basis for the 2015 Paris Agreement to which 195 nations are signatories. The IPCC won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with former US President Al Gore for its work on climate change under Pachauri, who was conferred the Padma Bhushan, the third-highest Indian civilian honour, in 2001 and the Padma Vibhushan, the second highest, in 2008 for his contribution to science and the environment.

" Lovebirds in the Bihar capital may give the ubiquitous rose a slip this Valentine’s Day, thanks to a drive launched by the state government. “Pyaar ka paudha” (a plant of love) is the name of the initiative launched by department of environment and forest, which seeks to encourage young men and women to exchange saplings which live longer than the exquisite, fragrant flowers that wilt too soon. “Plantation of trees and saplings is being promoted on war footing as part of the Jal Jeevan Hariyali campaign. Valentine’s Day struck to us as an occasion when the effort could be given a boost,” the department’s Principal Secretary Dipak Kumar Singh said. He said as part of the “pyaar ka paudha” initiative, stalls have been set up at select locations in the city, known to be frequented by young couples intending to celebrate Cupid, where saplings would be available at affordable rates. “Care has been taken to ensure that the saplings are of varieties which can grow in flower vases, kept in places where sunlight may not be in abundance. Most dwelling places in the urban sprawl are marked by such conditions”, he said. Yet another thing being factored in, while deciding the plants, is that these should be emitting sufficient oxygen, Singh said, adding that this is vital in view of Jal Jeevan Hariyali campaign’s wider concern being combating climate change. Conceptualised after a meeting of both houses of the state legislature convened by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar last year, Jal Jeevan Hariyali is an initiative that seeks to combat climate change through conservation of environment and has earned plaudits from several corners. Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who met Kumar here in November last year, had also raved about the impoverished state’s ambitious drive. February 14 is celebrated as Valentine’s Day across the world. On the day, people express their love and affection with greetings and gifts. Singh, however, made it clear that “pyaar kaa paudha” was there to stay even after the festival of love was over. “Of course, these stalls will be very much there after February 14 as our message - gift your loved ones a sapling instead of a flower - will resonate with the people even after the buzz surrounding Valentine’s Day is over. “We have sought to convey the message that a sapling bears flowers and fruits and has the potential to grow into a big tree if conditions allow. And this is the way we wish our relationships to be,” he said. This is a pilot project that the government has launched in Patna. “If we are satisfied with the results, we would like to replicate the experiment across the state,” he added.

" Every year, tens of thousands of tourists flock to the snow festival in the northern Japanese city of Sapporo, attracted by some 200 large, but intricate ice sculptures. But this year, there’s a problem: no snow. With high temperatures that festival-goers put down to climate change, organisers were forced to truck in powder from distant towns for their signature sculptures in an unheard-of ice crisis. “This lack of snow is unprecedented,” said Yumato Sato, an official in charge of organising the snow festival, which normally uses 30,000 tonnes of the stuff for sculptures ranging from anime characters to famous racehorses. “We had to bring in snow from places we had never reached out to before” such as Niseko, a town about 60 kilometres (40 miles) away from Sapporo famous for its skiing, he said. Adding to the problem was the need for pristine snow, perfect for sculpting. “The snow needs to be free of dirt, otherwise the sculptures can break up,” he said. “We barely managed to scrape together enough snow.” Record low snowfall in Japan this year has also forced many ski resorts to shut their pistes. According to Weathernews, one quarter of the 400 resorts surveyed had been unable to operate. There has been a knock-on effect on one of the snow festival’s main attractions -- a 100-metre-long, 10-metre-high slide -- that had to be reduced in size. - ‘Once before I die’ - Snowfall in Sapporo has been less than half the annual average, according to the Japan Meterological Agency’s local observatory. High temperatures melted the snow in mid-December and the mercury is expected to stay above average. This posed a major challenge for the 125 local Self-Defense Forces troops who painstakingly construct the sculptures each year that can be as high as 15 metres, according to commanding officer Colonel Minoru Suzuki. “Due to record warm weather this year, we didn’t have much snow and the snow contained more water which made the statues melt easily,” Suzuki told AFP. His troops spent about 100 days planning and building a 15-metre tall, 20-metre wide statue modelled on the palace at Lazienki Park in Warsaw to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Japanese-Polish diplomatic relations in 2019. “We had to keep repairing the statue so we struggled. It was difficult to attach parts because it was so warm,” he added. The festival has been running for 70 years and is a major tourist magnet, drawing 2.7 million visitors last year. Sunao Kinoshita, a 75-year-old who had travelled up from near Osaka, said he “had to see it once before I die”. “Northern Japanese cities have been hosting snow festivals every year. It would be a shame if such events ended” due to global warming, he said. A regular festival-goer from the region also laid the blame on global warming. “I was worried the climate was different this year,” Ayaka Muto, 31, told AFP. “Usually we have more snow. I think it’s strange. I feel global warming is happening,” added Muto. - ‘Serious and a disaster’ - The main theme of this year’s festival, which runs until February 11, is the ethnic Ainu minority in Hokkaido, as the first Ainu-themed national museum, nicknamed Upopoy or “singing together” in the Ainu language, will open in April. “We’ve never before had statues with such powerful Ainu characteristics,” Sato said. One statue featured a giant Blakiston’s fish owl spreading its wings watching over sculptures of the museum and a ship. The owl is considered a god in Ainu culture. Another statue was based on the Ainu myth of a thunder god and a forest princess. And some have been turning to the nature gods of Japan’s native Shinto religion to pray for more snow. In mid-January, a ski resort in western Hyogo prefecture invited a Shinto priest to hold a ceremony to ask the gods for snow, as did the organisers of the Yamagata snow festival in northern Japan. “It’s not that we don’t have enough snow. We don’t have snow at all. It’s serious and it’s a disaster,” Hyogo Governor Toshizo Ido told reporters last month. The Sapporo festival organisers hope they can continue the famed event in the future despite the warming climate. “This year marked the 71st event. It’s a festival that we want to carry on for future generations,” Sato said. “(But) this is about weather so all we can do is to pray.” (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.)"
" Two life-size lions crafted from scrap metal guard the entrance to the studio of Kenyan metal sculptor Kioko Mwitiki. Nearby a leopard, with holes in its metal body to mimic spots, crouches next to a giant elephant sculpture. Mwitiki, 56, estimates that he has sculpted thousands of tonnes of discarded metal -- from supermarket trolley wheels to shredded metal from factories -- into art over three decades. Customers for his artefacts, which can fetch up to $10,000 each, have included former U.S. president Bill Clinton, the Danish royal family, The Smithsonian museum in Washington and the San Diego Zoo. Mwitiki says his work is particularly relevant today due to global concerns about over-consumption, pollution and climate change. “Recycling has become a very important issue because you just need to be in sync with what is happening; all this plastic in the air, all this plastic in the ocean,” he told Reuters in his studio, where apprentices noisily beat and twisted metal. Sometimes his choice of material helps to draw attention to wildlife conservation, an issue close to his heart. For his lion sculptures, he transforms animal snares, used by illegal hunters in national parks and given to him by the Kenya Wildlife Service, into dramatic manes. Accidental Artist Mwitiki became an artist by accident. His elder sister sent him to be an apprentice in a welder’s shop as punishment after he was expelled from university in 1986 for joining anti-government protests on campus. In his spare time, he fashioned a few artistic objects from metal. He later found them displayed at a Nairobi gallery after a broker bought them cheaply from him and sold them on. This led him to realise he could support himself as an artist. Mwitiki’s childhood memories -- and concerns about growing conflict between humans and animals in his country -- inspired him to sculpt wildlife. He grew up south of Nairobi in the Rift Valley, where large herds of wildebeest once roamed the plains. “We literally had to go through a herd of wildebeest to get to school so these are things you can never forget.” Those migration routes have largely disappeared due to human encroachment on animal habitats. Mwitiki has trained younger artists, including two men from Malawi, who returned home to start similar recycling programmes. “We must teach the younger people to understand the importance of recycling because the resources that we have are in danger of being polluted,” he said.

" Last month was the warmest January on record globally, while in Europe temperatures were a balmy three degrees Celsius above the average January from 1981 to 2010, the European Union’s climate monitoring system reported Tuesday. Across a band of countries stretching from Norway to Russia, temperatures were an unprecedented 6C above the same 30-year benchmark, Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) reported in a statement. New temperature highs -- monthly, yearly, decadal -- have become commonplace due to the impact of climate change, caused mainly by the burning of fossil fuels, scientists say. The five last years have been the hottest on record, as was the ten-year period 2010-2019. 2019 -- the second warmest year -- was only 0.04C below 2016, when temperatures were boosted by a powerful El Nino, a periodic natural weather phenomenon over the Pacific Ocean. The global record last month was 0.03C above the preceding warmest January, also in 2016. For Europe, last month was “about 0.2C warmer than the previous warmest January in 2007, and 3.1C warmer than the average January in the period 1981-2010,” C3S reported. Records also tumbled in specific locations across the northern reaches of the continent. The village of Sunndalsora in western Norway, for example, hit 19C (66 Fahrenheit) on January 2, more than 25C above the monthly average, while the Swedish town of Orebro saw its warmest January day on the 9th since records began in 1858. Cross-country ski tracks were closed across large swathes of Norway and Sweden. Exceptional above-average temperatures extended over nearly all of Russia as well, and they were higher than normal over much of the United States, eastern Canada, Japan and parts of eastern China. Temperatures were likewise higher than normal in New South Wales in Australia, where massive bushfires devastated large areas of the state. Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 -- which causes global warming -- are now at their highest level in at least 800,000 years. The United Nations said last year that manmade greenhouse gas emissions needed to tumble 7.6 percent annually over the next decade to cap global warming at 1.5C above preindustrial levels, the aspirational goal set in the landmark Paris Agreement. Current pledges to cut emissions put Earth on a path of several degrees warming by the end of the century."
" A team of scientists from Florida State University in a recent study detailed on how significant weather swings increases the spread of flu epidemic in highly populated regions. The research which was published in the journal Environmental Research Letters shows that rapid weather variability as a result of climate change could increase the risk of a flu epidemic in some highly populated regions in the late 21st century. Zhaohua Wu, an associate professor in the Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science and an international team compared a few historical data to see how significant weather swings in the autumn months affect flu season in highly populated regions of northern-mid latitudes of the world. The team particularly looked at the United States, China, France, and Italy. According to previous research low temperatures and humidity in the winter create a favorable environment for transmitting the flu virus. In the 2017-2018 flu data, scientists found that the extreme fluctuations in weather during the autumn months essentially kick-started the flu. Wu said: “The historical flu data from different parts of the world showed that the spread of flu epidemic has been more closely tied to rapid weather variability, implying that the lapsed human immune system in winter caused by rapidly changing weather makes a person more susceptible to the flu virus.” The team is on the take that rapid weather variability is common in warming climates, and understanding these weather patterns may be a key to determine the severity of any future flu season threat.

" Last week was disappointing to Mumbaiites who want to save Aarey Milk Colony, one of the last expanses of unconstructed land in the city outside the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP). A committee appointed by the state government to look for an alternate site for the maintenance depot for the Colaba-Seepz Metro-3 underground corridor said that shifting the project from Aarey — where 33 hectares has been allotted for the depot — will lead to a spiraling of cost and delays. The committee suggested that the stay on construction — which was imposed after trees were cut at the construction site — should be lifted. The state’s new environment minister, who had lent his support to groups opposing the depot in Aarey, tried to save the embarrassment by saying that the findings of the committee were not final and that the government will take a final call on the site. Later in the week, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) disposed of an application that opposed the exclusion of parts of Aarey Milk Colony from the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) around SGNP. In December 2016, the ministry of environment, forest and climate change announced the creation of an ESZ ranging a minimum of 100 metres and a maximum of up to four kilometres from the boundary of SGNP. Aarey is on the southern boundary of SNGP and citizen’s groups were hoping that the creation of an ESZ would give Aarey protection. When the notification on the ESZ was released, they were appalled to know that the notification excluded 165 hectares (ha) of Aarey to allow construction, including the Metro-3 car shed. Environment group Vanashakti challenged the exclusion of the 165ha. When the NGT dismissed the petition, it killed hopes that some part of Aarey would get permanent protection. Recent studies have said that Aarey will not survive. A study by the Kamla Raheja Vidyanidhi Institute of Architecture and Environmental Studies (KRVIA), Mumbai, said that only 800 of 1,300 hectares of Aarey, originally allocated as ‘No Development Zone’ will remain as a ‘Green Zone’. Around 162 hectares will be lost for new projects. The study said that new projects located in the northern part of Aarey will cut it off from SGNP, depriving wild animals of their backyard. A former CEO of Aarey, who spoke to this newspaper, warned that the area could turn into a concrete jungle by 2030, with its wildlife disappearing. Aarey Milk Colony is spread over 3,160 acres (1,281 ha) which is owned by various government departments. A third of the land been leased or transferred to various government departments and institutions, including the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Board, State Reserve Police and Dadasaheb Phalke Chitranagari (Film City). The largest share of land is held by the dairy department. According to one estimate, forested areas, pastures, ponds and gardens cover around 1,740 ha. Recently, more sections of Aarey have been given for public housing, cemeteries and infrastructure projects. There are over two dozen tribal hamlets that predate the creation of the dairy. There are slums that have around 30,000 residents. In the past, environmental groups have failed to prove that Aarey was former forest land that should be restored to its original state. Vanshakti had approached the Bombay high court with documents that suggest Aarey is part of 2,076 ha marked as “unclassed forest’ in SGNP which was transferred to the forest department in 1969. Of this, 575 ha are to be kept aside for a recreational zone while the rest of the land was to remain a part of the national park. This could mean that the area has 1,500 ha of former forest land. The claim was rejected by the court in 2018."
" In a first, families travelling with women and children from Uttar Pradesh were caught red-handed in West Bengal on Saturday while smuggling around 650 endangered Indian soft-shell turtles. The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) of the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change and the West Bengal forest department personnel arrested 14 men and eight women, making it the biggest arrest in recent history. There were several children in the group that came to Bengal in the Purvanchal Express, posing as common travellers to evade suspicion. The train travels between Gorakhpur and Kolkata. “Some of the men were travelling with their wives; some had their mothers while a man was travelling with his sister-in-law. This is a completely new modus operandi adopted by carriers to evade detection,” said an officer from the raiding team who did not want to be named. “The families said they were to sell the turtles, which are considered a delicacy in parts of Bengal and Bangladesh, at Rs 300 a kilo,” the officer added. Agni Mitra, deputy director, WCCB (eastern region), said, “The arrests were made outside the Naihati station in North 24 Parganas district. The officers seized 645 live and 12 dead turtles. These were packed in travel bags. The turtles were taken to a rescue centre.” This was this year’s second big success for Operation Turtshield, a new Central programme to protect endangered turtles. On January 12, the officers seized 983 Indian flap-shell turtles and two Indian peacock soft-shell turtles from a market at Bongaon in North-24 Parganas. The latter figures in the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as ‘threatened species’."
            
        
" The government will release the Economic Survey for 2019-2020 on Friday, just a day before Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents Union Budget 2020. The Economic Survey is a comprehensive analysis of the Indian economy, including its growth and fall, in the past year. A team headed by the government’s chief economic advisor (CEA) prepares the report and releases it after approved by the finance minister. What is the Economic Survey? The Economic Survey reviews the country’s economic progress and issues faced in the past 12 months an outlines the government’s vision, its plan and the future outlook for the Indian economy. The annual survey of the Union finance ministry is the second most important document after the Union Budget. The Economic Survey details the performance of major developmental schemes introduced by the government and also highlights the performance of important government policies and their impact. It discusses the key fiscal developments, inflation, macroeconomic and other economic factors in detail, providing a concrete indicator for economic performance during the fiscal. The Economic Survey also talks about the impact of climate change, agriculture and employment on the country’s economy. The document is also expected to highlight some of the key economic challenges that led to a sharp fall in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in the current fiscal along with a roadmap aimed at recovery. What happens next? The report will be tabled in both Houses of Parliament by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman after which CEA Subramanian will discuss an economic roadmap for the next fiscal in a press conference. A day after, Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2020 in Parliament, which will account of the government’s finances and its estimated revenue and expenditure for the current and next fiscal year.

" Environmentalist and actor Dia Mirza has become a victim of social media trolls after she broke down at the latest edition of the Jaipur Literature Festival while speaking about climate change. A video is doing the rounds on the Internet in which the Rehnaa Hai Terre Dil Mein actor is seen weeping profusely. “Don’t hold back from being an empath. Don’t be afraid of shedding your tears..feel it.. feel the full extent of everything.It is good...it gives us strength...this is not a performance,” Dia said. She also refused to use a paper napkin offered by someone at a panel discussion. Replying to a few trolls, she wrote on Twitter, “Its called having a heart. Try it sometime. It makes you a part of the solution. #ClimateAction #ClimateEmergency.” She said in other tweets, “Our tears our own. But our actions can continue to bring more people together and its such a privilege” and “We must never hide the true extent of our feelings. Ever.” We must never hide the true extent of our feelings. Ever. https://t.co/ycsxhc2Fnv   Our tears our own.

Big love to you always https://t.co/NzfKSnsurb Dia’s words did not go down well with a section of netizens. They even trolled her by comparing her to teen environmental activist Greta Thunberg. “Meet Dia Mirza - Our Desi Sasti Greta Thunberg,” a user tweeted. Another one commented: “She should stuff her nostrils with wet cotton for five minutes. The earth could do with five minutes more oxygen.” One user even called her “dramebaaz”. Not only this, a slew of Twitter users reminded her how the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board had reportedly issued a red notice on her for not paying water taxes of Rs 2.26 lakh a few years ago. “If you are planning to be future environmentalist, use a lot of water, don’t pay the bill, so that after few years you can cry on TV saying you don’t use paper,” a user said.  Dia also thanked a fan who highlighted her efforts towards environment conservation. “I have never been afraid of expressing myself honestly and i hope everyone feels the full extent of what #ClimateChange is doing to people and planet. Solutions exist and we must acknowledge the problem so we can fix it.” Thank you Chinmay for caring truly with all your heart. I have never been afraid of expressing myself honestly and i hope everyone feels the full extent of what #ClimateChange is doing to people and planet. Solutions exist and we must acknowledge the problem so we can fix it. https://t.co/Xfwg2wM3WW When asked why she cried during the session, Dia shared that it was basketball legend Kobe Bryant’s death which made her emotional. “My day started really well yesterday (January 26). At around 3 (early morning), this news alert came on my phone for a very big player, NBA player who I followed for a while. His chopper crashing in California disturbed me. It really upset me. There are different things that upset us on different days, but we take care of ourselves. I was overwhelmed because my blood pressure was low,” Dia added. (With HT inputs)"
" The principal bench of National Green Tribunal (NGT) disposes the plea challenging the exclusion of parts of Aarey Milk Colony from the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) around Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP). The decision came as a surprise since the case was before the western, rather than principal, bench and was due to be heard in March. City-based non-governmental organisation (NGO) Vanshakti, which had filed the application, has said it will challenge the order in the Supreme Court (SC). On December 5, 2016, the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) announced the creation of an ESZ which ranged in width from 100 metres and four kilometres around the boundary of SGNP. The notification excluded 165 hectares (ha) of Aarey to allow construction, including the Metro-3 car-shed. Vanashakti challenged the declaration, alleging the final notification was different from the draft (circulated on January 22, 2016), which had no mention of 165ha being excluded. The NGO’s application also alleged the notification had arbitrarily excluded large parts of Aarey to facilitate construction in the area. On Friday, a bench headed by NGT chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel, with justice SP Wangdi and expert members Nagin Nanda and Siddhanta Das, disposed of the application stating the law has been followed while demarcating the ESZ. “In view of the above, no further order is necessary and the application is disposed of,” ruled the bench. Previously, on October 10, 2019, an NGT bench had asked MoEFCC to explain how the ESZ area was had been identified and why the 165 hectares (ha) was excluded. The ministry submitted its reply on December 12, 2019. The final order, issued on Friday, caught both applicants and respondents by surprise as the hearing of the case had been scheduled for March 3. On January 23, the NGT registry had informed both parties that the case would be heard before a bench headed by the NGT chairperson. “The order was passed without the presence of or hearing from any of the parties, despite being informed that it was wrongly listed before the principal bench when it is a matter for the western bench,” said Zaman Ali, counsel for applicants. Stalin D, director, Vanashakti, said, “The manner in which the entire episode was conducted does not inspire confidence in the judiciary.”"
" Imbibing a glass or two of your favourite wine could become a rare pastime unless growers swap grape varieties to adapt to climate change, researchers warned on Monday. Global warming of 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit), a realistic prospect this century, would threaten up to 85% of the world’s wine-growing regions - but planting different grape varieties or quantities could significantly cut losses, said a new study. The international team of scientists said their work highlighted “the critical role that human decisions play in building agricultural systems resilient to climate change”. The researchers looked at the climate suitability of 11 varieties of wine grapes, which account for a third of the area planted globally and are prominent in many important wine countries such as France, Australia, New Zealand and Chile. Switching to varieties that are more tolerant to heat could cut the loss of growing areas to 24% from 56% under average global temperature rise of 2C (3.6F) from preindustrial times, and to 58% from 85% with a 4C increase, they found. ALSO READ: Eight ways wine will change in 2020 In France’s Burgundy region, currently cultivated varieties like pinot noir could be replaced with the heat-loving mourvedre and grenache, they said. Cooler wine-growing regions such as Germany, New Zealand and the U.S. Pacific Northwest could also become suitable for grapes that thrive in warmer climes. But top producers Italy, Spain and Australia - which are already hot - face the largest losses, they added. Some big wine growers, particularly in Australia and California, also are facing losses of vineyards to worsening wildfires, as climate change brings hotter and drier conditions. John Handmer, a Canberra-based science advisor for the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, said recent bushfires in Australia meant some vineyards were not just damaged but “gone” - and could take years to re-establish. That would impact not only agricultural earnings - already hard-hit by drought in Australia - but also tourism in wine-growing areas, he added. Ignacio Morales-Castilla, lead author of the new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal, said the research showed there was still an opportunity to adapt viticulture and agriculture to climate pressures. “But we need to be aware that the more warming there is, the less chances we have to adapt,” said Morales-Castilla, from Spain’s University of Alcala. Diversifying into different grape varieties can help, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation - but once warming tops 2C, it becomes a less effective strategy the hotter the climate gets. The world has already warmed by just over 1C. In addition, vineyards must overcome regulatory, financial and cultural hurdles to switch varieties, warned the study. “There is attachment of some growers to given varieties that were grown (there) for centuries... and shifting or abandoning that variety is not going to be easy,” said Morales-Castilla. He said he hoped many more local varieties suitable for growing in hotter temperatures could be identified, as the study only looked at 11 varieties from a global total of about 1,100.

" It’s a problem that Davos can’t solve. The World Economic Forum tried to mitigate the environmental impact of all those private jets traveling to and from this year’s conference in the Swiss town by giving them the option to fill up on so-called sustainable aviation fuel, which is designed to lower carbon emissions compared to normal flights. Many attendees who left the conference after the last session on Friday will nevertheless have had to take commercial planes that use conventional fuel. Given the WEF’s effort this week to tackle the risks facing the world economy from climate change  — environmental issues topped its agenda for the first time in the event’s 50-year history — it’s an uncomfortable situation on its own doorstep. It’s also a high-profile example of an issue confronting the entire conference industry: as concern about environmental damage from air travel has given birth to a “flight shame” phenomenon which has darkened carriers’ outlook, there’s the potential for a knock-on impact on the business of organizing business meetings.  An average conference attendee emits as much as 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per meeting, according to TerraPass, a sustainability consultancy — about the same as driving from San Francisco to New York City. Some of the environmental impact comes from piles of brochures that might not get recycled, the food that gets wasted and the marketing swag that can end up in landfills. But the vast majority of carbon emissions come from air travel.  “We must get ahead of change and public perception,” Jason Geall, vice president for Northern Europe at American Express Global Business Travel, said in a speech to business travel and meetings executives in London on Monday. “A failure to act now could leave us vulnerable to existential threats, such as flight caps and increased taxation and regulation.” For now, environmental concerns haven’t hit events companies. Shares of Relx Plc, which derived about 18% of revenue from events in the first half of 2019, and Informa Plc, whose events unit contributed about 8%, were at or close to all-time highs on Friday.  UBS AG analysts led by Adam Berlin forecast 4% annual growth in the global exhibitions sector in the coming year, about the same pace as in recent years. While more organisers are recognising the need to mitigate the damage their events can cause to the environment, the industry hasn’t settled on an approach for tackling air travel. Some conference holders include carbon offsetting in the cost of the event tickets. Others leave attendees to address the problem themselves. Take MWC, the annual meeting for the telecommunications industry in Barcelona. This year’s event starts Feb. 24, and in 2019 more than 100,000 people attended. For four of the last five years, Guinness World Records named it “The World’s Largest Carbon Neutral Trade Show.”   MWC lists among its main achievements the creation of a green logo, and the use of recycled post-consumer bottles in the lanyards for attendees’ badges. Guests are also directed to a website where they can calculate and offset their emissions from attending the event, a spokeswoman said. The GSMA, the mobile industry lobby group that hosts the conference, calculates and offsets any emissions remaining, including from travel. Though the events industry has been slow to tackle the problem of CO2 emissions from air travel, images of the Australian wildfires and calls for action from activists like Greta Thunberg have sparked interest in making meetings more green, said Nancy Zavada, president of environmental consultancy MeetGreen in Portland, Oregon. Demand for her services, which includes helping meeting organizers arrange teleconferencing and carbon offsetting for attendees’ flights, jumped about 20% in the last quarter, she said. “The climate, the storms, the weather, are really starting to wake people up to what’s going on,” she said. “It’s also the Greta effect.” Marcia Balisciano, director of corporate responsibility at Relx, says it’s important not to underestimate the efficiencies that can be achieved by big business events. “If you come to this marketplace where your customers are going to be, or your suppliers, then it’s going to be a lot easier for you to do your business by traveling once,” she said.  MeetGreen’s president also cautions against being too quick to criticize the environmental measures taken at Davos. The WEF doesn’t serve drinks in single-use plastic containers, uses 100% renewable energy, and to encourage walking in the Alpine snow, offers shoe grips and maps. “They’re trying,” said Zavada. “They’re putting some stuff in place. They are just so public, they’re easy to pick on.” ©2020 Bloomberg L.P. (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.)"
" An athlete, hailing from Britain, became the first person to swim under an ice sheet in Antarctica. He navigated through the waters while wearing only swimming trunks, a cap, and goggles. Lewis Pugh, the 50-year-old swimmer, braved almost freezing waters of a supra-glacial lake and stayed in the water for over 10 minutes. However, it’s not the passion for creating a record which pushed Pugh to undertake the feat. He did it for a very different reason – to raise awareness about climate change. “I swam here in East Antarctica to bring you this message,” Pugh wrote on a Twitter post. “Having witnessed the rapid melting in this region, I have no doubt that we are now facing a climate emergency. At #COP26, world leaders need to step up or step aside. Time is running out. Please share,” he added. I swam here in East Antarctica to bring you this message:

He added that during the swim he came across varied hues of blue, from lightest to darkest. He also faced a risky situation when water of the lake suddenly started emptying through a crack. It would have meant water reaching the sea with Pugh in it. Luckily, “it was just the ice shifting” and he came out safely after completing his swim. Swimming under the Antarctic ice sheet is the most beautiful and terrifying swim I’ve ever done. Every shade of blue, and then nearly complete darkness. Mid-way I heard an almighty boom above me, and thought my time had come. Luckily, it was just the ice shifting. #Antarctica2020 Photo: @kelvintrautman "
" The United States’ financial chief on Thursday told Swedish teen Greta Thunberg to go study before calling for a fossil fuel halt, prompting the climate campaigner to reply it doesn’t “take a degree” to understand the science. The spat between US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Thunberg again highlighted the tensions over climate change at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, where governments have come under pressure to act on global warming as well as talk about the issue. German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday also said in a keynote address that governments were obliged to act on the younger generation’s concerns over climate change. Mnuchin had earlier advised Thunberg, who has been bitterly critical of US policy during her stay at Davos, to study economics before giving out lessons. Asked about the 17-year-old’s demand for an immediate halt to investment in fossil fuels, he told reporters: “After she goes and studies economics in college, she can come back and explain that to us.” But in a thread of tweets, Thunberg dismissed Mnuchin’s comments in a typically withering response. “My gap year ends in August, but it doesn’t take a college degree in economics to realise that our remaining 1.5 degrees carbon budget and ongoing fossil fuel subsidies and investments don’t add up,” she wrote. “So either you tell us how to achieve this mitigation or explain to future generations and those already affected by the climate emergency why we should abandon our climate commitments,” she added. In her speech to the forum, Merkel said that older politicians had to use the “positive manner and constructive impatience of young people”, who she said “have a completely different horizon” in terms of time. She did not however in her speech mention Thunberg, who other than Britain’s Prince Charles has met relatively few top leaders at the forum. - ‘We want this done now’ - In a speech on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump had castigated the “prophets of doom” and those that predicted a climate “apocalypse”, in comments widely seen as an attack on Thunberg who sat in the audience. But either by accident or design, there was no meeting between Trump and Thunberg before the US leader left the Swiss ski resort on Wednesday declaring he would have “loved” to have met the climate activist, Time magazine’s Person of the Year.

" The western monarch butterfly population wintering along California’s coast remains critically low for the second year in a row, a count by an environmental group released Thursday showed. The count of the orange-and-black insects by the Xerces Society, a nonprofit environmental organization that focuses on the conservation of invertebrates, recorded about 29,000 butterflies in its annual survey. That’s not much different than last year’s tally, when an all-time low 27,000 monarchs were counted. “We had hoped that the western monarch population would have rebounded at least modestly, but unfortunately it has not,” said Emma Pelton, a monarch conservation expert with the Xerces Society. By comparison, about 4.5 million monarch butterflies wintered in forested groves along the California coast in the 1980s. Scientists say the butterflies are at critically low levels in the Western United States due to the destruction of their milkweed habitat along their migratory route as housing expands into their territory and use of pesticides and herbicides increases. Researchers also have noted the effect of climate change. Along with farming, climate change is one of the main drivers of the monarch’s threatened extinction, disrupting an annual 3,000-mile (4828-kilometer) migration synched to springtime and the blossoming of wildflowers. Western monarch butterflies head south to California each winter, returning to the same sites and even the same trees where they cluster to keep warm. The monarchs generally arrive in California at the beginning of November and spread across the country once warmer weather arrives in March. On the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, another monarch butterfly population travels from southern Canada and the northeastern United States across thousands of miles to spend the winter in central Mexico. Mexican officials said last year the butterfly population wintering there was rebounding but they have not yet released this year’s count. A 2017 study by Washington State University researchers found the species likely will go extinct in the next few decades if nothing is done to save it. The monarch is now under government consideration for listing under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. The decision on whether the butterfly will be listed as threatened is expected by December. While helping the western butterflies could seem daunting, Pelton said the fact that the population didn’t shrink any further is encouraging. Pelton said people can help by planting early-blooming flowers and milkweed to fuel migrating monarchs on their paths to other states. The Xerces Society is working with the state of California to protect the butterflies’ wintering sites and develop new sites in state parks. “There are still thousands of monarchs (wintering) along the coast, so we can take heart that it’s not too late to act,” Pelton said.

" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday said that four looming threats endanger 21st-century progress and imperil 21st-century possibilities. “I see ‘four horsemen’ in our midst -- four looming threats that endanger 21st-century progress and imperil 21st-century possibilities,” Guterres said at the informal briefing of the UN General Assembly about UN work priorities for 2020, the Xinhau news agency reported. “Four horsemen” refer to four figures in the Book of Revelation who symbolize the evils to come at the end of the world. “The first horseman comes in the form of the highest global geostrategic tensions we have witnessed in years,” said the secretary-general. “Devastating conflicts continue to cause widespread misery. Terrorist attacks take a merciless toll. The nuclear menace is growing. More people have been forced from their homes by war and persecution than at any time since the Second World War. Tensions over trade and technology remain unresolved,” he said. “The risk of a Great Fracture is real,” the UN chief noted. “Second, we face an existential climate crisis,” he said. “Rising temperatures continue to melt records. The past decade was the hottest on record. Scientists tell us that ocean temperatures are now rising at the equivalent of five Hiroshima bombs a second,” he said. “One million species are in near-term danger of extinction. Our planet is burning,” he said. “Our world is edging closer to the point of no return.” “The third horseman is deep and growing global mistrust,” said Guterres. “Disquiet and discontent are churning societies from north to south. Each situation is unique, but everywhere frustration is filling the streets. More and more people are convinced globalization is not working for them,” said the secretary-general. “As one of our own reports revealed just yesterday, two of every three people live in countries where inequality has grown. Confidence in political establishments is going down. Young people are rising up. Women are rightly demanding equality and freedom from violence and discrimination. At the same time, fears and anxieties are spreading. Hostility against refugees and migrants is building,” he said. “Hatred is growing,” the UN chief noted. “The fourth threat is the dark side of the digital world,” he said. “Technological advances are moving faster than our ability to respond to - or even comprehend - them. Despite enormous benefits, new technologies are being abused to commit crimes, incite hate, fake information, oppress and exploit people and invade privacy,” he said. “We are not prepared for the profound impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution on the labor market and the very structure of society. Artificial intelligence is generating breathtaking capacities and alarming possibilities. Lethal autonomous weapons - machines with the power to kill on their own, without human judgement and accountability - are bringing us into unacceptable moral and political territory,” he added."
" The global economy has grown over the last decade at 3.2% per annum to $86 trillion in nominal terms. What has been markedly different in the last 10 years has been the dominant contribution of China to global growth. China’s contribution to global growth at 37.6% has, in fact, exceeded the contribution of the United States (US) at 30%. The size of the Chinese economy at $14 trillion is today 66% the size of the US economy. It is worth recounting that in 2000, Chinese GDP at $ 1.2 trillion was just 10% of US GDP. The full impact of the rise of China has begun to deeply influence not just the global economy and trade but also geopolitics, technology standards, sustainability and climate change, and the shift in consumption away from developed markets. The immediate positive development is the emergence of new consumption demand by the four billion new emerging markets consumers, many of whom are in China but also in India and Southeast Asia. By 2025, $30 trillion of demand will come from the consumers of emerging markets. These consumers have a middle-class mindset with high aspirations, and demand global quality in line with their newfound increase in wealth. However, their per capita income is lower than that of their counterparts in the West, and so companies need to re-craft their business models to be able to serve them effectively at a lower price point. In other ways, China’s rise comes with its challenges. Back in 450 BC, when the Greek historian Thucydides wrote that “it was the rise of Athens and the fear that this instilled in Sparta that made war inevitable”, he could have been writing about China and the US today. Dominant countries are always insecure about another rising power that could challenge them. The fast growth of China in the first decade of the 21 century was welcome, as it provided cheaper manufacturing locations and efficiently integrated global supply chains. The last decade has changed all that. Its continued dramatic rise has made it an economic giant. Its massive investments in technology and the manner in which it extracted intellectual property from foreign companies has made other countries resentful. Whatever the misgivings, China today is like a superpower in economic, military, nuclear, and most importantly, in its technological strength. With Donald Trump’s presidency, the underlying hostility in the US has been given expression. There is direct conflict in trade, contested geopolitical spheres of influence, and in deciding the underlying standards in modern technology. Trump has forcefully taken on the adverse terms of trade by imposing tariffs on China, and, more broadly, heralded a new nationalism with his America First policy. China, on its part, has always objected to its insignificance in the post-World War II institutional structure. To correct this, China has created new institutions that it can dominate — Asia Infrastructure & Investment Bank and New Development Bank — to challenge the US and European control of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. It has also asserted its newfound status in developing a more muscular foreign policy, with its best expression being the Belt and Road initiative. It is working hard to create its own sphere of influence. This clash is most apparent in the area of technology — Artificial Intelligence (data), quantum computing and cyber standards. What is making a compromise more difficult is the differing underlying beliefs and values underpinning this superpower rivalry. A clash between individual enterprise and public good, between privacy and State rights, and between checks and balances and authoritarian rule. This is making a search for acceptable global standards for data and its storage and use very difficult. The race in quantum computing, 5G and cyber is on, and is creating a fundamental challenge to rule-based institutions because of the disparate starting position of the two superpowers on underlying values. Splitting the world into two technology standards will be unfortunate, but the current path is headed that way. Global warming is another deep area of global concern. China’s rapid rise, which brought with it great improvements in its per capita income, taking millions out of poverty, was accompanied by accelerated CO2 emissions, making it one of the world’s worst polluters. Most developing countries had long argued that on their journey out of poverty, tight global environment standards should not be imposed as these did not exist when the current developed countries exited poverty. The problem is that with the US withdrawal from the Paris accord and Trump’s denial of the seriousness of climate change, the world is faced with a collective crisis. Our planet is already one degree hotter. On its current path, it will become three to four degrees hotter by 2100. That will seriously challenge how future generations live. It is clear that the world has lost its first battle against global warming and needs to adapt to living on a hotter planet, but if serious and urgent actions are not taken today, we may have an unlivable planet. In this new world order, what has caused most countries the greatest consternation is the desire of the US, under Trump, to vacate the global stage. Trump’s foreign policy has been unpredictable and shaken its former allies like South Korea and Europe when he has favoured deal making with North Korea and Russia over them. Trump believes that being a global superpower on a continuing basis does not serve the US well — it costs too much, the recipients do not appreciate the US, and it is not politically popular to send US troops abroad. He also believes bilateral deals serve US better than a multilateral system which can constrain it. Geopolitics has become both more important and more difficult between the assertive Chinese and the unpredictability and global retreat of the US. For most countries, including India, as Singapore’s PM Lee Hsien Loong says, “Choosing between the US and China will be painful.” Janmejaya Sinha is chairman, BCG India"
" US President Donald Trump and climate activist Greta Thunberg talked past each other in duelling speeches at Davos on Tuesday on the climate crisis facing the planet. Trump avoided the World Economic Forum’s key topic this year of climate change, beyond a dismissive reference to “alarmists” determined to “control every aspect of our lives”. Thunberg and three other young climate activists told gathering the world leaders are not doing enough to deal with the climate emergency and warned them that time was running out. “We must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse,” Trump told an audience that included Thunberg, adding that his stewardship of the booming US economy, spurred on by soaring oil and gas production, meant that “this is a time for optimism”. Thunberg, in typically uncompromising comments made at either end of Trump’s appearance, accused the elite Davos crowd of “empty words and promises” that amounted to doing nothing about climate change. Even if the anticipated Trump versus Greta rematch (after she scowled at him at the United Nations in New York) may not have quite materialised - neither mentioned the other by name, nor did they meet - their differences reflect equally entrenched sides of the climate debate. Only a handful of executives from the oil, gas and coal industries that are chiefly responsible for warming the planet were seen attending the panel at which Thunberg spoke, for example. Trump was greeted on arrival by giant letters etched in the Davos snow spelling out: “ACT ON CLIMATE.” Just as Trump was arriving in Davos, Thunberg said, “We need to start listening to the science, and treat this crisis with the importance it deserves.” Trump has pulled the U.S. out of the Paris accord to limit climate change and has traded barbs with Thunberg on social media. “Without treating it as a real crisis we cannot solve it,” Thunberg said. “It feels like the climate and environment is a hot topic now, thanks to young people pushing.”"
" Looking to transform the city’s eastern waterfront, the Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) wants to reduce the coastal regulation zone (CRZ) for areas under its purview to 100m from the high tide line, from the current 500m, on the grounds that the area “is fronting the bay and not the sea”. The MbPT plans to revamp the waterfront from Colaba to Haji Bunder, with commercial complexes, affordable housing, promenades and open spaces. According to the port authorities, the MbPT has sought modification in the draft Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) 2019 for Mumbai, which is currently open for public scrutiny. The proposal was discussed in the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority’s (MCZMA) meeting in December. The MCZMA will now refer the proposal to the Central government’s ministry of forest, environment and climate change. A senior planner from MbPT, who did not wish to be named, said, “The modification will certainly benefit MbPT in its eastern waterfront revamp. Right now, we are restricted as the CZMP maps wrongly defined the areas as part of the sea.” The MbPT has contended that according to a study by the department of ocean engineering, IIT Madras, the eastern waterfront abutting the MbPT land is a bay and not a sea. According to the new CRZ 2019 norms, development along a sea front is restricted to 500m from the high tide line and along the bay to 50m. It allows a floor space index (FSI) – ratio of developed area to the plot area – as per the regulations of the town planning authority for the area. The MbPT, which is a special planning authority for the eastern waterfront, had proposed a gross FSI varying between 1 and 4 for residential and commercial development in its draft proposal. It is under revision now. Gopal Chiplunkar, a member of the Practicing Engineers Architects and Town Planners Association, said, “The area between Colaba and Alibaug can be called a sea front, but the east coast is protected, it is where ship building and repair activities are undertaken, therefore, it cannot be classified as a sea front.” Chiplunkar has also filed an objection to the CZMP maps. “We have been objecting to defining these areas as sea for two years now,” another MbPT official said. MbPT has also stated that the Indira docks at Mazagaon and the other bunders (docks) are artificial water bodies that should not be considered as the basis to make the change."
" Hundreds of protesters calling on global leaders to take swifter action on climate change will face up to 5,000 military personnel and police from across Switzerland as they march to the ski resort of Davos for a planned demonstration. Greta Thunberg, the 17-year-old Swedish activist, is due to address the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) gathering of global business and political leaders, where U.S. President Donald Trump is the headline speaker. The 50th edition of the meeting sees the return of Trump after he pulled out in 2019. Fighter jets, ground defence systems and additional radar, among other measures, will protect some 3,000 participants at the meeting, Swiss police officials said on Monday. “Various people in the world are under great threat, if you can put it that way, and wherever they appear, they deserve commensurate security measures,” Walter Schlegel, the regional police commander, told a news conference on Monday. “The U.S. president has a big security detail that must be deployed,” Schlegel said. Trump is expected to attend on Tuesday and Wednesday, as hearings get under way in the U.S. Senate, where lawmakers are set to decide whether he should be removed from office. Activists are set to reach Davos by hiking trails and by train after authorities banned foot traffic on a road leading to Davos from the neighbouring village of Klosters."
" India and China must find equilibrium and understanding on key issues affecting their relationship because the two neighbours and emerging powers have no choice but to get along, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Wednesday. Speaking at the Raisina Dialogue, a think tank event backed by his ministry, Jaishankar said India hasn’t closed its doors to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and it is up to the other states involved in the free trade agreement to convince the country to sign on. He also described India as a “stabilising power” and not a “disruptionist power” on the world stage, and it shouldn’t be self-centred or mercantilist. India should be law-abiding and work for a rules-based order while using its capacities for global good, including as a net security provider and in dealing with challenges such as terrorism and climate change. Speaking on ties with China, Jaishankar said: “To my mind, it is absolutely necessary that the two countries find equilibrium and find accommodation and understanding on the key issues which affect each other. For me this is a must, it is not a choice.” Neither side can get the relationship wrong, he said, adding, “The reason is that we are neighbours. It is vital for neighbours to reach understandings as a general principle.” The India-China relationship is also unique because it is very rare to have two powers who are neighbours rising on the global stage in approximately the same timeframe, he said. The challenge for both sides is deciding the terms and the basis for reaching understanding on their differences and how this will work. “I would say it is a work in progress and it will be continue to be a work in progress,” he said. With India and China expected to be among the world’s top powers within a decade, “the logic of reaching an understanding will be a very, very powerful logic”, he said. Ties between China and India were hit by the military stand-off at Doklam in 2017, but they improved after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their first informal summit in Wuhan in 2018. The second informal summit was held in Mammallapuram last October. On the RCEP, Jaishankar said India pulled out of the trade deal being negotiated by the 10 Asean states and six trade partners last November as the offer made by the other countries didn’t meet India’s expectations. “Where RCEP is concerned, we have to look at cost and benefit. We will evaluate RCEP on its economic and trade merit. We have not closed our mind to it,” he said. The ball, he said, is in the court of the other countries involved in RCEP. India had pulled out of RCEP as its “core concerns” were unresolved and the proposed deal would impact the livelihoods of all citizens. RCEP states such as Japan have said efforts are being made to get India to join the trade deal likely to be signed in February. Though India has been a “prisoner of its past image”, it is now more of a decider and shaper than an abstainer, and this has been reflected in its work in areas such as connectivity and climate change, Jaishankar said. India is involved in 142 connectivity projects around the world, 53 of which were completed in the past five years. Answering a question on how the country is dealing with criticism over the actions in Kashmir and the new citizenship law, he said the key issue should be whether India is going to define itself or allow others to define it. “I would like to believe that it is the first. That is my political outlook and that of my party,” he said, adding it is important to see how India responds to common challenges faced by many countries. “Don’t get fixated on the dots and ignore the line. These are important issues. At the end of the day they reflect the mindset towards governance,” he said."
" The Union ministry of environment, forest, and climate change, whose mandate is to preserve India’s stressed natural wealth, has sought a reassessment of the sustainable mining plan for Saranda and Chaibasa forests in Jharkhand’s Singhum district. Critics suspect this is to facilitate mining. The Saranda forests are India’s largest, contiguous Sal forests spread over 82,000 hectares (ha). The current plan, which was prepared by the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education in 2018, said mining should not be allowed in the dense forest. It also said marked out a certain area in the periphery of the forests for mining, but recommended that very dense forests with canopy density above 70% be left untouched. Other than being a rich biodiverse forest and a huge carbon sink, Saranda is home to a large number of animal, bird and reptile species. While the forest is famous for sal trees, it is also rich in minor forest products. Marginalised tribal communities are also dependent on these forests. However, due to indiscriminate mining, Saranda has lost several plant and animal species."
" Most meat eaters admit veganism is ethical and good for the environment, researchers have found. The study, published in the journal Sustainability, looked at public opinion on plant-based diets and found widespread support for the ethics and environmental benefits of veganism and vegetarianism among meat-eaters. The findings from University of Bath, UK, suggest that 7 per cent of meat-eaters surveyed, considered veganism to be ‘ethical’, 70 per cent said it was good for the environment and half (50 per cent) considered it healthy and 60 per cent thought veganism was ‘acceptable’. “At a time of year when many people are considering switching to plant-based diets with ‘Veganuary’, this study shows that most people already agree with the ethics of veganism and are aware of the benefits of vegan diets to the environment,” said study researcher Chris Bryant from the University of Bath. The study, which involved 1,000 men and women with an average age of 34, was conducted in September 2018. Participants were recruited online through the survey platform Prolific. ALSO READ: Vegans are more vulnerable to bad hangovers. Here’s why By contrast, over 80 per cent of respondents thought veganism was not easy, 77 per cent thought it ‘inconvenient’ and over 60 per cent thought it was not enjoyable. Attitudes from respondents towards vegetarianism were significantly more positive on almost all counts. According to the researchers, this research is focused on shifting preferences away from animal consumption in view of climate change and reducing animal suffering. “Many people agree with the principles of veganism is one thing, but in terms of changing behaviours we need to acknowledge that for many it has been seen as too expensive, inconvenient and a sacrifice in terms of taste,” Bryant said. Interestingly, in the time since this study was conducted, these things have all changed substantially. Supermarkets, restaurants, and even fast food outlets have developed numerous high quality and affordable vegan options, the study said. “Having direct replacements for the foods people know and like makes it easier for everybody to consume fewer animal products,” Bryant said. “If we are to reduce animal product consumption in the UK and around the world, the development of high quality affordable alternatives to animal products is key,” Bryant added.

" Fresh off his win at the Golden Globes, actor Joaquin Phoenix participated in a climate change protest and was arrested by the police. The Joker star took part in the weekly protests against climate change, started by Hollywood veteran Jane Fonda. According to Variety, the 45-year-old actor also addressed the crowd of close to 300 people. In his short speech, he took aim at the meat and dairy industry for being the third leading cause of the climate crisis. “Sometimes we wonder what can we do in this fight against climate change, and there is something that you can do today and tomorrow, by making a choice about what you consume. There are things I can’t avoid. I flew a plane here today, or last night rather, but one thing I can do is change my eating habits,” Phoenix said. Also read: Tanhaji Vs Chhapaak box office collection day 1: Ajay Devgn film earns Rs 16 cr, Deepika Padukone movie lags at Rs 4.75 cr Besides Phoenix, veteran Hollywood star Martin Sheen also turned up for the protest and got arrested by the police. Actors Maggie Gyllenhaal and Susan Sarandon were also present. Capitol Police said it arrested 147 people who were charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding. All the protestors were later released. Fonda, who was on stage with Phoenix, called him “one of the greatest living actors today”. She has been protesting weekly as part of her “Fire Drill Fridays” initiative since announcing she was moving to Washington “to be closer to the epicentre of the fight for our climate.” Her participation has ended in multiple arrests. Earlier this month, Phoenix had talked about climate change at the Golden Globes ceremony, asking Hollywood to walk the talk on the issue.

" The year is 2100. The glaciers of the Hindu Kush-Himalayan region — the world’s “Third Pole” — are vanishing as the planet warms, the ice that once fed the great rivers of Asia is all but lost, and with it much of the water needed to nurture and grow a continent. Further stressed by extreme heatwaves, erratic monsoons, and pollution, the waterways are in crisis and the lives of hundreds of millions hang in the balance. Access to clean water, now more precious than oil, is a preserve of the rich and has become a resource so valuable that people — and nations — are willing to fight for it. This apocalyptic vision is the continent’s future if nothing is done to limit global warming, environmentalists warn. “If urgent climate action is not taken rapidly, starting today, and current emission trends continue, it is starting to look conceivable that this will entail grave threats to all of humanity as we know it,” says David Molden, director general of the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development. The 2015 Paris agreement saw nations commit to limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels as a way of curbing the worst impacts of global warming. A lower cap of 1.5C was set, only as a goal for nations to work towards. But this year’s Hindu Kush-Himalaya (HKH) Assessment Report says unless it is met -- two-thirds of the region’s glaciers will be lost by the end of the century. Running from Afghanistan to Myanmar, the HKH region takes in the Tibetan Plateau, and the Himalaya, Hindu Kush, and Karakoram mountain ranges. Functioning as a vast water tower, some of the world’s largest and most important rivers, including the Brahmaputra, Yangtze, Mekong and Indus, begin here. Its health is inextricably linked to that of the continent: Some 1.65 billion people directly rely on these waters — for their lives and livelihoods. But tens of millions more rely on the agriculture, hydropower, and industries the rivers fuel."
                
" The life we live today will set the foundation for how the next generation will live their lives. Our actions have an effect on this planet that we call home, and we need to be mindful of the consequences of living without consideration for the future. It is the need of the hour to cultivate a means of living that will enable future generations to live viably. To that end, awareness, in the form of environmental studies, can play a key role in ensuring that current and future generations can create a sustainable future. Environmental studies can be considered as a catalyst for change. It provides us with the knowledge to think critically and the power to understand the impact of our actions. But, are we doing enough to ensure that this information and knowledge is being imparted efficiently enough to empower the next generation? In an email interview to Hindustan Times, Lina Ashar, Founder of kangaroo kids and Billabong high speaks on the importance of making kids aware about the environment we live in and how to protect it and keep it healthy for the generations to come. 1) Why is it necessary for schools to introduce environmental studies? Environmental studies already exist. What we need now is the introduction of climate change and sustainability. Our world will implode if we don’t! The world is constantly changing and with it, so is the environment that students are growing up in. Recent examples like the smog in Delhi (with the Air Quality Index (AQI) reaching up to 463, is considered severe. A good AQI is between 0 to 50) and the floods in Venice (the worst in over 50 years) are a definite cause for worry. Our generation and previous generations have done very little to sustain a healthy environment and so now it has reached a stage of dire emergency. Our children will have no future if they have not been made aware of the challenges. The good thing is that with technology and creative education our children can redeem all the pain we have given Mother Earth. To educate for a sustainable future we need to shift ‘why’ we are educating our children. We can still create a sustainable future by shifting what we are doing in our schools. Genius ideas like robotic bees that can pollinate crops, the sea bin that can clean our oceans and the vegan bottle that replaces the plastic ones will happen if our education system moves away from content mastery and assessment to a system that embraces a solution seeking creative mindset. A system that moves away from the emphasis on the content driven academic curriculum. One that asks kids what world problem they are excited about solving, rather than one that asks them what they want to be when they grow up. We need students to gain the insight that is required for them to live sustainably, make better choices and work with nature. I firmly believe that if sustainability is inculcated during their childhood, it is likely to manifest in their future. 2) How can students differentiate between wants and needs and need and greed From very early years we can teach children the difference between wants and needs. When a toddler says ‘I need some chocolate’ is when the conversation needs to begin. A ‘need’ is essential for survival, for our existence. Everything else is a ‘want’. We have lots of activities and worksheets based on this. The quote by Mahatma Gandhi, “Earth provides enough to satisfy every man’s needs, but not every man’s greed” should extend to individual man and companies. One aspect of corporate greed our children should become mindful of is the planned obsolescence of products. Imagine a world in which we deliberately design technology products to fail prematurely or become out of date so that we consume more and more in order to increase the sales and revenues for these technology companies. Manufactures use digital locks and copyrighted software so that products become redundant faster! Students can be taught the difference between ‘wants and needs’ & ‘need and greed’ also through case studies that exemplify how corporate greed can manipulate the wants and needs of a customer. Our education efforts should go into encouraging an aptitude for ‘sustainability’, to transform students into conscious and mindful consumers who are considerate towards the planet. 3) How can we create a sustainable future for our kids today? In trying to prepare our kids for a sustainable future, we need to start taking action today. We need to be considerate of what we purchase, how we consume and the waste we generate in the process. We can change why and how we educate our children to embrace a sustainable-growth mindset.               "
" Six flagship programmes of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government lack capacity, awareness among stakeholders and compliance with measures related to the climate crisis and disaster management, according to a Union home ministry and UN Development Programme study. HT has reviewed a copy of the study titled Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation in the National Flagship Programmes. Its findings relate to the extent to which the schemes measure up to Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Change Adaption (CCA) considerations in terms of planning and whether they take have measures to address them. The flagship programmes reviewed in the study include Smart Cities Mission, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, Swachh Bharat Mission, Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) and the Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission. In its review of the Smart Cities Mission, the report noted disaster risk needs to be taken into consideration for designing project activities and to include necessary risk mitigation measures to address disaster risk/impact while designing and implementing redevelopment initiatives. “For example, while redeveloping the sewage system for a city, effective stormwater drainage needs to be considered as a critical component for managing urban flooding. Smart Cities Mission may consider taking up the issue of urban flooding as a priority and ensure that the infrastructure being added through the project helps in reducing this problem, as Smart Cities can only be smart if they are disaster-resilient,” it said. The Smart Cities Mission envisions developing within 100 cities model areas based on development plans that include application of smart solutions to involve the use of technology, information and data “High Tension (HT) Transmission Lines could be susceptible to damage during natural hazards viz high winds, cyclones, landslides, and earthquakes. Therefore, while setting up such HT lines, the hazard vulnerability profile of the local areas need to be considered and DRR on measures need to be integrated,” the study noted while referring to the DDUGJY DDUGJY is designed to provide continuous power supply to rural India. Its covers works like installation of HT transmission lines, new distribution transformers, relocation of distribution transformers, creation of new substations, distribution transformers and a high voltage distribution system. Infrastructure development could increase the exposure and vulnerability of people and assets if DRR measures are ignored, the report noted. “Poorly conceived development planning could induce new risks and amplify existing risks. For example, unplanned or haphazard urbanization could increase vulnerability to the built environment and may also aggravate urban flooding,” it said. The study notes there is a general agreement among experts that disaster risks are bound to increase in the coming decades on account of climate variability, climate crisis and environmental degradation. Disasters largely result from the failures of development policies and practices that distort the trajectories of sustainable development, affecting the poorest sections the most, it noted. “India has been experiencing a number of natural disasters particularly floods, cyclones, earthquakes and landslides due to its geographical location, size and rapid development. The government of India has been constantly working towards reducing the human, physical and economic losses caused due to disasters,’’ wrote Sanjiv Kumar Jindal, joint secretary, ministry of home affairs, in the report. “The events such as Phailin cyclone, 2013, and Fani cyclone, 2019, have demonstrated that over the time period, the mortality due to natural disasters have been reducing significantly; however, infrastructure and economic losses are still on rise.” He wrote mainstreaming DRR and CCA into development programmes is a key activity for reducing risk towards the new developments planned by the government. “It involves critically examining the government’s current or new development schemes from the perspective of reducing the exposure to the disasters and to minimise creation of potential new risk by incorporating suitable preventive measures.” The Disaster Management Act mandates the concerned ministries at national and state levels to prepare disaster management plans and integrate DRR elements in the ongoing schemes."
" The bushfires raging across Australia have had a devastating impact on the country’s unique flora and fauna, with some estimates putting the death toll at nearly half a billion animals in one state alone, and experts believe it could take decades for wildlife to recover. Unprecedented temperatures across the continent have made this season’s fires particularly deadly, killing at least 20 people and bringing apocalyptic scenes to an area roughly twice the size of Belgium. The crisis has focused attention on climate change, which scientists say is creating a longer and more intense bushfire season, and the Australian government has faced widespread criticism over its response and wider environmental policy. Harrowing footage of desperate koalas drinking from water bottles handed to them by rescuers and kangaroos standing helpless in fire-ravaged towns and charred forests have shocked people across the world. There is some hope, however, as experts believe scorched forests can recover in time, and decimated populations of koalas, kangaroos and other badly affected species may be able to return. ‘Could be billions’ A University of Sydney study estimates that 480 million animals have been killed in just the state of New South Wales (NSW) since September 2019, and according to a statement released Friday the authors said the “highly conservative” mortality calculations could mean the toll could be “substantially higher”. In order to reach the figure, the researchers cross-referenced estimates of mammal population density in NSW with areas of vegetation known to have been scorched to work out the death toll, which includes mammals, birds and reptiles, but not insects, bats or frogs. “The true loss of animal life is likely to be much higher than 480 million,” the statement said. “NSW’s wildlife is seriously threatened and under increasing pressure from a range of threats, including land clearing, exotic pests and climate change.” Professor Andrew Beattie from Macquarie University near Sydney told AFP he believes the death toll of animals nationwide could be in the billions, “if you think of mammals, and birds, and reptiles, amphibians and say the larger insects such as butterflies”. “We can be pretty sure that in large parts of these very expansive fires, most of the wildlife will be dead,” the emeritus professor from the department of biological sciences said. “The flora and fauna will be gone, and that includes the smaller animals which form the food chain for the bigger ones, which people often don’t think about.” Koala populations have been hit particularly hard because they live in trees, feed only on certain types of eucalypts and cannot move quick enough away from the flames. Even before this year’s bushfire crisis, numbers in NSW and Queensland had already dropped by 42 percent between 1990 and 2010, according to the federal threatened species scientific committee. The plight of the marsupial -- native to Australia -- has been raised in the country’s parliament, with Nature Conservation Council ecologist Mark Graham telling lawmakers: “The fires have burnt so hot and so fast that there has been significant mortality of animals in the trees, but there is such a big area now that is still on fire and still burning that we will probably never find the bodies.” ‘Lamentably slow’ reaction Previous studies have found that fires do not spread across the landscape uniformly, and some places are left unscathed even if areas around them are totally devastated. “It’s those areas that are untouched or have suffered less where wildlife tends to accumulate if they can get there,” Beattie told AFP, adding that if there are enough of these, the burnt forests should regenerate over time but only if conditions improve quickly. Asked if there was hope for the repopulation of animals in the worst-hit areas, Beattie said it depends on factors including rainfall, climate and logging, and it could take up to 40 years for habitats to return to normal.

" Leading linguists gathered on Friday to decide whether Americans over the past decade were most affected by movements to end racial or sexual violence, cultivate respect for gender fluidity or some other change - and how to sum it all up in one word or phrase. The American Dialect Society picks the Word of the Decade and Word of the Year at its annual meeting of university professors, grad students and word lovers of all ages, said Ben Zimmer, a linguist and lexicographer who heads the society’s New Words Committee. “People want to choose something that stands the test of time and sums up the decade as a whole,” said Zimmer, who writes a language column for the Wall Street Journal. Social media has turbo-charged the way words or phrases become popular, leading to some recent multi-word champions for Word of the Year, including ‘tender-age shelter’ in 2018 and ‘fake news’ in 2017. Decade nominees include: - #BlackLivesMatter: The hashtag used to protest alleged disparities in police use of force against African Americans. - Climate: Reflecting increased interest in the impact of climate change. - #MeToo: The movement that has highlighted widespread patterns of sexual abuse and harassment that women have faced at the hands of men across many spheres of life, including business, politics and entertainment. - They: When used as a gender-neutral singular pronoun, particularly as a nonbinary identifier. The society, founded in 1889 and dedicated to the study of the English language in North America, started selecting its “Word of the Year” in 1991 and since then has picked only two other Word of the Decade winners. Top choices were ‘web’ for the 1990s and Google as a verb for the 2000s. So far, Word of the Year nominations for 2019 include: - OK Boomer: Described as a retort to someone older who expresses views that are out-of-touch or condescending to young people and their concerns. - (My) pronouns: An introduction used for sharing one’s set of personal pronouns, for example ‘pronouns: she/her’. - Cancel: Meaning to withdraw support from someone or something that is considered problematic or unacceptable, used in the phrase ‘cancel culture’. - Karen: The stereotype of a complaining, self-important, demanding white woman, typically a member of Generation X or Generation Karen.

" “I’m not the kind of person who celebrates birthdays,” Greta Thunberg said as she turned 17 on Friday, marking the occasion in inimitable style - with a seven-hour hour protest outside the Swedish parliament. The climate activist braved winter conditions in her native Stockholm to continue the weekly Friday School Strike for the Climate campaign that helped catapult her to international fame. “I stand here striking from 8am until 3pm as usual ... then I’ll go home,” Thunberg, Time magazine’s Person of the Year for 2019, told Reuters. “I won’t have a birthday cake but we’ll have a dinner.” It’s been a busy 12 months for Thunberg, who crisscrossed the globe by car, train and boat - but not plane - to demand action on climate change. “It has been a strange and busy year, but also a great one because I have found something I want to do with my life and what I am doing is having an impact,” she said."
" Last month, Australia’s unprecedented wildfire crisis prompted Prime Minister Scott Morrison to cut short a vacation to Hawaii. It also abruptly ended his political honeymoon. Eight months after being lauded a conservative hero by engineering an unexpected victory, Morrison’s clumsy handling of the crisis -- highlighted by his trip to Hawaii just days after declaring a national disaster -- has stoked criticism over his political judgment, including by members of his own party. The prime minister was heckled on Thursday by angry residents when he visited the bushfire-hit town of Cobargo, where two people died earlier this week, while others declined to shake his hand and called for more resources to tackle the disaster. Speaking in a television interview from the fire-ravaged area on Friday, Andrew Constance, the transport minister for New South Wales state which is governed by Morrison’s Liberals, said the prime minister “probably deserved” his treatment the previous day. Australia’s unprecedented wildfire crisis has taken a huge toll: 19 people are dead and 28 missing, more than 1,000 houses burnt, and an area twice the size of Wales has been destroyed in one state alone. This week saw disturbing footage of thousands of holiday-makers huddled on beaches awaiting rescue, images that have fanned mounting concerns that Morrison’s pro-coal policies are hurting a nation that appears to be suffering the brunt of increasing climate change. “People are angry,” Morrison, 51, said in a radio interview on Friday when asked why he’d been heckled. “I understand the emotion, I understand the hurt, the anger, the frustration. What we will do is continue to use every resource and person we have to assist the situation.” Morrison’s response to the fires that have been burning for months appears similar to George W. Bush’s handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, according to Helen Pringle, a researcher at the University of New South Wales who writes about Australian politics. The disaster in New Orleans killed more than 1,000 people and caused an estimated $100 billion in damage. Bush was criticized for appearing to ignore the unfolding crisis while he was taking a vacation, and some political observers say his presidency never recovered. “Morrison’s messaging has really been off during this whole bushfire disaster,” Pringle said. “He seems to be downplaying it because if he admits to its severity then he understands more people will demand that he takes tougher action on climate change.” While there have been no opinion polls released in the past month to show whether the reputation of Morrison and his government have taken a real hit among voters, the reaction on social media has been savage. The hashtag #ScottyfromMarketing began trending, a reference to his stint as the former head of Tourism Australia and his inclination to put a positive spin on the crisis. A sign that Morrison was in danger of missing a change in the national mood came on New Year’s Day. Just 24 hours after thousands of people at coastal tourist spots were forced to flee fires that rained down ash and burning embers, he was promoting a cricket match in his home city of Sydney. People watching the game “will be encouraged by the spirit shown by Australians and the way that people have gone about remembering the terrible things that other Australians are dealing with at the moment,” he said. That same day he delivered a televised address telling Australians “there’s no better place to raise kids anywhere on the planet.” Last month, a New South Wales state lawmaker from Morrison’s own Liberal Party said the devastating conditions showed “doing nothing is not a solution” as scientists had warned that climate change would worsen the impact of fires. According to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald, former Liberal foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop used a pre-Christmas speech to about 150 members of the party to blast his decision to take an international holiday during the crisis. The criticism undercuts Morrison’s efforts to foster a “family dad” image that appeared to resonate with mainstream voters who were weary of the nation’s five changes of leadership since 2010. That underpinned his comeback win in the May election, garnering him praise from the likes of U.S. President Donald Trump. The prime minister has claimed the victory as a mandate for his entire policy agenda, including support for the coal industry -- Australia’s second-largest income generator after iron ore. Yet polls show a vast majority of Australians still want his government to take greater action to combat climate change. Morrison came under attack last month for enjoying a family holiday even as the severity of the wildfire crisis was becoming clear, with major cities such as Sydney and Canberra shrouded in smoke. His absence stood in contrast to Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese, who has used the spotlight while touring fire-ravaged areas to criticize the government’s lack of national strategy to combat the fires, as well as the absence of a mechanism that puts a price on carbon emissions. The Australian prime minister’s pro-coal industry government insists the nation is doing its bit to combat climate change, even while it opposes calls that would force polluters to pay for their carbon emissions. He told reporters on Thursday that regardless of the wildfire crisis, he won’t be changing his policies. He has also resisted calls to use a forecast budget surplus this fiscal year to bolster a stalling economy. A passionate backer of the fossil-fuel industries that still provide the bulk of the nation’s electricity, Morrison claims Australia is meeting its international emissions reduction commitments. Still, his opponents say such targets don’t include the massive amounts of coal burned after it’s shipped to countries such as India and China. They also say his claim that the nation is responsible for 1.3% of global emissions can be contrasted with Australia having just 0.3% of the world’s population."
" Any project involving the destruction of forests may soon be able to meet the compensatory afforestation target it has to meet by simply buying ready-made plantations, if a controversial plan being considered by the environment ministry is finalised. The ministry plans to overhaul the compensatory afforestation process by accrediting private or public-private partnership companies to raise plantations near reserved forests that can be bought by developers of projects involving diversion of forest land. The proposal has been accepted in principle by the Forest Advisory Committee of the environment ministry according to minutes of a FAC meeting held on December 19. But experts warned that such a scheme would lead to commoditisation of precious forest land. Under the Forest Conservation Act 1980, every time forest land is diverted for non-forest purposes such as mining or industry, the project developer is supposed to identify non-forest land of an equal area and also pay for planting forests over this, or when that is not available, on twice the area of degraded forest land. This money presently gets collected under the compensatory afforestation fund. But, the minutes suggest that the ministry is mooting a revamp of this scheme with a so-called “Green Credit Scheme.” The reasons given by the ministry for this revamp include delays in accessing compensatory afforestation funds to raise plantations; the fact that land made available by project developers for afforestation is often far away from the place where the diversion has taken place; cost over-runs for projects; and plantations often don’t have a good survival rate. To address these issues, the green credit system proposes that any agency interested in raising plantations can apply for accreditation by the environment ministry. The plantation will be eligible for compensatory afforestation three years after it has been raised if it meets a “predetermined criteria of success.” This plantation can then be traded with the project developer and the price negotiated between the company raising the plantation and the developer. If the company raising the plantation doesn’t wish to trade, it can retain it and harvest the timber once ready. “In the larger context, this will hasten afforestation work and also carbon sequestration to address the concerns of climate change,” the proposal states, as recorded in the meeting’s minutes. The proposal also states that wood apple, neem, eucalyptus, ficus, prosopis cineraria or khijdo and a few other species will be preferred for such plantations. “The proposed scheme is regressive in its design and approach. The failure of compensatory afforestation has been turned into an opportunity to create plantations plots that can be traded by user agencies seeking forest land diversion. It has no ecological sensibility or livelihood sensitivity. More than ever before forest land will be a commodity for a business scheme, where it is purchased in advance and sold in future,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research. “This proposal also runs the risk of plantations being raised onmulti-use land, turning them private forest enclosures. This will restrict access of forest dependent or pastoral communities on lands forest rights may historically persist and their final legal recognition may still be under contest,” she added. Siddhanta Das, former director general of forests who retired last month declined to comment on the issue saying “since I am not in the ministry anymore its not appropriate that I comment.” Anjan Mohanty, inspector general of forests didn’t respond to queries. “We are seeing that more and more forest land is being used for compensatory afforestation instead of non-forest land. The ministry is diverting degraded forest land or revenue forests for afforestation which is very worrying. Now this new proposal of opening up forests to the private sector will lead to commercialisation of forests in violation of forest laws,” said Tushar Dash, member of Community Forest Rights—learning and advocacy group."
                
" Among all union territories, Chandigarh has shown the highest increase in forest covered area in the past two years. It has gone up by 2% from 21.56 to 22.03 sq km . This is as per the data released by the central government’s ministry of environment and climate change in the India State Forest Report (ISFR), 2019, on Monday. The ministry releases the data every two years. As per the report, there is an increase in the areas covered under moderately dense and open forests. There is no increase in the very dense forest area. The total increase of 0.47 square km. Other UTs, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu and Lakshadweep have shown no change in the area covered by forests . As per the report, Delhi and Andaman and Nicobar have shown an increase in forest area by 1.5% and 0.1% compared to 2017. The data also reveals a total increase in green cover from 41 to 46%. This also includes areas other than forests. Chief conservator of forest, Debinder Dalie said, “Proactive action has been taken by the Chandigarh administration and the residents which has helped increase the total area under green cover.” Chandigarh is the fifth largest union territory covering an area of 114 sq km. Based on the digital interpretation of satellite data recorded in October, 22.03 sq km in Chandigarh is under forest cover which is 19.32 % of it’s geographical area. As per the Chandigarh greening action plan, three combined agencies celebrated Van Mahotsav in June.
This year, the forest department has planted 65,000 saplings and the horticulture wing of the engineering department around 22,000 saplings. The target given to the civic body was 40,000. "
" The father of Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish environment activist, has said that she “changed” and has become “very happy” as a result of her activism that has contributed towards a global movement demanding world leaders to take action over climate change. In an interview with the BBC, Svante Thunberg said: “You think she’s not ordinary now because she’s special, and she’s very famous, and all these things. But to me she’s now an ordinary child - she can do all the things like other people can. “She dances around, she laughs a lot, we have a lot of fun - and she’s in a very good place.” Speaking to the BBC, Svante Thunberg said that his daughter had struggled with depression for “three or four years” before she began her school strike. “She stopped talking... she stopped going to school,” he said, adding that it was the “ultimate nightmare for a parent” when Greta began refusing to eat. To help her get better, Svante Thunberg spent more time with Greta and her younger sister, Beata, at their home in Sweden. Greta’s mother, opera singer and former Eurovision Song Contest participant Malena Ernman, cancelled contracts so the whole family could be together. Over the next few years they began discussing and researching climate change, with Greta becoming increasingly passionate about tackling the issue. Svante Thunberg has accompanied Greta on her sailing expeditions to the UN climate summits in New York and Madrid. She refuses to travel by air because of its environmental impact. “I did all these things, I knew they were the right thing to do... but I didn’t do it to save the climate, I did it to save my child,” he told the BBC. Greta was nominated for this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, after spearheading the global movement, which also led to co-ordinated school strikes across the globe."
" It has been a trend seen since the 1980s -- each decade has been warmer than the previous one. The past decade has been the warmest ever on record. And 2019 is expected to be the second or third warmest year ever. That’s the toll climate change is taking on the world. A graph in a provisional statement released this month by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) captured how climate change’s impact on warming is unprecedented. Average carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations reached 407.8 parts per million in 2018 and 410 ppm in November 2019, according to data from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas said it was worth recalling that the last time earth had experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was three to 5 million years ago, hinting that the world couldn’t even begin to imagine the impact of such large concentrations. Climate change has indubitably stamped its signature on the world’s oceans, the atmosphere.and the cryosphere -- the frozen water part of Earth. Sea water is 26% more acidic than it was in pre-industrial times, ocean heat is at record levels, causing strong marine heat waves and leaving an irreversible impact on marine ecology, according to WMO. The Arctic Report Card for 2019 by NOAA also warned that the average annual land surface air temperature in the Arctic between October 2018 and August 2019 had been the second warmest since 1900. The Arctic sea ice extent at the end of summer 2019 was the second lowest since satellite observations began in 1979. Loss of sea ice and changes in bottom water temperature caused Arctic fish species to shift to more northern waters. The global mean sea level rise increased from 3.04 millimeters per year (mm/yr) in 1997 to 2006 to 4 mm/yr during 2007-2016, according to the UN Science Advisory Committee. These trends show that the planet’s adaptive capacity is being challenged. “Our three special reports on warming of 1.5°C, climate change and the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate indicated that the impacts of current warming are much more severe than previously understood: e.g. accelerating sea level rise and ocean warming, some key ecosystems becoming much more vulnerable, and increasing risks of reaching limits to adaptation,” Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) chair, Hoesung Lee said in Madrid recently. IPCC’s land report said land surface temperature had already increased by 1.53 degrees C since the pre-industrial period. IPCC had warned earlier that a global mean temperature rise --land and oceans combined -- of 1.5 degrees C can trigger dangerous climate change impact. Perfect Recipe for Disasters IPCC’s ocean and cryosphere report released in November warned that oceans had been affected by “unprecedented” conditions and that extreme sea level events, which are historically rare, are occurring once per century; their frequency is projected to increase to at least once a year in many locations, particularly the tropical regions, by 2050. “Until now we have been looking at individual extreme events- say for example heavy rainfall events or sea level rise or cyclones. The recent IPCC reports show that these events are going to co-occur, at higher intensities, if the current rate of carbon emissions and human activities are to continue. Signs of that are already at our doorsteps, where both global and local changes are brewing the perfect recipe for disasters. We might be able to mitigate these impacts at least partially, by acting locally,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, scientist at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune.

" The maximum temperature recorded in the city on Thursday was 9.8°C, making it the coldest December day since 2014. This was the day temperature, which plunged to 6.4°C by the evening.  But, this was not the only record broken in this season as on Wednesday, the city had shivered at 8.6°C, which the PAU school of climate change called coldest in last 50 years. There was no respite from freezing cold conditions on Thursday as strong winds, especially during the evening, added to the woes of people.  As per Dr KK Gill, professor of agricultural meteorology, it was not an unusual phenomenon. “Of late, the month of December has been sunny as compared to January, when colder conditions prevail. This year, the process has come in advance, largely due to western disturbance and snowfall at higher reaches. During the 70s, the cold wave use to hit the region during December, but in the past couple of decades, we have witnessed January being the coldest,” Prof Gill said.  As per the data shared by PAU, the lowest temperature December witnessed was 17.4°C in 2018, 14.5°C in 2017, 17.6°C in 2016, 17°C in 2015, 9°C in 2014 and 12.8°C in 2013. According to senior medical officer (SMO) Avinash Jindal, no more deaths due to cold were reported either on Wednesday or Thursday.   However, the civic body swung into action a day after it was highlighted that 10 people have succumbed to cold wave."
" As 2019 comes to a close we take a look at four things that broke the internet from teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg to a number of online challenges. The list is both varied and interesting. 1. Bottle Cap Challenge The bottle cap challenge, believed to have been started by Taekwondo instructor Farabi Davletchin, went viral on social media after actors, politicians and fitness addicts took it up. In this challenge, a bottle needs to be placed on a hard surface, like a table or floor, and the cap of the bottle should be loosely screwed. The person taking up the challenge has to unscrew the cap of the bottle with a roundhouse kick. The challenge is only successfully complete after the cap flies off, while the bottle remains static. The entire process has to be recorded in slow motion video, so that one knows if they had made it or not. The challenge in India was taken up by Bollywood stars like Akshay Kumar, Govinda, Parineeti Chopra, Susmita Sen, Tiger Shroff among others. All these celebrities shared the video of the challenge taken on social media.   Sidoooo this is my version! 🤣🤣🌈 @sidmalhotra #BottleCapChallenge #KHADKEGLASSY OUT NOW! A post shared by Parineeti Chopra (@parineetichopra) on Jul 5, 2019 at 7:06am PDT   Why should boys have all the fun!!!😉👊 Renee, Alisah #yourstruly & @rohmanshawl all in😎😄❤️ #bottlecapchallenge #superfun #familytime #dubai #challengeaccepted 😉💋 I love you guys!!! #familybottlecapchallenge 💃🏻 A post shared by Sushmita Sen (@sushmitasen47) on Jul 4, 2019 at 12:20pm PDT Kiren Rijiju, Union minister for youth affairs and sports, too showcased his fitness through the challenge. In his video post on the bottle cap challenge, Rijiju also send out a message against drugs. “Say no to drugs. Get ready for Fit India Campaign,” he wrote on Instagram. 2. Greta Thunberg Swedish teen Greta Thunberg has become the face in the fight against climate change. Thunberg became internet’s hero after her ‘How dare you?’ speech at the United Nations Climate Summit in New York in September this year. In her speech at the UN climate summit, a visibly angry Thunberg accused world leaders of not doing enough to tackle climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. “How dare you?” she asked world leaders. The 16-year-old, who has taken a year off from her studies, said. “This is all wrong. I shouldn’t be up here. I should be back at school on the other side of the ocean.” US president Donald Trump mocked Thunberg for her comments at the UN summit. “She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!” Trump had tweeted. Thunberg was named Time Magazine’s Person of the Year for 2019 this week. She is the youngest person ever to receive the honour. Trump tweeted to say that it was “ridiculous”. “Greta must work on her anger management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!” he tweeted. Thunberg did hit back at the US president- “A teenager working on her anger management problem,” read her Twitter bio. 3. Kiki Challenge Kiki challenge is a dance challenge went viral across the globe. It is based on Canadian hip-hop star Drake’s song “In My Feelings” from his album Scorpion. In order to complete this challenge, the participant has to step out of a moving car, perform the dance while the car is moving and then again get into the car, without injuring themselves. People attempting this challenge in India got injured and quite a few incidents were reported from Delhi, Mumbai, Chandigarh, Bengaluru, Jaipur and other cities. Enforcement agencies in India too issued advisories against attempting the challenge. 4. Hum Fit Toh India Fit challenge The challenge was started by Union Minister and Olympic medallist Rajyavardhan Rathore as an attempt to make the country fitter. As a part of this challenge, the person has to record a video of him or her working out or exercising. The challenge went viral within three days. Union minister Kiren Rijiju, Indian cricket team captain Virat Kohli also took it up. Virat Kohli tagged Prime Minister Narendra Modi who accepted the challenge and posted a video showing him stretching and doing several yoga poses. Politicians, actors, sportspersons and general public shared their videos. Bollywood stars such as Salman Khan, Deepika Padukone and Hrithik Roshan took up the challenge.   Fabulous campaign by sports minister #RajyavardhanRathore on #HumFitTohIndiaFit. I accept #FitnessChallenge of #KirenRijiju 🙏. Here is my video ...

" At the World Economic Forum 2018 meeting in Davos, Prime Minister Narendra Modi identified climate change as one of the major challenges to civilisation. He said, “ We are exploiting nature for our greed today. We need to ask ourselves if this is our progress or regression”. The consequences of climate change are beginning to show. Unplanned development; irresponsible exploitation of natural resources leading to indiscriminate industrialisation, urbanisation, and deforestation; and unscientific changes in land-use patterns have resulted in increasing emissions of greenhouse gases. To me, sustainability and sustainable development are all about a fine balancing act between our competing needs and our desire to progress with a focus on protecting the environment. It is our collective responsibility towards our future generations to build a sustainable lifestyle. Ancient Indian philosophy has always stressed on the uniquely human connection between the divine and nature. Almost all our religious texts like the Mahabharat, Ramayan, Vedas, Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita speak of the need to treat nature in an ethical manner. Sustainability refers to the continuity of the world for the next generation with regard to its social, environmental and economic dimensions. Sustainability, as an interdisciplinary concept, regards sustainable development as development that meets the needs of the present, without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. We need to teach our students that sustainability is all about maintaining continuity. Education is vital to understanding sustainable development. In the new education policy, we have focused on an eco–social approach to learning with due weightage to value-based education. It’s important that education should not only be sustainable and comprehensive, but must also evolve on a continuous basis to meet the challenges posed by a dynamic environment in order to make our evolution more pragmatic. We’re reaching a critical juncture in the field of sustainable development. The world’s population has witnessed unprecedented growth in the past century. Today we are more than 7.6 billion and the number is still growing. This rapid growth brings with it several policy challenges. However, the good news is that by the next year, India will become one of the youngest countries in the world with 64% of its population in the active working group. Accompanied with major demographic shifts resulting from rising life expectancy and falling fertility, India’s current population is more than 1.3 billion. By 2050, it will be 1.6 billion, making it one of the youngest nations in world. It is now estimated that in another five-six years, we will most likely surpass China to become the most populous country on the earth with more than 1.4 billion people. The fact that India represents one-sixth of humanity places additional responsibility on us. With the new education policy, we are ensuring that it connects well to the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goal on education and other related goals such as building an inclusive society. We must keep in mind the fact that India occupies less than 2.5% of the world’s surface and sustains a whopping 18% of the world’s population. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has warned that by 2025, 1.8 billion people will be inhabiting regions with absolute water scarcity. We will also witness a shortage of food, minerals, and natural resources. The earth can sustain many more billions, provided all those people make logical decisions and choices regarding resource production and consumption. How do we achieve this? We have to convince individuals, families, organisations, policymakers, elected representatives and governments to make the right choices. We must understand that the power of education within the context of sustainable development is enormous. This issue was given centrestage when the United Nations General Assembly declared the United Nations Decade on Education for Sustainable Development from 2005 to 2014. The good part was that this decade helped nations realise that education is an indispensable input to achieving sustainable development."
" Inspired by some of the top headlines of 2019, we present our annual ho ho ho… ‘Just over a decade is all that remains to stop irreversible damage from climate change’ Climate Change                                                                                "
" Removing encroachments along the national highways in the state seems to be an uphill task for the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) even as the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has issued directions in this regard. The NGT had directed the NHAI that the area along both sides of the highways should be used to maintain the green cover. According to a report submitted by the NHAI, most encroachments were reported on NH 10, NH 44 and NH 73 in Panipat, Rohtak, Yamunanagar and Hisar districts. The NHAI found 236 encroachments on the 58km stretch along the Rohtak-Hisar national highway in the NCR, followed by 153 encroachments on Delhi-Ambala NH 44 and 80 encroachments were reported on Yamunanagar-Barwala-Panchkula NH 73. These encroachments were in violation of Section 15 of the NGT Act, 2010, which ensures mandatory green cover on both sides of highways. Most encroachments, including roadside dhabas, hotels, restaurants, shops, tea-stalls, even residential, commercial and religious buildings, are permanent and have been present for past several years. However, as per the report, the NHAI has mentioned that a task force has been created for the removal of encroachments and is actively working on it. In its December 3 orders, the principal bench of the NGT led by chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel had observed that steps taken for the maintenance of green belts on both sides of the highways and for removing encroachments were not adequate in absence of effective institutional mechanism to monitor compliance of such norms. The NGT had asked the NHAI to file further affidavit giving complete information about the extent of encroachment on national highways, action plan for removal of such encroachments, extent of plantations before the next date of hearing, which is fixed as February 28, 2020. “Information should also be provided in a cumulative manner on quarterly basis for last one year on state-wise numbers and extent of encroachments, and those removed in the quarter for last one year,” the bench had observed. The NGT had directed the ministry of environment, forest and climate change to make an effective monitoring mechanism for ensuring the maintenance of green belts on both sides of all highways for controlling air pollution. Meanwhile, the NHAI officials seem reluctant to comment on why the NHAI failed to remove the encroachments along the national highways in compliance of NGT orders. Vishal Gupta, chief general manager, NHAI (Chandigarh region) said, “Our project directors have taken up the issue with concerned district administrations. We need to talk to the project directors regarding the action being taken to remove the encroachments. If required, we will take up the issue with the state government.”"
" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday dismissed calls from Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg to take more action on climate change amid a devastating bushfire crisis in his country. When asked about a social media post of Thunberg related to the bushfires, Morrison said that he would remain focused on Australia’s interests, Xinhua reported. “Australia and the Australian government will set our policies based on Australia’s national interests, on what Australia needs to do,” Morrison told reporters while visiting evacuees in the state of New South Wales. “That’s where I keep my focus. It’s not for me to make commentaries on what those outside of Australia think that Australia should do,” he added. On Sunday, the 16-year-old Swedish activist posted on social media accompanied by a news story regarding the Australian fires -- “not even catastrophes like these seem to bring any political action. How is this possible?” “Because we still fail to make the connection between the climate crisis and increased extreme weather events and natural disasters like the #Australia Fires,” she said. The post garnered over 160,000 likes and more than 50,000 shares and sparked heated discussion online. Without directly referring to Thunberg, Morrison remained staunchly committed to his defence of balancing climate concerns with that of the national economy. “I’m not here to try to impress people overseas,” he said. “I’m here to do the right job for Australians and put them first, and that means putting the environment in which we live at the top of the agenda, along with the economy in which people live at the top of the agenda.”"
                                 
" India has managed to protect its interests at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP25) in Madrid last week, environment minister, Prakash Javadekar said on Friday. Indian negotiators have pushed for carryover of millions of unsold carbon credits from clean development mechanism (CDM) under Kyoto Protocol to the new carbon markets to be developed after 2020 which can yield a benefit of nearly ₹5,000 crore to industries holding these credits, Javadekar added. The climate talks have largely been labelled to be “disappointing” and “unfortunate” by the small and vulnerable countries and civil society organisations because it failed to build consensus on key issues for meeting the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global mean temperature rise under 2 degree C. There was no agreement on how new carbon markets covered under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement would shape up; no progress on compensation for climate change induced “loss and damage” to vulnerable countries and most developed countries didn’t commit to enhance their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) by 2020. “I am disappointed with the results of #COP25. The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation & finance to tackle the climate crisis. But we must not give up, and I will not give up,” UN secretary general Antonio Guterres had tweeted. But India is hopeful that there will be resolution on issues which matter to the country at the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to be held in Glasgow next year. Javadekar also said that some countries also pushed for not counting of credits once they are sold to another country, also called corresponding adjustments in climate negotiation terminology. This essentially means when one country sells emissions reductions to another, it must adjust its own emissions data accordingly so that there is a real reduction in emissions. Civil society organisations have also linked double counting of credits as an issue which could jeopardize environmental integrity of carbon markets. Carbon markets trade in emission reduction credits. For example, if two countries are required to achieve a certain carbon emission target and one has over-achieved the target while the other hasn’t managed to meet its target, the country with more reductions can sell carbon credits to the other. “We haven’t agreed to the issue of corresponding adjustments. It will be discussed again next year,” Javadekar added. He said India has been together with like-minded developing countries (LMDCs) and the Brazil, South Africa, India and China (BASIC) groups during the negotiations. It will have several meetings with these two groups before deciding on what will its stand be at COP26 when parties are expected to update their NDCs in line with the Paris Agreement. The COP25 decision provides for assessing the gaps in commitments delivered by the developed countries in the pre-2020 period. The developed countries have time till 2022 to deliver on these. “Developed world promised 1 trillion dollars in the last ten years and not even 2% of that has materialised. We will push for these commitments to be met,” Javadekar said."
" From its colonial trading days to reclaiming land from the sea, the Netherlands has a tradition of pushing the limits, but a public backlash over a planned airport suggests that many Dutch have had enough. With the opening of a second Amsterdam hub delayed by 20 months and counting, political fronts are hardening ahead of a crucial environmental-impact report expected in January. At the center of the dispute is whether the project is justifiable for a country of 17 million people, which already has some of the most intense land use in the world. Amid concerns over climate change and the emergence of flight-shaming, the issue is straining Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s complex four-party coalition. The Christian Union, the smallest group in the government, has raised the prospect of opposing the opening of Lelystad airport, located on reclaimed land 40 miles east of Amsterdam. “The Christian Union is not against aviation, but against nuisance for local residents and damage to the environment,” said Eppo Bruins, a lawmaker for the party. “We can only determine whether the airport can be opened if all information is on the table.” The 160 million-euro project ($178 million) -- backed by Rutte’s VVD party -- would add dozens of daily flights to the Amsterdam area. That could free space for KLM to continue international expansion at the city’s Schiphol hub, which has reached government-imposed capacity limits. A process of national soul-searching began after the plan suffered its first of three delays in April 2018. The latest hurdle is the risk to local eco-systems posed by nitrogen-oxide pollution from airplane exhaust. An independent government-appointed commission will deliver its verdict early next year, with the report likely to set off political wrangling in the run-up to elections in early 2021. “It’s sheer madness to facilitate a new airport in times of climate urgency,” said Suzanne Kroeger, a member of parliament for the environmentalist GroenLinks party, which is in the opposition. “Lelystad will be a failure.” As Schiphol passengers jostle through crowded terminals and planes queue up for takeoff amid the Christmas travel crush, Lelystad remains a ghost airport. The converted general-aviation airfield has traffic controllers, custom checks and kiss-and-ride parking signs, but no passengers. On a recent December day, the tarmac was occupied only by a small propeller plane, while a few construction workers performed minor work at the facility, which would still need months to open if and when it gets approval. The airport operator declined requests for an interview and a tour of the facility. The nearby city of Lelystad is hoping the situation changes soon. The capital of the province of Flevoland sits on land reclaimed in the 1950s and is keen on attracting business to the isolated area. “Lelystad has a cyclically sensitive economy,” said Janneke Sparreboom, the city official in charge of economic affairs. “The opening of the airport will make it more robust: more employment, more people coming to live.” National interests are tied to the site becoming a landing pad for low-cost carriers such as EasyJet Plc and Ryanair Holdings Plc and freeing up headroom for Schiphol. Further expansion of Europe’s third-largest hub would help support KLM’s efforts to vie with carriers like Deutsche Lufthansa AG and IAG SA’s British Airways, according to Lelystad supporters. The Netherlands has shown that it’s prepared to go to significant lengths to protect its aviation interests. Earlier this year, the Dutch government secretly accumulated a 14% stake in parent company Air France-KLM, sparking a spat with France over influence at the group. “One thing is very clear and without dispute: the importance of Schiphol as a hub,” said Mustafa Amhaouch, a lawmaker for the coalition Christian Democratic Appeal party, adding that Lelystad is “key” for the development of KLM’s home base. Limiting aviation isn’t a realistic option, and environmental concerns could be addressed by technology advances and the European Union’s Green Deal policies, he said. Opponents aren’t buying it, arguing that low-wage airport jobs and incremental development don’t justify the environmental cost. “It is unthinkable and unacceptable to open a new airport in this day and age,” said Leon Adegeest, head of a group that is seeking to block the opening. “The government would be smart in saying we are going to look into what is really best for society.” For Rutte’s party, that answer is already clear. Infrastructure Minister Cora van Nieuwenhuizen wants to push for the first Lelystad flights next year, despite the brewing controversy. “My optimism is indestructible,” she said. ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.

" Mounting concern about carbon emissions may be altering travel habits in Europe’s largest economy as figures from German airports show a steady decline in passengers taking domestic flights. The number of people flying between German cities fell 12% in November from a year earlier, according to the ADV industry group, marking a fourth straight monthly drop and mirroring a pattern emerging in Sweden, where teenage activist Greta Thunberg has spearheaded a campaign against air transport. Rail firm Deutsche Bahn AG has meanwhile reported record passenger numbers. The data adds to signs that climate change is fostering a sense of so-called flying shame - flygskam in Swedish - among travelers that’s causing some to avoid one of the most polluting forms of travel. The phenomenon may be more advanced in Germany after the country suffered a series of extreme weather events that saw it buffeted by thunderstorms and the River Rhine running dry. “To me, this is evidence of heightened awareness of climate change turning to consumer action,” said Stefan Goessling, professor of transport economics at Linnaeus University business school, Sweden, who analyzed the data and found a slowing economy, strikes and airline failures didn’t fully explain the slump. The ADV numbers show that flights from Germany to other European countries have also declined to a lesser degree, something that might be accounted for by the relative uncompetitiveness of rail on trips much beyond four hours. The number of inter-continental trips, where surface transport isn’t practical and which are often less discretionary than shorter ones, involving family visits and key business events, is still increasing. The German trends replicate those seen in Sweden, where airport operator Swedavia AB reported in April that passenger numbers had dropped for seven consecutive months, just as state rail operator SJ posted record figures. In Germany, which has suffered record-breaking heatwaves and a drop in Rhine water levels that halted barge shipments, caused fuel shortages and disrupted power production, the environment has become the most pressing issue among voters, according to pollster Matthias Jung. Support for the country’s Greens is above 20%, trailing only Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats. ADV has suggested other factors may be at play in the slump, including strikes at Deutsche Lufthansa AG and the cancellation of routes between Berlin and three other cities. Goessling said that explanation doesn’t stack up given that the passenger numbers have declined across the country. Neither is the economy likely to have been a major factor, with household spending up 1.8% in the third quarter and consumer confidence rated “exceptionally high.” Deutsche Bahn reckons annual passenger numbers on long-distance trains will reach 260 million by 2040, almost double the total for 2015. The German government is helping to spur the shift, slashing ticket prices about 10% through tax cuts in a move forecast to win over about five million inter-city passengers a year. UBS last month said Europe may set for a “high-speed rail renaissance” as deregulation aids better services and cheaper fares. The European Union plans to impose a jet-fuel levy as part of its new environmental strategy. Carriers including Ryanair Holdings Plc oppose the move and say nations could more effectively lower carbon emissions by investing in sustainable fuels and electric planes and simplifying air traffic control networks. Alexandre de Juniac, head of the International Air Transport Association, last month urged carriers to better communicate what they’re doing to reduce emissions, warning: “We expect anti-flying sentiment to grow and spread.” ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.

" Thirty-three Indian wetlands, including five each in Delhi and Rajasthan, face moderate to very high threat to their ecology, according to a report by the environment ministry. The report has been shared with states where these sites are located, said an official aware of the development. The ministry said these wetlands require immediate attention and interventions, and has called wetland managers of these states to Delhi on December 20 for a one-day workshop to prepare integrated management plans. According to the letter by Ravi Agrawal, additional secretary of ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) to environment department principal secretaries, the ministry has proposed to provide funds under the centrally-sponsored scheme of National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Ecosystems (NPCA) to states for corrective action. HT has a copy of this letter. “Of the identified wetlands taken up for study, there are about 30 which fall under the moderate to low ecosystem health and have moderate to very high threat. These wetlands require immediate attention and interventions,” the letter said. The 33 critical wetlands are situated in 19 states, most in Delhi and Rajasthan. According to the ecosystem health ranks and threat categories of wetlands, three Delhi wetlands – Bhalswa Lake, Smritivan Lake (Kondli Lake) and Smritivan Lake (Vasant Kunj Lake) – are in the high threat category and the remaining two – Sanjay and Hauz Khas – in the moderate threat category. According to a Delhi government official, who was not willing to be named, said the city government set up a wetland development authority earlier this year for the preservation and restoration of wetlands and water. “Till last year, the responsibility of preservation and revival of wetlands was with multiple agencies such as Delhi Development Authority, Delhi Jal Board and Public Works Department. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) in November 2018 ordered the government to expedite the process of setting up a central agency for better efficiency,” the officer said. In Rajasthan, Sambhar Lake has very high threat, and four others – Mansagar, Pichola, Fateh Sagar and Udai Sagar – face moderate threat. Rajasthan environment principal secretary Sreya Guha said four of the lakes mentioned in the list are under the local self government (LSG) department. “We will tell the LSG to nominate people for the workshop. For Sambhar, we will send DCF Jaipur,” she said, adding that the state government has already notified a authority for Sambhar lake. The ministry has shared the wetland ecosystem health assessment report with the states. The report said the data on threats was organised into the following categories: physical regime change (adverse change in water quality and quantity, sediments and salinity); extraction (water, biota, soil and minerals); introduction (pollutants, invasive species); and structural modification of habitat (drainage, conversion into non-wetland use or encroachment). The official quoted above said the entire process was steered by the wetlands division of the MoEFCC and implemented by the state governments in collaboration with knowledge partners such as Wetlands International South Asia (WISA), World Wide Fund for Nature-India, Chilika Development Authority, Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (SACON), Environment Planning and Coordination Organisation (EPCO) and Geer Ecological Education and Research (GEER) Foundation. Wetlands have been given threat scores between .91 or above (for very high threat) and .30 or below (for very low). The data on threat scores indicate that 11 wetlands are in very high threat category (A+ and A-), 17 in high threat category (B+ and B-), 25 in moderate threat category (C+ and C-) and 58 wetlands in Low threat category (D and E). The official said water quantity and frequency, pollutants, drainage and encroachment were the major threats on which these sites scored high. “Wetlands located on the coast, semi-arid and North-east had a relatively higher proportion within very high and high threat category,” he added. The ministry letter sent to states said a full-day workshop for preparation of integrated management plans would be held on December 20 in MoEFCC. The states have been asked to send wetland managers and representatives of state wetland authority for the workshop."
" In May of 2017, nearly 300 experts in global health, medicine, biology, policy and climate research signed a letter addressed to the World Health Organization, calling on it to take a more serious look at the impact of industrial livestock production, also known as ‘factory farming’, on human health and the climate. Factory farming is known to exacerbate climate change by releasing vast volumes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide and methane. Every year, more than 9 billion animals in the US are raised and killed on factory farms, contributing to a range of problems, from increasing antibiotic resistance to the climate crisis. “As the global health community acknowledges the intertwined nature of planetary and human health, it must also confront the role that factory farming plays in climate change” the letter says, highlighting the interconnectedness of health, climate and meat consumption. The data tells us that approximately 700,000 people die each year of diseases resistant to antibiotics. These are, of course, used widely in factory farms to keep animals alive in abominable conditions, while pushing for maximum productivity. Close to twenty percent of greenhouse gas emissions are generated from industrial scale meat farms, a bigger source of pollution than the transportation sector. Growing crops to feed and graze livestock also leads to extensive deforestation. As developing economies grow and become wealthier, one of the first things to change is dietary choice. Which usually translates into more meat. While it isn’t surprising that the emerging middle classes would want the same luxuries that people in wealthy countries enjoy, the exponential rise in the demand for animal protein poses a lot of challenges. In an attempt to address this looming crisis, companies like Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat have jumped into the fray with their “meatless meat” products. The products marketed as alternative meat today differ in one significant way from traditional meat alternatives like veggie burgers. ‘Beyond Meat burgers’ and ‘Impossible Burgers’, while made from plants, are designed to taste like meat, are meant for non-vegetarians – and some day hope to take the place of traditional meat products on supermarket shelves. Impossible Burgers are made using heme from soy plants, or soy leghemoglobin, which is identical to heme from animals and gives these burgers their distinctly meaty flavour. Plant-based meat is also much lower in fat and cholesterol and doesn’t contain antibiotics or animal hormones, which are often found in read meat. A big part of the attraction for alternative meat products comes from public awareness about climate change. An analysis of the Impossible Burger found that its carbon footprint is 89 percent smaller than a burger made from a cow. It also uses 87 percent less water and 96 percent less land. Increasingly, both entrepreneurs and consumers are driven to “do the right thing” for the environment. That it is also a highly lucrative and fast growing industry is an added bonus. Impossible struck a deal with fast food giant Burger King to offer meatless Whoppers (now available at 10,000 outlets) while Carl’s Jr. and Del Taco announced they would offer Beyond Meat products. Both companies have also raised large sums from first round IPO funding and private equity. There is another entrant in the alternative meat sector – lab grown or cell-based meat. While plant-based meat products try to simulate the experience of eating meat, cell-based meat uses actual animal cells, grown in a serum instead of as animal parts. These products don’t just taste like meat, they are actually meat on a molecular level. Lab grown meat, however is still a long way away from the dinner table, unlike plant-based meats, which are already available to consumers. In addition to environmental benefits, meat alternatives could help put an end to the horrifyingly inhumane treatment of animals raised for food. We know beyond a reasonable doubt that farm animals are conscious beings, with complex social structures and intricate psychological patterns. Suffering and happiness are not uniquely human qualities. Like us, animals too feel pain, fear and loneliness. Yet, we seldom give a second thought to the senseless torture of these sentient beings, happening right before our eyes on an unimaginable scale. Yes — meatless meat may be growing fast and making the headlines, but at this point it’s too small to matter, making up less than 1 percent of the product volume of traditional meat. Right now, nearly all meat sold in the US and worldwide come from giant animal torture factories. Be that as it may, what the global buzz around meatless meat indicates is that big business may finally be waking up to the reality of climate change and the abomination of factory farming. Technology and the obsession with endless growth may have brought us to this precipice but only time will tell if market-friendly innovations created by scientist-entrepreneurs with a social conscience can gain enough traction with consumers to help save the day."
" * The classic, re-discovered When JG Ballard wrote it in 1962, The Drowned World was an out-and-out science fiction novel. Ballard imagined a future in which polar ice had melted and sea levels had risen – something even scientists hadn’t worked out yet. Ballard’s novel was dismissed as a genre staple, but is now being hailed as one of the grandfathers of climate fiction. * Shining examples In Flight Behaviour by Barbara Kingsolver, a swarm of monarch butterflies appears, numbering in the millions, for no apparent reason, in a rural Tennessee town. Locals see it as a miracle. Businessmen want to make money off it. TV reporters sensationalise it. A scientist blames climate change. But for one woman, perhaps they just mean freedom? The Water Knife, by Paolo Bacigalupi, is more of a thriller. Heat and water shortages cause drought in the American southwest, corporates control water supply. And spies, or ‘water knives’, sabotage and cut flow. Then a new source is discovered. One spy teams up with two shrewd women to investigate and stay alive. What happens when the world’s foremost disaster forecaster predicts that Manhattan will drown, and proves to be right? He becomes a media sensation. Nathaniel Rich’s novel, Odds Against Tomorrow, despite its exhaustive research, is light on its feet. In Kim Stanley Robinson’s New York 2140, the title marks where and when. In a submerged Manhattan, every street is a canal, every skyscraper an island. The book marks the connection between capitalism and rising sea levels. Eight chapters take you through how life changes, and yet, optimistically, remains the same. * The ones with a sense of humour A climate catastrophe has changed everything. Borders are sealed. Beaches have disappeared. Britain’s coast is guarded by The Wall, manned by conscripted civilians keeping an eye out for migrants. It’s cold, dull work. But John Lanchester’s novel, sharp and funny, is anything but grim. Ashley Shelby’s South Pole Station sees an artist dispatched to Antarctica to live with researchers, and paint. The social dynamics are already off, when a climate denier joins to do his research, which he hopes will prove all the rest of them wrong. Worse still, the artist ends up helping him. In Solar, Ian McEwan’s satirical take on climate fears, a jaded, womanising Nobel Prize-winning physicist — a sceptic who has more confidence than good sense or social skills — tries to save the world and find fame. His idea of stealing a better solar energy model ends up implicating him in a murder case, and that’s not even the worst of it. * The short stories Warmer is a collection of seven stories set in a believable future of a planet heating up through climate change. In one story, The Way the World Ends, by Jess Walter, a hydrogeologist wonders if it still makes sense to freeze one’s eggs when “one hundred percent of legitimate climate scientists believe the world to be on the verge of irreversible collapse”. On a more positive note, Glass and Gardens: Solarpunk Summers, edited by Sarena Ulibarri, collects 17 stories that imagine more collaborative futures in which we fight and survive changing climate. Olivia Clare’s Disasters in the First World looks at how global environmental change affects individuals and their inner worlds. In a story set in a future Las Vegas, drugs are cheaper than drinking water. * The work from India Tanushree and Ajoy Podder’s Decoding the Feronia Files is a thriller that imagines what might happen if governments weaponised weather. There are artificial storms, earthquakes and temperature changes based on actual climate-manipulation research. Poet Urvashi Bahuguna’s collection, Terrarium, doesn’t seem like ‘cli’ or ‘fi’ at first. But her poems about mangoes, the Indian monsoon, growing up and examining one’s mind are inseparable from the changing physical world she inhabits."
" * In the Chicago Review of Books, Amy Brady publishes a column called Burning Worlds. It keeps track of notable climate fiction and features authors working in the genre. * Dan Bloom, who coined the term cli-fi in the mid-2000s when he was a journalist, runs The Cli-Fi Report, a site devoted to the genre. It covers new ideas in climate fiction, how science is influencing the arts, and lists studies examining the consequences of climate change. * America Adapts – The Climate Change Podcast looks at how the earth is changing and how our reactions to that change keep evolving. They’ve featured climate fiction and creative work on several episodes. * Mary Woodbury publishes Cli-Fi Books, a webzine that lists cli-fi novels past and present. * Artists and Climate Change tracks climate-change-related art presented in opera houses, hip-hop poetry slams, art galleries and on-the-fly exhibitions, as well as regional theatres, in countries around the world."
         
" 86 fashion companies have asked political leaders around the world to partner with them to deliver effective and ambitious climate action, as part of an event celebrating one year of the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action. The call was made at the ongoing 25th Conference of Parties (COP25) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in this Spanish capital. The summit, with delegates from 200 countries, including India, is expected to finalise rules governing the 2015 Paris Agreement that formally kicks the next year. The communique from the fashion companies calls for a partnership with political leaders of countries with major fashion production and consumer markets, to create enabling policy environments that will bring the industry in line with the goal of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. “The climate crisis is one of the most important issues to tackle. As a global fashion retailer, we have a big role to play and collaboration is key,” CEO H&M Group Karl-Johan Persson said. “All actors need to take responsibility to drive the change towards cutting emissions and staying within planetary boundaries. Companies need to commit to this change and governments need to facilitate the process with the right laws, regulations and implementation thereof.” The communique also identifies some concrete solutions related to renewable energy and calls for clear planning context for investment plans, availability of scaled-up grid-connected renewable energy sources, phasing-out of high-emitting fossil fuel-based sources of energy and incentives for the transition to renewables. It is supported by all fashion charter companies and championed by CEOs of Aldo Group, Burberry, Esprit Group, H&M Group, Nike Inc., Puma SE, PVH Corp. and nine CEOs from brands, suppliers and retailers. “The consequences of climate change are real for all of us. Nike is on our own journey toward a zero-carbon and zero waste future, but we know to accelerate the progress we need collective action across our industry,” said Mark Parker, Chairman, President and CEO, NIKE Inc. At the event held at the UN Climate Change annual conference, some of the biggest brands in fashion took to the stage to reaffirm their commitment to achieving at least 30 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions across the whole value chain by 2030 and to scale renewable energy and climate programmes in key textile production countries. Charter members recognize that current solutions and business models are not sufficient to deliver on the urgent need for climate action and have initiated an action-oriented roadmap to create mechanisms that will scale technical transformation within value chains, identify financial tools to fund that transformation and enhance collaboration with policymakers. The Fashion Industry Charter brings together not only fashion brands, but manufacturers and retailers, logistics and investment companies and NGOs, and seeks to expand concrete engagement with all actors across the supply chain to transform to a sustainable industry.

" The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP25) at Madrid ended without closure on the most important issues—new carbon markets, enhanced ambition by developed countries to meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping global mean temperature rise under 2 degrees, and compensating vulnerable countries for loss and damage. While the draft texts released on Friday afternoon (Madrid time) on some these issues showed marginal progress, the overall understanding was that the COP failed to recognise the urgency of the climate crisis underlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). “Some issues have progressed more than others. I request co-facilitators to work overnight. Please work on the text for review of the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage and Article 6 (pertaining to carbon markets). We only have a few hours left to get to an agreement. We will take stock on landing zones,” said Carolina Schmidt, COP25 President during the final stock-taking on the progress at COP. New texts will be published on Saturday. India’s chief negotiator Ravi Shankar Prasad flagged important unresolved concerns for India including upholding the principle of equity and common but differentiated responsibility (based on different capabilities of economies) and asked that parties actions should be commensurate with their national circumstances. “It is implementation of commitments, fulfilling of past targets which will lead to higher ambition. Nationally determined contributions (NDCs) are country driven and therefore there is no mandate on a top down direction. Equity and Common But Differing Responsibilities are the bedrock of the Paris Agreement which should be respected,” he said, referring to lack of implementation of pre-2020 commitments by developed countries and indicating that India may not enhance its NDC in 2020 as this is already 2 degrees compatible as per Climate Action Tracker’s assessment. The draft text on carbon markets was weak as of Friday and heavily bracketed because the issue of carry-over of carbon credits from the clean development mechanism under Kyoto Protocol and the environmental integrity of the new markets to achieve a real reduction in greenhouse gas emissions remained unresolved. “Article 6, the spotlight of COP25, is the only part of the Paris Agreement that directly interacts with the private sector. Despite the last-minute effort towards bridging the gap, the gavel did not fall on the key decision on carry over,” said Chirag Gajjar, lead mitigation, climate at World Resources Institute (WRI). The draft text on how vulnerable nations will be compensated for irreversible impacts of climate change such as sea level rise, biodiversity loss or extreme weather events remained very weak on finance. “The language is weak, its not binding. It talks about generating financial support from existing resources and uses words like ‘urges’ and ‘scale up’ instead of ‘decide’ or ‘recognise.’ The text has not delivered what was expected of it. The US is holding even this text hostage as it does not want any liability,” said Harjeet Singh, global lead on climate change for ActionAid. The master draft text which summarises all the decisions taken at the COP also lacks ambition and fails to give its due to warnings from climate scientists according to leaders from vulnerable countries and the Climate Ambition Alliance (group of countries willing to enhance NDCs to meet the Paris goal). “The big message is that we will leave Madrid with a very clear call to raise ambition in line with the IPCC special report on 1.5 degree global warming. We are concerned that framing of ambition in the current text is weak. We stress science is not negotiable and should guide our work. We want the highest standard of environmental integrity in carbon markets,” said delegate representing Marshall Islands and the Alliance. The message from the Alliance was that US, Australia and Brazil were stalling progress on key issues. Some felt the COP added to the problem of global warming by way of carbon emissions with over 26,000 delegates, civil society members and media gathered over two weeks for one of the biggest annual climate jamborees (as many call it), which was expected to get the big polluters on board to raise their ambition to meet the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global mean temperature rise under 2 degrees."
" Failure to tackle global warming could result in economic disaster, the United Nations Secretary-General warned Thursday in Madrid, as negotiators at the U.N. climate talks remained deadlocked over key issues. António Guterres said unrestrained climate change would allow only the “survival of the richest,” while former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the “absence of leadership” from Washington was a big obstacle in the talks. “It’s very difficult to get this done if the United States of America isn’t there,” the veteran diplomat told The Associated Press during an interview in the Spanish capital, adding that he felt negotiators were holding their breath until the next U.S. presidential election at the end of 2020. President Donald Trump’s administration has begun the process of abandoning an ambitious 2015 global deal forged by his predecessor Barack Obama that aimed to contain rising temperatures on the planet. Officially the U.S. leaves the Paris accord on Nov. 4, 2020, the day after the U.S. election. “I think Glasgow is already more of a target in many people’s minds here, and that handicaps the process slightly,” Kerry said, referring to the venue of next year’s U.N. climate summit. In Madrid, “there will be accomplishments, there’ll be some forward progress, but really, everyone knows that the crunch is going to come next year with the raising ambition issue,” he added. Scientists say countries need to stop burning fossil fuels by 2050 at the latest to ensure global temperatures don’t rise more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) this century. Not giving up on that goal, U.N. chief Guterres urged officials from almost 200 countries to embrace the economic opportunities that come with cutting greenhouse gases rather than focus on the risks to existing industries dependent on fossil fuels. “For too long, vested interests have peddled the false story that economic growth and tackling climate change are incompatible,” the U.N. chief said. “This is nonsense.” “In fact, failing to tackle global heating is a sure-fire recipe for economic disaster,” Guterres added. He cited a study showing that shifting to a low-carbon economy could create 65 million new jobs worldwide by 2030 and boost growth by $26 trillion dollars. “This transition needs to be done to benefit everybody,” Guterres said. “And not doing this transition will only allow, as I said, the survival of the richest.” At the talks, vulnerable countries expressed outrage over Australia’s bid to hold onto piles of emissions vouchers left over from a now-discredited system that could allow it to meet its climate commitments without reducing pollution. Asked about Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s recent assertion that his country was part of the “Pacific family,” the economy minister of Fiji responded that “when you have family members you also have some black sheep members too in the family.” “At the moment, it would seem that they appear to be far from eating at the same table,” Aiyaz Sayed Khaiyum told reporters in Madrid, adding that he hoped Australia would “let go of their current position.” Small, low-lying islands like Fiji are particularly vulnerable to tropical storms and sea-level rise worsened by climate change. Simon Stiell, environment minister of the Caribbean island of Grenada, warned that some countries at the U.N. meeting “are losing sight of the bigger picture as if there is no climate emergency.” “This inaction is costing the lives of our people and impacting the lives and the livelihoods of millions around the world,” Stiell said. “We need to stop talking. We know what must be done.” Talks to agree rules for global carbon markets and aid for poor countries already affected by climate change have made little progress in recent days. Bas Eickhout, an influential Green Party lawmaker in the European Parliament, said maintaining the “integrity” of the 2015 Paris climate accord was a priority for the 28-nation bloc. Some negotiators have expressed concern that loopholes in a deal about international carbon markets could allow some countries to claim emissions reductions on paper that haven’t actually been made. “In that sense, from a European perspective, we are absolutely clear that: better no deal than a bad deal,” said Eickhout. The summit’s president, Chile’s Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt, urged delegates to find “no excuses for not reaching agreements” and added that the world’s “youth and women” were demanding action, “one that is equal to the historical challenge that we are facing.” “I call on you to work together to be able to give a positive response tomorrow,” she said. Separately, two former top U.S. officials signaled that in the absence of leadership from the U.S., Beijing had an opportunity to champion global leadership in fighting climate change if the world’s second largest economy reconsiders its current promotion of coal. “It would be down to China’s everlasting credit if this policy of financing the construction of so many new coal plants in other countries could respectfully be reviewed and reconsidered,” Al Gore, the former U.S. vice president, told China’s top climate official in Madrid, Vice Minister of Ecology and Environment Zhao Yinming. Kerry, who as the U.S. top diplomat paved the way for the Paris accord by brokering a U.S.-China climate agreement in 2014, told the AP that Beijing’s reliance on coal “will undo a lot of the good that’s been done,” but added that Chinese involvement in fighting climate change “is critical.” He also said the Trump administration’s trade war with China is dragging possible solutions to the fight against climate change."
" A Sikh-American organisation in Washington on Thursday pledged to support the plantation of 100 forests in Punjab and other parts of India as part of their efforts to combat climate change. Members of EcoSikh, during its 7th Gala in Washington, pledged to combat climate change by planting Guru Nanak Sacred forests in Punjab and elsewhere in the world, a statement issued by the organisation said. “The planting of 100 Guru Nanak Sacred forests will also help EcoSikh reach its target of planting one million trees in honour of Guru Nanak’s 550th birth-anniversary,” it said. EcoSikh has planted 120 mini forests of 550 trees of native species in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujrat, Delhi, Jammu and Chandigarh, according to the statement. “This will restore nature’s imbalance in Punjab and other parts of India. The world is facing a pollution crisis and it is affecting the health of our children. Planting a forest is the best investment for our collective future,” said Shubhendu Sharma from Afforestt, a service provider for creating natural, wild, maintenance free, native forests."
" Eight-year-old Licypriya Kangujam, known as Indian ‘Greta’ for her passion towards the fight against climate change has urged global leaders to take immediate action to save the planet and the future of young children like her. Speaking at the COP25 climate conference here, the young activist from Manipur who has already spoken in 21 countries on climate change, gave the world a glimpse of her resolve as she urged global leaders to “act now against climate change”. The little girl has quickly shot to limelight with Spanish newspapers hailing her as ‘Greta’ of the Global South. Watching Kangujam speak with such wisdom, it’s hard to guess her age -- all of eight years old. But she nearly missed the chance to give her message to the world. According to her father, KK Singh, who accompanied her to Spain, several requests to the government to help her with funding fell on deaf ears. Singh noted that when the UN sent her the invitation letter to participate, and address her concerns at COP25, they had no idea how they will manage the expenses to travel to Spain. Singh said the family sent email requests to several ministers for sponsorship but got no reply. He said after trying to crowdfund her trip, a person from Bhubaneshwar booked their tickets to Madrid. “My mom broke her gold chain and finally booked my hotels,” Kangujam said. However, Singh added that just a day before leaving for Madrid from India on November 30, they got an email from the Spanish government that they would sponsor their accommodation for the 13-day event. Making it to Madrid after crossing so many hurdles made Kangujam even more determined to ensure she is heard. “I have come here to tell the world leaders that this is the time to act as it is a real climate emergency,” the young activist enthralled the audiences on Tuesday during a high level event at ‘The UN Climate Change Conference COP 25 being held in the Spanish capital from December 2-13. Kangujam had to drop out of school in February as she could not attend most of her classes. Activism, including participating in a weekly protest outside the Parliament house, took up most of her time. While her fight against climate change will continue, the girl has not given up on the dream of pursuing her education altogether. According to Singh, Kangujam is the youngest climate activist in the world. The 28-year-old father said that in 2018, when Kangujam was just six-year-old, she got an opportunity to attend the 3rd Asia Ministerial Conference for Disaster Risks reduction 2018 (AMCDRR 2018) in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. “It was my life changing event. During the conference, I met many world leaders and also thousands of delegates from various countries of the world. Many had highlighted various issues of disaster,” Kangujam told PTI on the sidelines of the event. “I cry when I see children losing their parents and people becoming homeless due to danger of disasters. My heart feels sorrowful for people who can’t help themselves when disaster strikes. Many root causes are the impact of climate change,” she said. Just after her return from Mongolia, Kanjugam with the help of her father started an organisation called ‘The Child Movement’ to call on the world leaders to take immediate climate action to save the planet and the future of young children like her. So far, Singh said, Kangujam has travelled 21 countries and spoken at many events as a part of her movement. “I travel place to place to raise my concerns about climate change and disaster risks reduction to the people of the world,” the young climate activist explained. The Spanish newspaper El Pais described Kangujam one of the ‘Greta’ of the global south, after her walk with the Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg last week here. Kangujam was seen holding a poster demanding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi pass a law to deal with climate change. At the high level meeting, Kangujam, speaking alongside several other political leaders from around the globe, made an emotional appeal to the world leaders to act before it is too late. “I’m coming here to tell the world leaders that this is the time for action. What I want is not about today or tomorrow but what needs to be done now,” she explained. She noted in her speech that when she was born, the world leaders had already met 16 times in the COP, and they already knew about the bad effects of climate change. “Our policy makers from around the world just gather here every year at COPs and do nothing concrete for our future,” she said. “Why should I come here? Why I should speak here? I have to go to my school. I have to read my books. I have to play. I have to study. But our leaders all have ruined my childhood life and my beautiful future. This is not fair!”she said. Kangujam was born in Imphal but has almost always lived outside the state, especially in Delhi and in Bhubaneswar. She noted that the young climate activists like her want “a system change, not the climate change.” She said the governments must come in action on what they promised, referring to the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement of limiting global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2030."
" Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg was named Time’s “person of the year” Wednesday, becoming at age 16 the youngest person to whom the U.S. magazine has given the title. Thunberg emerged as the face of the youth climate movement after she started skipping school once a week to protest outside her country’s parliament. In the past year and a half, she has drawn large crowds at international conferences and demonstrations outside Sweden. Some have welcomed Thunberg’s environmental activism, including her speeches challenging world leaders to do more to stop global warming. But others have criticized the teenager’s sometimes combative tone. “For sounding the alarm about humanity’s predatory relationship with the only home we have, for bringing to a fragmented world a voice that transcends backgrounds and borders, for showing us all what it might look like when a new generation leads, Greta Thunberg is TIME’s 2019 Person of the Year,” the media franchise said Wednesday on its website.   This was the year the climate crisis went from behind the curtain to center stage, from ambient political noise to squarely on the world's agenda, and no one did more to make that happen than @gretathunberg. Meaningful change rarely happens without the galvanizing force of influential individuals, writes editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal, and in 2019, the earth's existential crisis found one in Thunberg. For that reason, she is TIME's 2019 Person of the Year. Read more about the #TIMEPOY choice at the link in bio. Photograph by @evgenia_arbugaeva for TIME; Video by @maxim_arbugaev for TIME A post shared by TIME (@time) on Dec 11, 2019 at 4:45am PST Leaving a United Nations climate conference in Madrid where she addressed negotiators on Wednesday, Thunberg told The Associated Press she was “a bit surprised” by Time’s recognition, which she dedicated to all young activists. “I could never have imagined anything like that happening,” she said in a phone interview. “I’m of course, very grateful for that, very honored,” Thunberg said, but added: “It should be everyone in the Fridays for Future movement because what we have done, we have done together.” Thunberg said she was hopeful the message of urgency she and other activists are communicating — that governments need to drastically increase their efforts to combat climate change — is finally getting through. The teenager has also been a strong advocate of science, regularly citing complex studies about the causes and impacts of climate change. On Wednesday, Thunberg used her address at the U.N.’s annual climate summit to accuse governments and businesses of misleading the public by holding talks that she said aren’t going to stop the world’s “climate emergency.” “The real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening, when in fact almost nothing is being done, apart from clever accounting and creative PR,” she said. Thunberg cited scientific reports showing that national pledges to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions aren’t enough to meet the ambitious goal set in the 2015 Paris climate accord of keeping temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsis (2.7 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century.   Greta Thunberg speaks quietly but forcefully, articulating the palpable sense of injustice that often seems obvious to the very young: adults, by refusing to act in the face of extraordinary crisis, are being foolish at best, and corrupt at worst. To those who share her fear, @gretathunberg's blunt honesty is cathartic. To those who don’t, it feels threatening. She refuses to use the language of hope; her sharpest weapon is shame. In September, speaking to heads of state ahead of the @unitednations General Assembly, Thunberg pulled no punches: ""We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth,"" she said. ""How dare you."" In this photograph, Thunberg writes in her journal on the train as she travels from Lisbon to Madrid for the current U.N. climate conference.

Fourteen months later, she had become the voice of millions, a symbol of a rising global rebellion. The politics of climate action are as entrenched and complex as the phenomenon itself, and @gretathunberg has no magic solution. But she has succeeded in creating a global attitudinal shift, transforming millions of vague, middle-of-the-night anxieties into a worldwide movement calling for urgent change. @gretathunberg is TIME’s 2019 Person of the Year.

She said the experience of the past 15 months, going from solo-protester outside the Swedish parliament to addressing world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, had changed her. “I think life is much more meaningful now that I have something to do that has an impact,” Thunberg said in a phone interview. She plans to head home to Sweden for some rest during the holidays. “If you don’t take breaks, you won’t be able to continue,” she said.

" The world is getting hotter and more dangerous faster than previously thought, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said here at the COP 25 climate conference on Wednesday, urging the countries that carbon pollution must stop rising in 2020 to keep the Paris Agreement goals within realistic reach. The Paris agreement was adopted by 195 parties at the UN climate conference “COP 21” held in the French capital in 2015 with an aim to reduce the hazardous greenhouse gas emissions. Nineteen members of the G20, except the US, have voiced their commitment to the full implementation of the deal. “The world is getting hotter and more dangerous faster than we ever thought possible. Irreversible tipping points are within sight and hurtling towards us,” he said while addressing a high-level meeting at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP25 in the Spanish capital. “It is a testament to the urgency of the job before us all. The scientific evidence presented in recent weeks has only heightened this urgency,” he said. On December 2, Guterres opened the COP 25 climate summit here, warning that the governments risked sleepwalking “past a point of no return” if they remained idle. The annual negotiations to bolster the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb global warming began in the backdrop of unusually severe climate related disasters this year, from fires in the Arctic, Amazon and Australia to intense tropical hurricanes. In his latest address, Guterres urged the countries that carbon pollution must stop rising in 2020 and start falling to keep the Paris Agreement goals within realistic reach. “We are a very long way behind, but there is still reason to believe we can win this race,” he said. However, he noted that the world has the force of science, new models of cooperation, and a rising tide of momentum for change. “Crucially, we have a global framework in the Paris Agreement to get the job done. We now need to put it fully to work,” he said. He also emphasised that the countries must honour the pledges made in Paris in 2015 to scale up their national climate pledges every five years, starting in 2020. Noting that the next 12 months will be crucial for climate action, he said that in 2020, the world must deliver what the scientific community has defined as a must, else it will pay an “unbearable price.” “That means embarking on the path to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030 and to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050,” the UN chief said. He noted that this is what the UN expects from the review of national commitments under the Paris Agreement at COP26 next year in Glasgow, UK. “And I hope as many countries as possible will step up this year at COP25,” he said. Guterres also said that lifting ambition over the next 12 months has been the touchstone of this year’s COP. “And it was a centrepiece of the Climate Action Summit I convened in September,” he said."
" India and Germany, which are working closely on multilateral issues, are both ideal candidates for permanent membership of a reformed UN Security Council (UNSC) that reflects the realities of today’s world, German ambassador Walter Lindner has said. Following German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s visit to India last month, the two countries are now focusing on implementing more than 20 existing MoUs and cooperation in key areas such as smart cities, green mobility and climate change, Lindner said in an interview. The envoy reiterated Merkel’s position that the security lockdown and communications blackout in Kashmir is “not sustainable”, saying Germany, like other members of the European Union (U), wants all restrictions to be lifted “as soon as possible”. Lindner said all countries stand to lose if the UN isn’t reformed as people won’t rely on the world body “because they will say it is not reflecting the reality”. The G4 – Brazil, Japan, India and Germany – have been mutually supporting each other for permanent membership of a reformed Security Council, he said. “India is not there (in the Security Council) with 1.4 billion people. This is just not acceptable,” he said. “It (Security Council) has to reflect today’s reality. Of course, India has to be there.” Lindner said the UN may have its faults and shortcomings, but “it’s the only one we have…If we don’t agree with many things, we have to reform it. I’m totally in favour of reforming the UN system to make it more credible and acceptable.” Merkel’s visit has given a “good extra push” to bilateral relations and the two sides “are on the same wavelength on many things (such as) multilateralism”, he noted. Pointing to Merkel’s concerns about Delhi’s poor air quality during her visit – the AQI had touched 1,000 – the envoy said the two countries are working on several schemes for smart cities and green mobility that are aimed at tackling climate change. This includes German funding for solar panels at a metro station near the Delhi airport and “last mile connectivity” from metro stations in various cities."
" Climate change is the greatest threat faced by the world in history, according to a 26-country survey released by the Pew Research Center. The United Nations has called climate change as the “defining issue of our time” and we at its defining moment. Awareness and support for climate action has risen rapidly in the recent years, especially amongst the youth. As a passionate environmentalist, it is heartening to see so many fellow young people care about the planet. It is a source of pride to know that there are so many like-minded individuals standing up for the planet and for our own future. Fighting climate change is a mammoth task and we need all hands-on deck if we are to have a real shot. This has been a momentous year for climate activism with millions of people protesting for climate action all over the world. On September 20, over four million protesters gathered in more than 150 countries making it the largest climate strikes in world history. Crowds full of children, youth and even older people have come out and participated in these strikes happening throughout the year. I was among the thousands of people who joined the protests in London this year. However, the question that continues to trouble me since I participated in the strikes was, what are we striking for? Climate action by the governments, yes, but what climate action? While the present climate activism movement has certainly helped the cause in terms of raising awareness, it spells out little in terms of meaningful action. And this is where the issue with present climate activism lies. Millions of people striking for a cause without defining what outcomes they expect. This is partially the reason why it is easy for anyone to applaud and be a supporter of the movement. After all, the movement is asking for some undefined “climate action” which does not require anyone (even the governments that they are protesting to) to do anything tangible. Even asking the governments to declare a state of climate emergency seems a little meaningless, because there are no set actions a government needs to take to accompany that declaration. So, you can continue with business as usual, while publicly being in a state of climate emergency accompanied by a loosely defined “action plan”. Another issue with the movement in its present form is that it doesn’t hold companies or developed countries proportionately accountable. Is it only governments that need to take said “climate action”? What about the companies and developed nations who are historically responsible for greenhouse emissions? Why are developing nations expected by the youth of the world to share equal burden of a problem which has been primarily created by some developed nations? Does climate action not include the principles of common but differentiated responsibility and climate justice? Striking for climate action is a great first step in the right direction. However, in its present form, it will give the perpetrators of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions the to support the movement without making tangible changes towards sustainability. While striking for our future is a thought-provoking sentiment, without the necessary direction it will not be enough to bring about the changes we all envision. The climate movement in each city, state or country needs to define what steps they would like to see their governments and the private sector take in different areas such as transport, energy, waste management, urban development and ecosystem management, and protest specifically in demand of their fulfilment. Further, there should also be a way for citizens to pledge individual actions, however small, in support of the movement. This would highlight the commitment of the supporters and ensure that climate consciousness becomes a part of people’s everyday lives instead of being just a once a week ‘event’. This is the only way forward for the currently directionless climate movement.

" Countries from Egypt to Mexico could lose 95% of their income from coral reef tourism, and parts of West Africa could see their ocean fisheries decline by 85% by the turn of the century if planet-warming emissions continue to rise, oceans experts warned Friday. “Action in reducing emissions really needs to be taken, or we will be facing very important impacts” on oceans and people, said Elena Ojea, one of the authors of a new paper looking at the potential impacts of climate change on ocean economies. The study, released at the U.N. climate negotiations in Madrid, was commissioned by the leaders of 14 countries with ocean-dependent economies, and looked at ocean fisheries and seafood cultivation industries, and coral reef tourism. It found that reef tourism, a nearly $36-billion-a-year industry today, could see more than 90% losses globally by 2100 under a high-emissions scenario. Countries particularly dependent on coral reef tourism - Egypt, Indonesia, Mexico, Thailand and Australia - could see income cut by 95%, the paper noted. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, an ocean expert at Australia’s University of Queensland and one of paper’s authors, said his country’s Great Barrier Reef tourism industry - worth billions a year a year - was already seeing losses as corals bleached and died. Ojea, of Spain’s University of Vigo, said the 30 million people directly employed in ocean fishing each year also “will be heavily affected” as fish struggle with hotter and more acidic oceans and move to new ranges or die. She said the problem was most serious in equatorial regions, with some West African nations, in particular, facing “very huge losses” by the end of the century if emissions rise well beyond the 2 degree Celsius limit set in the 2015 Paris Agreement. But some cooler areas of the planet could see a rise in local fish stocks as fish move to cooler waters, she said. Efforts to adapt fisheries to changing conditions and better manage them, alongside stronger efforts to curb climate change, could cut expected losses, however, said Timothy Fitzgerald, director of the U.S.-based Environmental Defense Fund’s Fishery Solutions Center. “We know the most well-managed fisheries are also the most resilient to climate change,” he told journalists at an event on the sidelines of the U.N. talks. Vidar Helgesen, Norway’s special envoy to the 14-nation High-Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, said the paper should send a “very strong message to the world” on the need to act swiftly to prevent growing ocean-related losses. The report builds on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s findings that climate-related damage to oceans is likely to cost the global economy nearly $430 billion by 2050, and close to $2 trillion by 2100.

" Mumbai and its suburbs on Thursday recorded unseasonal rain in December under the influence of two active weather systems in the Arabian Sea as the weatherman said the cloud cover was expected to continue throughout the day. The suburbs and south Mumbai both recorded 1.2mm of rain between 5.30am and 9.30am on Thursday. The weather bureau said the weather was likely to clear up by the weekend. “A weather depression over the southwest Arabian Sea has led to active rainfall conditions for the west coast. Light drizzling has been witnessed in Mumbai and no further rainfall activity is expected during the day,” SG Kamble, a scientist with the India Meteorological Department (IMD), said. Private weather forecasting agency Skymet had predicted on and off rain for Thursday and the first half of Friday. “The deep depression is likely to remain till Friday and then weaken. Under its influence Mumbai will receive light on and off showers,” the agency’s vice president (meteorology and climate change) Mahesh Palawat said. Meanwhile, IMD on Thursday said that another deep depression in the east-central Arabian Sea had developed into Cyclone Pawan, the fifth cyclone in the Arabian Sea and eighth in the north Indian Ocean this year."
" India is the fifth most vulnerable country globally to climate crisis, according to a new analysis released on Wednesday. India recorded the highest deaths due to climate crisis-led disasters and the second highest amount of monetary losses in 2018, said the analysis. The Global Climate Risk Index 2020 by environmental think tank Germanwatch on the sidelines of the UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid, assessed 181 countries and quantified impacts of climate crisis on them through economic losses, losses to GDP and fatalities to arrive at a ranking. The index found Japan to be the most vulnerable followed by Philippines, Germany, Madagascar and India. While the poorer countries are understood to be most vulnerable, the index indicates that rich European nations are also extremely vulnerable to severe climate crisis impacts being felt in the past 20 years. The southwest monsoon in 2018 severely affected India, the analysis said adding that Kerala was especially affected where 324 people died because of drowning or being buried in the landslides set off by the flooding — the worst in a hundred years. “Over 220,000 people had to leave their homes, 20 000 houses and 80 dams were destroyed. The damage amounted to US$ 2.8 billion. India’s east coast was also hit by Cyclones Titli and Gaja in October and November 2018, with wind speeds of up to 150 km per hour. Cyclone Titli killed at least eight people and left around 450 000 without electricity,” the report said. Japan remains the most vulnerable, according to the analysis, because it was hit by extreme weather events in 2018. From July 6 to 8, heavy rainfall of more than 200 mm/day was recorded. Torrential rainfall resulted in flash floods and mudslides, killing more than 200 people and leading to over 5 000 houses being damaged and the evacuation of 2.3 million people. The event caused losses to the tune of US$ 7 billion. From the middle of July to the end of August 2018, severe heatwave led to 138 fatalities. And in September 2018, typhoon Jebi made landfall in Japan. Germany experienced the second hottest year in 2018 since records began. The period between April and July 2018 was the hottest ever recorded in Germany, with temperatures 2.9°C above average and led to the death of 1234 people. Germany received heavy rainfall in January but unusually low rainfall during the summer resulting in 70% of soil being affected by drought. Farmers called for federal emergency relief worth around EUR 1 billion after a massive decline in harvest caused a total loss of EUR 3 billion. The Climate Risk Index, which is based on data from the Munich Re NatCatSERVICE, one of the largest databases on natural catastrophes, has another set of ranking for the period 1999-2018 which is based on average values over a 20-year period. In the 1999 to 2018 period, Puerto Rico is the most vulnerable followed by Myanmar, Haiti, Phillipines and Pakistan. India is ranked 17 under long term vulnerability. Some European countries, such as France and Germany, also appear in the top 50 most vulnerable countries according to the 20 year risk index. “The appearance of some European countries among the bottom 30 countries can to a large extent be attributed to the extraordinary number of fatalities due to the 2003 heatwave, in which more than 70,000 people died across Europe. Although some of these countries are often hit by extreme events, the relative economic losses and the fatalities are usually relatively minor,” the analysis said. “The CRI 2020 clearly shows the devastating impacts of climate change induced extreme weather events. COP25 will put Loss and Damage prominently on the agenda as the body dealing with averting, minimizing and addressing Loss & Damage (the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage WIM) will be reviewed in Madrid for the second time,” the index said, adding that the review must come up with a mechanism to effectively assist vulnerable countries in dealing with loss. M Rajeevan Nair, secretary, ministry of earth sciences, had told HT on Wednesday that “India is facing changes in rainfall patterns due to climate change with prolonged dry spells and a higher frequency of extreme or very heavy rainfall events”. While 12 to 20 cm rain in a day comes under the category of Very heavy rainfall, extremely heavy rainfall is upwards of 20 cm in a day."

" Hot weather can cause a spike in the number of babies being born early, a phenomenon that may harm infant health and is likely to get worse as temperatures climb due to climate change, scientists said. Researchers in California said an average of 25,000 children were born up to two weeks early during warmer than average periods in the United States between 1969-1988 - equivalent to 150,000 lost gestational days annually. While it is not certain why mothers appear to go into labour early as the mercury climbs, the authors of the study published in Nature Research Journals said premature births was an issue to be taken seriously. “It is very likely that being born earlier will affect child development and have lasting impacts into adulthood, but more research is needed to confirm this,” Alan Barreca, from the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, University of California-Los Angeles. “Hot weather increases maternal levels of oxytocin, which is a key hormone that regulates labour and delivery. But, the link could be because hot weather causes cardiovascular stress, which might lead to early deliveries,” he told AFP. Barreca and a colleague used estimate shifts in daily birth rates from US counties over a 20-year span, a sample including 56 million births. They found that early birth rates increased by five percent on days where the temperature was above 90 degrees Farenheit (32.2 Celsius), accounting for around one out of every 200 births. With temperatures currently around 1C hotter than pre-industrial averages and set to increase further, Barreca said he was “very concerned” of the potential impacts of greater weather-linked early birth rates in future. “We predict more than 1 in 100 births will occur earlier than expected in the US by the end of the century,” he said. “That number may seem small, but that’s much higher than the risks of getting into a car accident.” He pointed out that while air conditioning was likely to provide mothers with protection during hot weather, the technology was energy-heavy, expensive, and largely absent in developing nations. “Some families will experience financial stress even if they are able to use more air conditioning during pregnancy, and financial stress is also bad for children,” he said. Andrew Shennan, professor of Obstetrics at King’s College London said that while extremes of temperature have long been linked to the risk of premature delivery, the nature of that link was unclear. “Given the wide variety of temperatures around the world, and that most women have normal pregnancies, this is unlikely to be an important risk factor for any individual,” said Shennan, who was not involved in the study.

" Days ahead of United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 25) at Madrid, a United Nations Environment Programme report has said with the current pledges to reduce carbon emissions there is a 66% chance that warming will be limited to 3.2 degree C by the end of this century. This would mean displacement, destruction owing to catastrophic climate change impacts in the coming decades across the world. The 2015 Paris Agreement has a goal of keeping global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Emissions Gap Report 2019 released on Tuesday said a “dramatic” strengthening of the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) is needed in 2020 to prevent dangerous climate change impacts. Countries will have to increase their NDC ambitions threefold to achieve the well below 2 degree C goal and more than five-fold to achieve the 1.5 degree C goal. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have risen at a rate of 1.5% per year in the last decade. There is no sign of GHG emissions peaking in the next few years after which they can start declining rapidly, the report said indicating a large gap in current emissions and action needed to avert climate change crisis. By 2030, emissions would need to be 25% and 55% lower than in 2018 to put the world on a pathway to meet the 2 degree C target. The G20 countries account for 78% of all emissions, but 7 of them do not have policies yet to achieve their current NDCs. On the progress of G20 economies, India along with China, the EU, Mexico, Russia and Turkey are on track to meet their goals, the report highlighted. Among them, India, Russia and Turkey are projected to over-achieve their NDC emission targets. “These results suggest that the three countries have room to raise their NDC ambition significantly. The EU has introduced climate legislation that achieves at least a 40% reduction in GHG emissions, which the European Commission projects could be overachieved if domestic legislation is fully implemented in member states,” the report said. The delay in arriving at a global consensus to limit global temperature rise to 2 degree C has led to a situation where countries will need to make large cuts in CO2 emissions immediately. The report projects that had climate action begun in 2010, the cuts required per year to meet the projected emissions levels for 2 degree C and 1.5 degree C would only have been 0.7% and 3.3% per year on average. Due to the delay in making an agreement the required cuts in emissions are now 2.7% per year from 2020 for the 2 degree C goal and about 7.6% per year on average for the 1.5 degree C goal. The World Meteorological Organisation on Monday said greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere had reached a record high in 2018. The globally averaged concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) reached 407.8 parts per million in 2018, up from 405.5 parts per million (ppm) in 2017. Since 1990, there has been a 43% increase in total radiative forcing – the warming effect on the climate by greenhouse gases. “There is no sign of a slowdown, let alone a decline, in greenhouse gases concentration in the atmosphere despite all the commitments under the Paris Agreement. It is worth recalling that the last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago. Back then, the temperature was 2-3 degree C warmer, sea level was 10-20 meters higher than now,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. Meanwhile, another report, “Can Climate Change-Fuelled Loss and Damage Ever Be Fair?” endorsed by nearly 100 civil society organisations released on Monday said that the US and EU are jointly responsible for more than half (54%) the cost of repairing the damage caused by climate disasters in the developing world."
" The Supreme Court, which ordered a ban on stubble burning in states around Delhi, on Monday lashed out at the Centre and the states for their failure to do anything to improve the quality of Delhi’s air. Ajay Mathur, TERI - The Energy & Resources Institute’s director general, speaks to Hindustan Times on Delhi’s air pollution, climate change and the forthcoming Conference of Parties in Spain. KD: At the Sustainable Dialogue on Air Pollution, you said Delhi’s air pollution is a solvable problem. What are the solutions (technology and finance)? AM: Air pollution in Delhi is a broad, year-round problem, and not just an episodic problem. We have put forward definitive measures for tackling both peak and non-peak pollution sources. Some of the peak air pollution episodes in Delhi can be avoided by preventing stubble burning in neighbouring states. Measures such as biomass aggregation by state/central authorities, creating a market for biomass briquettes, and converting crop residue into fuel to operate decentralised cold storage facilities will reduce the impact of crop burning by 40%. We also advise community burning of firecrackers by Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs), instead of individual use. To combat non-peak the sources, focus should be on switching to LPG in the residential sector, phasing out of pre-BS-IV private vehicles, transitioning to natural gas in industries, and effective mechanised sweeping to collect road dust. According to our assessment, these measures altogether can bring down Delhi’s PM 2.5 levels by 46% during winters. We don’t have a silver bullet; we need multiple actions by all stakeholders. Overall costs could be raised through green bonds by state/central government. These bonds can provide commercial loans to industries, while other stakeholders can receive subsidies/incentives. We believe that a five-year period is adequate to make the transition. KD: You are a member of the PM’s Council for Climate Change. Are Indian states doing enough to tackle climate crisis? Which are the areas where they need to improve? AM: Tackling climate change at the sub-national level in India is driven by naturally occurring events or it is an economics-driven energy choice. All states have a State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC), which clearly outlines the vulnerabilities that each state faces. All states are now going through the revision of respective SAPCCs. What we learn now from the first cycle of SAPCCs is the lack of sectoral actions and associated investment plans resulted in its poor implementation. The revision provides us with the opportunity to create sectoral plans, which include implementation and investment plan, unique to the state to have meaningful action at the state level. The other key issue at the state level is the poor access to finance, which proves to be a big impediment to any state or city-level action. KD: In the last few years, the impact on climate crisis has been visible across India, including urban areas, our economic engines. But many cities don’t seem to have a working climate change action plan.       "
  
         
             
              
           
      
" Mobile phone data, and census models can be used to effectively predict the spatial distribution of infectious diseases, according to a study in Singapore which showed that location information can be used for tracking epidemics without invading the privacy of cellphone users. The study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, compared different models of predicting people’s mobility, and concluded that having access to mobile phone location data can be crucial for understanding disease transmission dynamics. They said this data can ultimately aid in stopping an outbreak from evolving into an epidemic. The researchers, including those from Ecole polytechnique federale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, studied the relationship between human mobility and the 2013 and 2014 dengue outbreaks in Singapore. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), dengue prevalence has increased 30-fold worldwide over the past 50 years with 3.9 billion people in 128 countries -- almost half of the world’s population -- exposed to the virus. They found that even low levels of mobility can cause the epidemic to spread, underscoring the need for an effective spatial distribution model. “Urbanisation, mobility, globalisation and climate change could be all factors in the emergence of vector-borne diseases, even here in Europe,” said Emanuele Massaro, the study’s lead author and a scientist at EPFL. Massaro said most research, until now, examined how mobility affected the spread of infections in larger areas such as countries or regions. In the current study, he said, the researchers focused on the same question, but in towns and cities. “We also wanted to explore when people’s mobile phone location data might prove useful,” he added. Using an specific model in which humans and mosquitoes are represented as agents that go through the epidemic stages of dengue, the researchers compared how the system responded to an outbreak against actual reported cases from 2013 and 2014 in Singapore. They also compared four different mobility models, each using different datasets -- mobile phone location data, census records, random mobility, and theoretical assumptions. In each model, the citizens were assigned two locations - home and work - as places they visited daily and could potentially become infected. The mobile phone model was based on anonymised device data sourced from a Singaporean mobile operator, using call, text, and other activity records to pinpoint users’ home and work addresses, the researchers said. The researchers said phone location data is better than annual census records. However, they said, accessing information from citizens’ phones is a problem since the data is owned by private companies. “We need to think seriously about changing the law around accessing this kind of information - not just for scientific research, but for wider prevention and public health reasons,” Massaro said. The researchers said their model could equally be applied to other vector-borne diseases, such as malaria. (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

" Identifying health as the pre-eminent challenge facing India, Bill Gates, the co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation said: “If there was one wish I had for India, it would be to get rid of malnutrition because that reduces the potential of those kids so dramatically and their ability to provide and learn are reduced. It’s like 15 IQ points go away.” Speaking at the inaugural “Mint Visionaries” event in New Delhi where he was in conversation with Rishad Premji, chairman of Wipro Ltd, Gates said his favourite Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) was health. No prizes for guessing that since the former tech czar’s philanthropic venture—the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)—has global health as one of its key focus areas. SDGs are a collection of 17 global goals designed to be a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. Set in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly, the SDGs are intended to be achieved by the year 2030. Health is one of the important goals that aim to tackle major problems such as maternal and child mortality, and malnutrition. WATCH | Full Video: Bill Gates and Rishad Premji in conversation I Mint Visionaries Gates also spoke of the impact of vector-borne diseases such as dengue and malaria. “Malaria has been a major problem. To tackle this, we need more investment. Earlier, the poor countries were suffering because rich countries had the money and poor didn’t have the money to develop new tools to handle it” he said. Drawing a linkage between health and climate change, Gates said: “With climate change, as you heat the world up, mosquitoes can live in higher altitude. They will start thriving at the places where they never used to live.” The world malaria report released by the World Health Organization (WHO) in November 2018 also stated that India reported 3 million fewer cases in 2017, a 24% decrease compared with 2016. The report also said that India is on track to achieve a 20-40% reduction. Talking about BMGF’s work on healthcare, Gates said: “The biggest thing our foundation has done is getting vaccines for children around the world. Vaccine misinformation is worst today as it was ever.” He also said that with the help of technology, diseases such as cancer can be tackled via apps. During the event, Gates also spoke of the impact of climate change and emphasised the need for efforts to minimise emissions in the world. “Work on mitigation requires immense innovation. Electric cars in the next 10-15 years will outcompete gasoline cars without subsidy. We have to accelerate innovation which won’t come if we don’t step in. Middle-income countries cannot be left out.” “The work on mitigation requires immense innovation. We have a lot of inventions that need to be made. For example, steel and cement use a lot of energy. Climate change is a problem young people are waking up to. Climate change makes poor farmers suffer. Crops will fail every three years as against 7-8 (years earlier).” He added that all countries —whether low income or middle income—will have to participate in mitigating climate change because 60% of the world’s population lives in developing countries. “About 80% of the suffering from climate change is going to be poor farmers,” Gates warned. On the impact of social media and the responsibility of tech companies on tackling fake news, Gates said: “In the past, we all read the same newspaper. There may be a need to ban micro-targeting because it drives people apart. Society has to decide what these rules are.”"
" Microsoft founder and billionaire Bill Gates on Sunday said technology in its current form can free up our time but cannot tell us what we should do with that free time. Gates was speaking on ‘Technology for Social Inclusion’ as part of Mint Visionaries in New Delhi. A series of conversations with people who are torchbearers for a new future is what Mint Visionaries was all about. Mint held the first conversation with Bill Gates, co-chair, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Gates was in conversation with Rishad Premji, chairman, Wipro Ltd. They were later joined by Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog. “The world needs new technology that will let us generate energy without greenhouse gas emissions,” Gates said. Elaborating on the link between technology and climate change, the Microsoft founder said, “The world has to accelerate innovation to mitigate the risk of climate change.” WATCH | Full Video: Bill Gates and Rishad Premji in conversation I Mint Visionaries Referring to the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Gates emphasized that AI could give humanity some miracle tools, but at the same time the impact of AI on jobs is an important issue. “Electric cars in the next 10-15 years will outcompete gasoline cars without subsidy. We have to accelerate innovation which won’t come if we don’t step in,” Gates said while offering solutions to tackle climate change globally. Gates also mentioned that he is currently writing a book on climate change and that it should be published by June 2020. Gates is currently on a three-day visit to India to review the work of his foundation in the country. Gates also hailed India’s Aadhaar identification system as well as adoption of the UPI system in the country. In the last one decade, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has been working in areas of health-care, sanitation, agriculture and financial services for the underprivileged people in India."

" Forty years ago, scientists from 50 nations converged on Geneva to discuss what was then called the “CO2-climate problem.” At the time, with reliance on fossil fuels having helped trigger the 1979 oil crisis, they predicted global warming would eventually become a major environmental challenge. The scientists got to work, setting forth proposals on how to attack the problem, setting the stage for the eventual creation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s preeminent body of climate scientists. Their goal was to get ahead of the problem before it was too late. But after a fast start, the fossil fuel industry, politics and the prioritization of economic growth over planetary health slowed them down. Now, four decades later, a larger group of scientists is sounding another, much more urgent alarm. More than 11,000 experts from around the world are calling for a critical addition to the main strategy of dumping fossil fuels for renewable energy: there needs to be far fewer humans on the planet. “We declare, with more than 11,000 scientist signatories frown around the world, clearly and unequivocally that planet Earth is facing a climate emergency,” the scientists wrote in a stark warning published Tuesday in the journal BioScience. While warnings about the consequences of unchecked climate change have become so commonplace as to inure the average news consumer, this latest communique is exceptionally significant given the data that accompanies it. When absorbed in sequence, the charts lay out a devastating trend for planetary health. From meat consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and ice loss  to sea-level rise and extreme weather events, they lay out a grim portrait of 40 years of squandered opportunities. The scientists make specific calls for policymakers to quickly implement systemic change to energy, food, and economic policies. But they go one step further, into the politically fraught territory of population control. It “must be stabilized—and, ideally, gradually reduced—within a framework that ensures social integrity,” they write. The problem is enormous, yet the signatories still manage to strike an upbeat tone. For all the lost chances, progress is being made, they contend. “We are encouraged by a recent surge of concern,” the letter states. “Governmental bodies are making climate emergency declarations. Schoolchildren are striking. Ecocide lawsuits are proceeding in the courts. Grassroots citizen movements are demanding change, and many countries, states and provinces, cities, and businesses are responding.”"
    
               
         
        
        
     
    
           
            
           
" A month after the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) identified Mumbai as one of six Indian cities likely to be inundated by 2100, a follow-up study has found the impact of rising sea levels may be felt much sooner. In a latest study, published on Tuesday, American scientific research organisation Climate Central estimated that the Arabian Sea would begin flooding Mumbai by 2050. Globally, 150 million people may be at risk, says the study. “We need to take action in time to protect millions, and to avoid the economic and political upheaval that a climate disaster on this scale could bring,” said Dr. Benjamin Strauss, author of the study as well as chief scientist and chief executive officer, Climate Central. Climate Central’s study estimates that by 2050, the rise in sea level will push average annual coastal floods further inland. “The world’s coasts are more vulnerable to climate change than we ever thought. Now that we have a clearer picture of how much more land – and how many more people – may face coastal flooding in the foreseeable future, we can see not only what we stand to lose, but also what we have to gain by reducing emissions and avoiding the worst sea level rise projections,” said Dr. Benjamin Strauss, chief scientist and CEO, Climate Central and author of the latest study. Using artificial intelligence and satellite imagery to better understand land elevations, Climate Central has created revised projections for 2030, 2050, and 2100 under different emission scenarios (no emission cuts; medium emission cuts, and unchecked pollution levels). This is not the first time that environmentalists have raised an alarm about Mumbai’s vulnerability to inundation. In 2016, the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) estimated that nearly 40% of Mumbai could be underwater in the next 100 years if sea levels continue to rise. A 2017 study by Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) said the city could lose 25.32 sq km of its urban sprawl to coastal inundation caused by a 1m sea level rise by 2100. Last month, a report by the United Nations’ IPCC said the global mean sea level was projected to rise 10 times faster by 2100 if global greenhouse gas emissions are not curtailed, putting approximately 28 million people across Mumbai and five other Indian cities at risk. “The latest study reaffirms the IPCC report that this is going to be the new normal with nuanced extreme weather events such as cyclones as well as rising frequency of coastal inundation. It is high time for the state and central governments to take these warnings seriously and ensure urban planning and environmental planning goes hand in hand,” said Anjal Prakash, coordinating lead author of IPCC’s Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC). BN Patil, former director, Maharashtra environment department, drafted the state’s climate change action policy in October 2017. He said that 20-25% of Mumbai city and suburbs is “definitely under threat from submergence”. “Construction in low lying areas needs to be stopped. All natural ecosystems such as mangroves, wetlands, forests, and beaches need to be protected, and the coastal regulation zone (CRZ) norms also need to be followed in a stringent manner,” he said."
" Global warming is likely to increase illnesses caused by undernutrition, due to the effects of heat exposure, researchers have warned. For the study published in the journal PLOS Medicine, the researchers analysed daily hospitalisation data covering almost 80 per cent of Brazil between 2000 and 2015. They studied the link between daily mean temperatures and hospitalisation for undernourishment according to the International Classification of Diseases. “The association between increased heat and hospitalisation for undernutrition was greatest for individuals aged over 80, and those 5 to 19 years,” said the researchers from Monash University, Australia. The researchers found that for every 1°C increase in daily mean temperature during the hot season, there was a 2.5 per cent increase in the number of hospitalisations for undernutrition. “We estimated that 15.6 per cent of undernutrition hospitalisations could be attributed to heat exposure during the study period,” said study’s lead author Yuming Guo. The study said that increased heat may cause illness through undernourishment in a number of ways: reducing appetites, provoking more alcohol consumption, reducing motivation or ability to shop and cook and exacerbate any undernutrition, resulting in hospitalisation. “Climate change is one of the biggest threats to the reduction of hunger and undernutrition, especially in low and middle-income countries. It has been estimated that climate change will reduce global food availability by 3.2 per cent and thus cause about 30,000 underweight-related deaths by 2050,” the report said. “It is plausible to speculate that climate changes could not only increase the rate of undernutrition in the most affected areas of the globe, but at the same time, impair individuals’ capacity to adapt to projected rises in temperature,” said the researchers.

" In his recent remarks on Mahatma Gandhi and the contemporary world, United Nations (UN) Secretary-General António Guterres said, “Part of his genius lay in his ability to see the interconnectedness and the unity between all things. His political achievements included leading the movement that ended colonial rule in India, using peace, love and integrity to prevail. But his vision went far beyond politics to encompass human rights and sustainable development.” Today, I see how far we have come in the past century. After two terrible world wars, countries across Asia and Africa declared their independence. India won its freedom. And the India of today can be proud of its record of 17 successive free elections; of universal adult suffrage; of the abolition of untouchability; of the verve, passion and creativity that propel its young people towards enterprise and service, and much more. Much of this was inspired by Gandhi and the moral authority of his philosophy of satyagraha. Because, while Gandhi fought for India’s Independence, for the rights of his disenfranchised compatriots, he stood, through the sheer moral force of his example, for a hope shared by those weary of war — a hope of a better life. In his person and methods, India’s nationalism was, in effect, universalism. In over a century since Gandhi returned to India, a billion people have been lifted out of poverty, more babies are surviving to become adolescents, more children are going to school, fewer have to live in fear of being targeted because of their race or sexuality. But we cannot fail, in our appreciation for what has gone right, to recognise the ways in which we continue to fall short and, in some instances, have even reversed prior gains. Today, consensus enshrined in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights is fraying, even as the politics of fear and resentment takes root. Our world teeters on the brink of disaster brought on by anthropogenic climate change and unsustainable practices. Too many continue to go without, while too much is owned by too few. Privilege still determines opportunity. The structures of power and injustice Gandhi fought against mutated, but they are still there, creating yawning disparities in income, wealth, education, health, personal safety, access to finance and opportunity. And to set off once again on the path to greater prosperity and freedom for all, to leave no one behind, we must turn, once again, to Gandhi. If the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), that all nations are committed to achieving by 2030, are the world’s toughest to-do list, it is Gandhi who provides us with the tools to check the list off. These 17 SDGs mark a recognition of the interconnectedness of the challenges we face today — and we can only solve them together. Our old lenses do not quite fit — we need multifocals, perhaps, to look into the future, informed by the past, and grounded in the present. Gandhi’s endless innovation and tinkering, his reconciliation of tradition and a deeply egalitarian modernity, signpost the paths not yet taken — the ones we must now take. We’re already seeing how his ideas today, in the 21st century, effect massive change. India has channelled his image and emphasis on cleanliness to implement one of the largest sanitation drives in the world. Gandhi’s innovations in staging non-violent protest today inform social movements, from “Occupy” to “Fridays for Future”, in New Delhi and New York and everywhere in between. His concept of trusteeship finds echoes in our concerns about economic inequality — and of leaving no one behind. And his determination that the land we live off is not an inheritance from our forefathers, but in fact a loan from our children that we hold in trust for them, forms the core of modern ecological thought.

" New England is awash in historic markers, but a handful of plaques popping up in a New Hampshire town are different. Rather than commemorating important people or places in history, many of these dinner plate-size signs detail events like rising sea levels and an explosion of ticks that have yet to happen — part of an effort to draw attention to the potential effects of climate change. The signs are based on possibilities laid out in the scientific research that the towns have used to develop their climate plans and written from the perspective of someone in the 22nd century looking back. “The concept is to just really take that information that is on the websites and package it in a way to insert it into the landscape where people will bump into it,” said Northeastern University’s Thomas Starr, who came up with the project known as “Remembrance of Climate Futures.” He has placed 11 plaques in Durham, New Hampshire, six in Essex, Massachusetts, and is planning to install some in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as well. “There seems to be difficulty in getting people to engage in this issue,” he said. “We do hear about it fairly often. Yet, people don’t think of it in an immediate way.” Scientists have warned that global warming will result in rising seas and more heat waves, droughts, powerful storms, flooding and other problems. Many of the impacts can already be seen: The U.N.’s World Meteorological Organization released a report last month that showed that in the last several years warming, sea level rise and carbon pollution have all accelerated. Despite the dire warnings and growing acceptance that climate change is to blame for the increasing frequency of weather disasters, many Americans still see it as a problem affecting far-away places or a problem that their children or grandchildren will have to grapple with. To counter that apathy, Starr and others have turned to public art to get the message out that climate change is coming to New England communities. The markers imagine events like a boathouse destroyed in a storm surge from a Category 4 hurricane on Sept. 24, 2032, or a heat-inspired tick outbreak that forced a park to close on June 8, 2044. “We read on the news about the Arctic ice caps melting and impacts on polar bears,” said Durham’s Town Administrator Todd Selig. “But that is very hard for someone in Durham, New Hampshire, going about their busy life to relate to and to grasp.” Other markers are more hopeful, imagining commemorating how Durham switched to 100% renewable energy on July 20, 2040, or planted elm trees in May 2026 to reduce the urban heat effect. “It’s a good thing. At least we can say to our grandchildren that we did something,” said Adam Perkins, a tow truck driver from Durham, who was looking at a renewable energy plaque at town hall recently. Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program On Climate Change Communication, said the project is just one of several that is using innovative ways to bring the issue to the public.

" The possibility of coral reefs around India dying from increased bleaching, caused by rising sea surface temperatures, cannot be denied, admitted the Union environment ministry. The ministry said it has already started working on the protection of reefs. A 16-year study (2003-2019) by pan-India wildlife research body Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) and Wildlife Institute of India (WII) recorded that coral reefs in the Lakshadweep Islands were not only undergoing recurring bleaching, but are at the risk of widespread mortality, owing to a significant rise in average sea surface temperatures (SST). The BNHS will be alerting the Centre about its findings this month and is developing a detailed proposal to be submitted before the Union environment ministry and state governments, requesting coral transplantation and restoration measures. Coral reefs, formed by millions of tiny polyps along ocean floors, are home to a large marine biodiversity and are considered rainforests of the ocean as they sequester large amounts of carbon— a means to reduce climate change. “Coral-reef bleaching has become a phenomenon, which is now happening regularly. Corals can be damaged by two things – high turbidity in water and changes in temperature. The BNHS study could be correct as sea surface temperatures are being regularly observed, and the possibility of future coral mortality cannot be denied,” said MS Negi, additional director general of forest (wildlife), Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC). “We need to use temperature-tolerant coral species from the Gulf of Kutch as an insurance to deal with severe SST anomalies,” said Deepak Apte, director, BNHS. Negi added that MoEFCC will assess the findings of the BNHS study after receiving its proposal. “We will be considering the study. Climate change is affecting every sector and is forcing all agencies to make changes in strategies for conservation. Coral protection is a priority . We are already working on coral transplantation and building artificial reefs,” he said."
                
        
" Founder of Microsoft Corporation and American philanthropist Bill Gates’ new book will be about climate change, and will look at possible solutions to prevent an environmental crisis, UK-based publishing house Allen Lane has announced. In “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need”, Gates will explain why he cares so deeply about climate change and what makes him optimistic that the world can prevent the worst impacts of the climate crisis. “Climate change is a unique global problem. I am writing this book to help identify how we can work on a local, national, and global level to build the technologies, businesses, and industries to avoid the worst impacts of climate change,” Gates said. In the book, he will share what he has learned in over a decade of studying climate change, and investing in innovations to address the problems. “As a technologist, he has seen first-hand how innovation can change the world. By investing in research, inventing new technologies, and by deploying them quickly at large scale, Gates believes climate change can be addressed in meaningful ways,” publishers said in a statement. The author’s interest in climate change is a natural outgrowth of the efforts by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to reduce poverty and disease. Climate change, according to him, will have the biggest impact on the people who have done the least to cause it. According to Allen Lane, the book will set out a vision for how the world can work to build the tools it needs to get to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. “To prevent the worst effects of climate change, we have to get to net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases. This problem is urgent, and the debate is complex, but I believe we can come together to invent new carbon-zero technologies, deploy the ones we have, and ultimately avoid a climate catastrophe,” Gates said. “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need” will hot stands on June 24, 2020.

" To reduce dependency on non-renewable energies and promote self-sustaining ones, the government will soon aim to turn energy consumers into ‘prosumers’, said Union Minister for Power and Energy,R K Singh at a media briefing following the inauguration of a conference on power and new and renewable energy in Gujarat’s Kevadia town on Friday. “Prosumers” will be those who generate energy from renewable sources and their interests will be protected by a slew of imminent regulations. The two-day conference is the first of its kind to be held, after the nation achieved near-universal household electrification under the Saubhagya scheme, wherein 26.6 million households were connected in a record time of under two years. The power and energy ministers and secretaries from all states and union territories are participants. “We are going to come out with regulations which lay down the rights of consumers and those of ‘prosumers’,” Singh said. “Earlier, there were only consumers of electricity. Now there will be “prosumers”, who produce energy, consume it and take additional requirements from the grid. We want everyone to be a ‘prosumer’. The Union Minister also told his state counterparts to clear the dues of power producers (including solar and wind energy) through the distribution companies (Discoms) of each state. “Today, the outstanding dues for generating companies amounts to Rs 59,000 crore. If the ease of doing business, the sanctity of contracts and the certainty of payments are assured, players will set up generation units,” he said. Both the Centre and states are also aiming at pre-paid smart cards for electricity consumers within the next three years. “Some states want to do it within a year. But overall, we have set a target of three years to roll this out across the country,” Singh said, pointing out the benefits of smart cards for all stake-holders including discoms, poor consumers and generating companies. On the concept of “one-nation, one-tariff,” the union power minister said that the idea has been brought to the attention of the government but that it is yet to be studied. “We have different forms of generation, gas, hydro, coal, renewable and a pooled power cost. Therefore, such ideas need to be examined.” Singh also said that the ongoing conference will see discussions on the viability of systems and structures and on how to make them sustainable. “The end result is going to be a power system which is viable, sustainable, provides supply round the clock, offers ease of doing business and provides the consumer a choice to reduce the price of electricity. This is our objective and we will achieve it,” Singh said. The minister also noted that climate change had become a major concern the world over and that India is committed to fight it in every possible way. Talking of climate change, the Minister said that it has become a major concern world over and India is committed to fight climate change in every possible way. Mentioning KUSUM scheme (what is this scheme?), he said that it would enable farming pumps to run on solar energy in the coming years."
              
    
          
                 
                        
        
                          
" The Swaraj India Party on Saturday released its manifesto ‘Iman Patra’, promising employment for 20 lakh people for an additional expenditure of ₹20,000 crore annually. The party, which was floated three years ago by Yogendra Yadav and other activists following their expulsion from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), is contesting on 28 of the total 90 seats in the upcoming assembly polls in Haryana. Briefing mediapersons, Yadav, who is the party’s national president, said the manifesto document was so named as it was the conviction of the party to thus build a constructive future of the state. Announcing seven missions of seven dimensions of life, Yadav, who was accompanied by state president Rajeev Godara, said a solid foundation of education would be laid for every child from the age of three to the third grade. Through this, 73,000 new jobs would be created in the state. Spelling out details of healthy Haryana mission, he said its focus would be to protect the people from malnutrition, disease and intoxication. On another mission, he said that increasing the farmers’ income would prevent migration from farming, which would prevent 90,000 people from joining the army of unemployed every year. “Every farmer will be given one and a half times the minimum support price of the entire cost of his crop (C2 cost of Haryana farmer),” he said. Yadav also said a campaign would be launched to save the state from the threat of climate change by increasing the forest and saving water, through which partial employment would be provided to 5 lakh families."
        
" As the dust settles from last week’s much-discussed United Nations Climate Action Summit, the most remarkable ensuing climate news has little to do with the activities in New York. The summit followed a predictable path, with a mix of encouraging country and private sector pronouncements and a conspicuous silence from many large emitters. Seventy-seven countries, 10 regions, and 100 cities committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The United States, Australia, and Brazil, on the other hand, were absent from the stage. Instead, the unexpected and inspiring news is ancillary to the summit. We are witnessing a global wave of climate strikes that are demanding more action on the climate emergency. The largest of these had six million people, from countries around the world, who united in their message momentarily erased the diplomatic boundaries between developed and developing nations, which have long beset the international climate negotiations. The images spanning Jakarta, Nairobi, Mexico City, Sao Paulo – and closer to home in Chennai, Mumbai, New Delhi, Kolkata – are striking, not least because these are cities with multiple development challenges and seemingly more immediate priorities (jobs, electricity, housing), as opposed to the more abstract and longer-term concerns of climate change. But the clear message from this growing public sentiment is that protecting the environment is no longer an issue for the future, nor is it one which is solely salient in UN corridors. Rather, it has pressing effects on everyday lives. Could this shift mean we are moving towards a tipping point in how climate actions are undertaken? The reason it is important to ask this question is that tackling the climate crisis is not a task for heads of countries alone. In fact, any success towards the global temperature 2°Celsius target, laid out in the Paris Agreement, is inextricably dependent on how actions towards this goal will filter down from nations to cities, households, and individuals. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1.5°C report states, there are only two pathways to achieve the global temperature target: One, by drastically reducing global energy demand; or two, by the use of negative emission technologies (including bio-energy with carbon capture and storage), which reduce carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. While the latter technologies are almost entirely in the demonstration phase without being available at scale, the former option – reduction in energy demand – is both technologically feasible and cost-effective. The catch, however, is that it requires untangling the complex ways in which energy consumption is embedded in our daily lives. The majority of energy services are used within four broad categories. These are in buildings, transportation, food, and commodities. The provision of services within each of these areas is core to a better quality of life, which is important for regions starting from a low base of development. At the same time, the scale of current and future energy consumption poses difficult challenges for climate change because of its trade-offs with higher greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, cooling, especially from air conditioners, is expected to grow exponentially to require the equivalent of all electricity demand in the US and Germany today. Reducing energy demand, thereby, requires a fundamental examination of our everyday consumption patterns, and in turn, of our lifestyles and underlying social norms. Changing these is arguably a more difficult task than an ostensible technological fix to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Yet, simultaneously, the opportunity to tackle climate change by focusing on energy demand also locates the solution space within our everyday lives. The use of energy efficient appliances, reduced meat consumption, public transport use, and the reduction of waste, are key examples. These solutions are even more relevant for emerging economies, where most of the infrastructure – which shapes preferences – is yet to be built. For instance, net-zero architectural designs or the availability of reliable public transit can significantly reduce, and even remove, the need for energy consumption for lighting, thermal comfort, and private vehicles. The latest science tells us that we are already at 1.1°C of warming, and at the current rate, the earth is 15-20 years away from reaching 1.5°C. Halting temperature increase well below 2°C at this stage will require a range of solution pathways. Within this set, demand-side options are well understood and widely available. But their uptake and acceptability is difficult because they require more than technological shifts, and instead, call for a transition in our material realities and deeply embedded individual behaviours. Perhaps the most heartening message from the recent climate news is that as individuals and societies we are beginning to recognise that tackling the climate emergency is one in which we can all play a part.As geographer Mike Hulme has succinctly said, climate change is not so much a discrete problem to be solved as it is a condition under which human beings are to make choices about the way we live and govern ourselves.

" On the eve of the September UN Climate Action Summit, young women and men around the world mobilized by the millions and told global leaders: “You are failing us”. They are right. Global emissions are increasing. Temperatures are rising. The consequences for oceans, forests, weather patterns, biodiversity, food production, water, jobs and, ultimately, lives, are already dire — and set to get much worse. The science is undeniable. But in many places, people don’t need a chart or graph to understand the climate crisis. They can simply look out the window. Climate chaos is playing out in real time from California to the Caribbean, and from Africa to the Arctic and beyond. Those who contributed least to the problem are suffering the most. I have seen it with my own eyes from cyclone-battered Mozambique to the hurricane-devastated Bahamas to the rising seas of the South Pacific. I called the Climate Action Summit to serve as a springboard to set us on the right path ahead of crucial 2020 deadlines established by the Paris Agreement on climate change. And many leaders — from many countries and sectors — stepped up. A broad coalition -- not just governments and youth, but businesses, cities, investors and civil society — came together to move in the direction our world so desperately needs to avert climate catastrophe. More than seventy countries committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, even if major emitters have not yet done so. More than 100 cities did the same, including several of the world’s largest. At least seventy countries announced their intention to boost their national plans under the Paris agreement by 2020. Small Island States together committed to achieve carbon neutrality and to move to 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030. Countries from Pakistan to Guatemala, Colombia to Nigeria, New Zealand to Barbados vowed to plant more than 11 billion trees. More than 100 leaders in the private sector committed to accelerating their move into the green economy. A group of the world’s largest asset-owners — responsible for directing more than $2 trillion — pledged to move to carbon-neutral investment portfolios by 2050. This is in addition to a recent call by asset managers representing nearly half the world’s invested capital – some $34 trillion – for global leaders to put a meaningful price on carbon and phase out fossil fuel subsidies and thermal coal power worldwide. The International Development Finance Club pledged to mobilize $1 trillion in clean energy funding by 2025 in 20 least developed countries. One-third of the global banking sector signed up to align their businesses with the Paris agreement objectives and Sustainable Development Goals. The Summit also showcased ways in which cities and global industries like shipping can achieve major reductions in emissions. Initiatives to protect forests and safeguard water supplies were also highlighted. These steps are all important — but they are not sufficient. From the beginning, the Summit was designed to jolt the world and accelerate action on a wider scale. It also served as a global stage for hard truths and to shine a light on those who are leading and those who are not. Deniers or major emitters have nowhere to hide. I will continue to encourage them to do much more at home and drive green economic solutions around the world. Our planet needs action on a truly planetary scale. That cannot be achieved overnight, and it cannot happen without the full engagement of those contributing most to the crisis. If our world is to avoid the climate cliff, far more is needed to heed the call of science and cut greenhouse emissions by 45 percent by 2030; reach carbon neutrality by 2050; and limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees by the end of the century. That’s how we can secure the future of our world. Too many countries still seem to be addicted to coal – even though cheaper, greener options are available already. We need much more progress on carbon pricing, ensuring no new coal plants by 2020, and ending trillions of dollars in giveaways of hard-earned taxpayers’ money to a dying fossil fuel industry to boost hurricanes, spread tropical diseases, and heighten conflict. At the same time, developed countries must fulfill their commitment to provide $100 billion a year from public and private sources by 2020 for mitigation and adaptation in developing countries. And I will make sure that the commitments that countries, the private sector and local authorities have made are accounted for -- starting in December at the UN Climate conference in Santiago, Chile. The UN is united in support of realizing these initiatives. Climate change is the defining issue of our time. Science tells us that on our current path, we face at least 3 degrees Celsius of global heating by the end of the century. I will not be there, but my granddaughters will. I refuse to be an accomplice in the destruction of their one and only home. Young people, the UN – and a growing number of leaders from business, finance, government, and civil society – in short, many of us – are mobilizing and acting. But we need many others to take climate action if we are to succeed. We have a long way to go. But the movement has begun. António Guterres is Secretary-General of the United Nations."
" The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has accorded administrative approval for release of 200 cubic feet per second (cusecs) of fresh water daily from the Sirhind canal to the Neelon drain to bring down the pollution levels in the Buddha Nullah. As per the plan, an outlet from the canal will be made to the Neelon drain, which runs parallel to it. The water released into the drain will then meet the nullah near Koomkalan village, around 27km from the city. The ₹5.7-crore project, which will be executed by the department of water resources, will commence in December and is expected to complete by November 2020. The cost of the project will be borne jointly by the PPCB and the Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) under the Smart City project. As per officials of the PPCB, the project will ultimately help in reducing the pollution in Buddha Nullah and the Sutlej. As per the action plan for Clean River Sutlej 2019, prepared by the Directorate of Environment and Climate change, department of science and technology, of the 2,423 industrial units in Punjab polluting the Sutlej, the majority, 2,028, are in Ludhiana, including 228 dyeing and 1,649 electroplating and surface treatment units which directly or indirectly release untreated waste in Buddha Nullah. Ludhiana deputy commissioner Pradeep Kumar Agrawal said since the nullah is a non-perennial water body, it does not have sufficient assimilation capacity to achieve Class B quality water even after implementation of measures. Class A quality water is filtered and fit for drinking. Class B is fit for washing and bathing purposes. “At least 200 cusecs from Sirhind canal are needed to achieve Class B quality of water in the nullah,” Agrawal said. Funding The payment of ₹2.8 crore on part of the Punjab Pollution Control Board will be released to the department of water resources in four instalments as under subject to the certification of utilisation of funds by the department. While the first instalment of ₹87.5 lakh has been released, the second and third instalments of ₹75 lakh each and the fourth of ₹50 lakh will be payable after four-month interval as the project proceeds. How project took shape The Directorate of Environment and Climate Change had notified the Clean River Sutlej 2019 on January 31 this year. As per the plan, there was a need to release at least 200 cusecs from Sirhind canal to achieve the required quality of water meant for organised outdoor bathing in the nullah. A monitoring committee constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had directed the department of water resources to finalise the proposal for release of into the nullah through the Neelon drain. During the fifth meeting of the committee held on July 23 this year, the PPCB and the Ludhiana MC had jointly agreed to fund the project on 50:50 basis. The matter is also being reviewed by the river rejuvenation committee (RRC) constituted in accordance with the mandate of the order passed by the NGT. PPCB , MC tussle"

" British designer Stella McCartney pleaded for fashion to “wake up” and help save the planet Monday after her first Paris show as part of the industry’s biggest luxury conglomerate. “The world is crying out for change and it is our responsibility to act now,” said the creator, whose label is a pioneer of ethical fashion. “We aren’t perfect... and like all businesses, we are part of the problem,” McCartney admitted. “But we are pushing the boundaries every day to find solutions that do exist in an industry desperately in need of change.”   Look 22 #StellaSummer20⁣ ⁣ Inspired by fierce women, past present and future, who aren’t afraid to make the world their own, this is our most sustainable collection ever! x Stella⁣ ⁣ #StellaMcCartney A post shared by Stella McCartney (@stellamccartney) on Sep 30, 2019 at 10:25am PDT Her comments come days after LVHM’s billionaire owner, Bernard Arnault -- the second richest man in the world -- attacked Greta Thunberg at the launch of his group’s environmental drive. He accused the Swedish teenager of “surrendering to total catastrophism” over climate change and depressing young people.

The designer has become Arnault’s personal advisor on sustainability since he bought into her brand in July, although she remains the majority shareholder. Arnault’s LVMH group, whose huge stable of luxury brands includes Dior, Louis Vuitton and Givenchy, is seen as lagging behind its French rival Kering. Last week Kering -- which owns Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen -- said it had gone carbon neutral and would half the greenhouse gas emissions in its supply chain within five years. LVMH refused to join with Kering in signing “The Fashion Pact” on the fighting climate change at the G7 summit last month. Kering owned half of McCartney’s label until she bought them out last year. McCartney said it was time brands got serious about the climate emergency, saying, “It’s time to wake up.”   Look 34 #StellaSummer20⁣ ⁣ Inspired by fierce women, past present and future, who aren’t afraid to make the world their own, this is our most sustainable collection ever! x Stella⁣ ⁣⁣⁣⁣ #StellaMcCartney A post shared by Stella McCartney (@stellamccartney) on Sep 30, 2019 at 10:52am PDT - ‘Not just a trend’ - Sustainability “is the future of fashion, not just a trend”, she said. “The younger generation are standing up and telling us that our house is on fire and that we need to respond like we are in a crisis, because in fact it is a crisis,” she said. The vegetarian said that she had never used fur, leather, skins, feathers or animal glues since she founded her label in 2001. To the sound of Donna’s Summer’s Love to Love You Baby, McCartney projected images of coupling pangolins, Artic foxes and other endangered species onto the Belle Epoque ceilings of the Opera Garnier in Paris. Clips of zebras, ostriches and elephants also getting up to some monkey business helped get fashionistas in the mood. McCartney said her classy spring summer collection was “the most sustainable ever” and included raffia bags made by female artisans in Madagascar, with the material coming from communities fighting deforestation. It also included a luxurious-feeling new fake fur called Koba, made from plant-based plastics and recycled polyester, and shoes with sustainable wooden heels and sneakers made from “second life plastic”. The designer -- daughter of Beatle Paul McCartney and animal rights activist Linda McCartney -- listed her long record of finding environmentally friendly alternative materials in a lengthy press release to go with the show. With Kaia Gerber -- the daughter of 1990s supermodel Cindy Crawford -- wearing one of a series of ingenious flower print dresses, the catwalk was dominated by elegant lace and Mughal crenellation fringed creations.

" In a wake-up call to world leaders, an intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) report has said since 1993 the rate of ocean warming has more than doubled, intense marine heat waves have also doubled in frequency since 1982, receding glaciers and ice sheets have increased the rate of sea level rise—rising twice as fast compared to the 20th century. Underlining the urgency to act, the “Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate” by IPCC which has assessed research on the state of glaciers, oceans and marine ecosystems has projected that global glacier mass loss in the next few decades till 2050 will increase river runoff and related hazards like landslides, avalanches and floods. Also read: It is time to act on the climate threat Marine heat waves and extreme El Nino (when sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean rise to above normal levels) and La Nina (when sea surface temperatures in central Pacific Ocean drop to below normal) will become frequent. Extreme sea level events that are historically rare occurring once per century in the recent past are projected to occur at least once a year at many locations, particularly the tropical region by 2050. Till now the oceans have absorbed about 20 to 30% of human induced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and 90% of excess heat in the climate system since the 1980s causing ocean acidification. Ocean heat and acidification has led to shifts in the distribution of fish populations and has already reduced the global catch potential. “In the future, some regions, notably tropical oceans, will see further decreases, but there will be increases in others, such as the Arctic. Communities that depend highly on seafood may face risks to nutritional health and food security,” the report states. Also read: Industry to go low-carbon path to fight climate change: Prakash Javadekar The extent of Arctic sea ice is declining in every month of the year. If global warming is stabilized at 1.5 degree C above pre-industrial levels, the Arctic ocean would only be ice-free in September once in every hundred years. For global warming of 2 degree C, this would occur up to one year in three, the report warns. About 670 million people in high mountain regions, 680 million people in low-lying coastal areas, four million people in the Arctic region, 65 million people in small islands are exposed to these extreme events. Without major investments in adaptation, they would be further exposed to escalating flood risks, the report shows. Some island nations are likely to become uninhabitable due to climate change but habitability thresholds remain extremely difficult to assess say authors. “We will only be able to keep global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels if we effect unprecedented transitions in all aspects of society, including energy, land and ecosystems, urban and infrastructure as well as industry. The ambitious climate policies and emissions reductions required to deliver the Paris Agreement will also protect the ocean and cryosphere and ultimately sustain all life on earth,” said Debra Roberts, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group II."

" This is the season of trade threats. There was much consternation about President Trump’s tweet two months earlier that “India has long had a field day putting tariffs on American products. No longer acceptable!”. This came in the wake of retaliatory tariffs slapped by India in response to the US’s termination of India’s participation in the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). On the horizon, though, are more ominous threats from developed countries with the intent of prodding India to substantially enhance its commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement to address climate change and global warming. These may take the shape of tariffs and non-tariff barriers on Indian exports. International aid flows and concessional finance will be impacted, as will foreign portfolio investments influenced by new regulatory requirements in markets like the European Union (EU). The damage to India’s economic interests could be large, even as Corporate India struggles to adapt to climate change and find new opportunities for growth. The international community is beginning to ask searching questions about the role that developing countries play in the fight against climate change. India is the third largest producer in the world of climate change inducing greenhouse gas emissions, after China and the US. At various international fora, including the forthcoming Climate Action Summit called by the United Nations Secretary General next week, India’s actions to curb the growth of greenhouse gases will be under scrutiny. India’s commitments under the Paris Climate Treaty, including the reduction of the carbon intensity of its GDP by 33-35% by 2030, and the generation of 40% of its energy from renewable sources, will in fact not yield a decline in greenhouse gas production; with the targeted economic expansion outlined in the recent Economic Survey, greenhouse gas production is slated to increase in India. Meanwhile, compensating short-term goals set by the government, including the promise to create 100 GW of solar power capacity by 2022, appear very difficult to achieve given the current run-rate. Unfortunately, India’s growing emissions come at a time when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has concluded that global emissions need to fall by 45% from 1990 levels by 2030 to constrain the worst impacts of global warming. These impacts – including unbearable heat waves, extreme climatic events like torrential rainfall as well as drought, changes in cropping patterns, and sea level rise – are already being felt across the globe. Cities like Paris and New York, as well as the UK Parliament, have declared “climate emergencies”, and a green surge was visible in the recent European Parliamentary elections. The responses that are taking shape include the European Commission’s Draft Rules for an EU framework which puts Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations at the heart of the financial system; these will soon require all asset managers to disclose the ESG performance of their investment portfolios. Consequently, corporates that are non-compliant on issues like reducing their carbon footprint will be progressively excluded from the investment portfolios of the largest fund managers in the world. The recent action by Norway’s sovereign wealth fund to dump fossil fuel stocks is a sign of things to come. Guided by regulation, corporates in the developed countries will also start excluding from their supply chains companies in the developing world that are non-compliant with climate change mitigation standards. Likewise, on international aid, statements from Britain’s Department for International Development indicate a relook at aid spending to incorporate measures like resilience to climate change and reducing environmental harm. It is only a matter of time before international trade flows, and the levers they offer to influence the climate agenda, start receiving the attention of Western governments. The Indian government and the corporate sector are key stakeholders who will have to work hard to defend India’s position. The government will rightly argue climate ethics – the unfairness of asking developing countries that have major developmental challenges to embrace structural changes to solve the problem of climate change that has, at least in terms of legacy greenhouse gas emissions, been predominantly caused by the developed world. Indeed, on per capita emissions, India falls well over 100 places in the world rankings of biggest greenhouse gas producers. Hence the government’s emphasis on the “common but differentiated responsibility” of developing countries. It will also highlight the gross inadequacy of financial flows and technology assistance from the developed countries to the developing countries. Grants, loans and project finance of $100 Bn a year to tackle climate change have been long promised by developed countries, but only around 20% of this amount currently flows to developing countries. The Indian corporate sector, meanwhile, must demonstrate greater resource use efficiency, and invest in both greenhouse gas mitigation and climate adaptation. Awareness is certainly increasing, with events like the Chennai floods of 2015, which disrupted business continuity at some of India’s largest IT campuses, vividly bringing home the damage climate change can cause. The risks of business model disruption and stranded assets in major sectors of the economy like automobiles, power and construction are high. Witness the agitated reactions of two-wheeler companies to the Niti Ayog’s proposed 2025 deadline for full migration to electric two-wheelers. Corporate India needs to step up its investments on R&D and innovation, in order to adapt to the disruptive changes ahead, and to tap the opportunities presenting themselves in emerging spaces like electric mobility, renewable energy, waste management, and green buildings. We are in the midst of a climate emergency which can stimulate irrational actions on the part of developed countries. India will have to substantially enhance its focus on climate risks, and seek international support. If the transition is not managed well, India could emerge as the villain of the piece, rather than one of the biggest victims of climate change.

" A new global survey of retiree well-being paints a bleak picture for Americans hoping for an old age free of financial stress. A separate report on the impact of global warming makes it even worse. The 2019 Global Retirement Index released Thursday by Natixis Investment Managers cites a trifecta of risks for retirees, policymakers and long-term global sustainability: low interest rates, longer lifespans and the high costs of climate change.  The constant struggle to get by on a fixed income is likely pushing down the U.S. score in one of four broad categories the index measures: material well-being. The U.S. scored 58% overall, down from last year’s 61%, and dropped two spots in the overall country ranking, to No. 18. The nation’s low rank for income equality (37th worst of 44 countries) is partially to blame.  With income streams low, retirees may move into riskier assets in a bid to make up for a shortfall in income. “Many retirees may not have the time they need to recoup any losses due to a market downturn,” the report by Natxis noted. Health care is often one of the largest expenses for American retirees. A new study by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, and the University of California, San Francisco calculated that 10 climate-sensitive events in 2012—such as wildfires, extreme heat and Hurricane Sandy—played an outsized role in this dynamic, leading to more than $10 billion in health-related costs.  Severe weather that forces retirees to relocate, even temporarily, can be very disruptive for someone living on a fixed income, said Ed Farrington, executive vice president of Retirement Strategies at Natixis. The group’s report stated that “retirees are finding insurance costs escalating as insurers seek to keep pace with climate and weather-related property damage.” There are a few glimmers of hope, however. A separate Natixis survey found that 64% of millennials actively seek investments aligned with their values, compared with 43% of baby boomers, and that 59% want to make a positive social or environmental impact when they invest, versus 48% for boomers. Such numbers may encourage more opportunities to put money in planet-saving investments.  “You get the economy you invest in,” said Garvin Jabusch, co-founder of Green Alpha Investors.

" Most developed nations and some developing countries, numbering 14, responsible for 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions, have declined to revise their nationally determined contribution (NDCs) to meet the 2015 Paris Agreement target of keeping global mean temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. Days ahead of the crucial UN Climate Action Summit in New York, a report by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), titled The Heat is On: Taking Stock of Global Climate Action, said that most developing nations, including the most vulnerable small island nations, have said they will enhance their ambition to meet the Paris target. The report underlines that developed countries are not rising to the challenge and are set to risk breaching the 2 degree global warming target, a dangerous threshold, according to the scientists in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). At least 112 nations accounting for 53% of the global emissions have expressed the intention to update their NDCs. “However, this includes many of the developing countries that are the most vulnerable to, but least responsible for, climate change,” said a statement by UNDP on Wednesday. One hundred and eighty four out of 197 parties to the Paris Agreement have submitted their first set of NDCs so far. Within this group of 112 nations, 75 countries representing 37% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions “are leading the way with intentions to enhance their ambition in their next NDCs –either by curbing emissions, or including measures to make societies more resilient to the worsening impacts of climate change, or both. In fact, two countries have already complied with the deadline--the Marshall Islands and Ecuador, the report said. The report doesn’t name the countries which have declined to update NDCs but has cited examples of countries that are taking a leadership role like Marshall Islands, Ethiopia which has an NDC compatible with the 2 degree target, Chile which is phasing out coal, and Morocco, which is aligned to a 1.5 degree rise in temperature. More industrialized nations, meanwhile, are among the 53 countries currently working on long-term strategies (LTS), which they intend to submit by the end of 2020, that describe the phasing out of GHGs from their economies by the second half of the century, the report said. Europe’s Green Deal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 will be outlined in the coming months, for example. The Marshall Islands, comprising 29 low-lying coral atolls in the Pacific Ocean, was the first nation to issue a new NDC last year aimed at reducing vulnerability to storms and sea level rise while cutting the use of fossil fuels. “The government says the nation accounts for a miniscule 0.00001 percent of global emissions but wants to show leadership since it is so exposed to storms, “king tides” and rising sea levels,” the report said. India, in a finance ministry discussion paper released on Tuesday, stated that it doesn’t intend to immediately enhance its NDC, which is already aligned to the 2 degree target. Meanwhile, an analysis by Carboncopy, a communications group, said that since the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015, 35 Indian companies including Tata group, Mahindra and Mahindra, Dalmia Cement and Ambuja Cement had committed to reducing emissions through science-based targets, pushing India to the 5th position after the United States (121), Japan (80), United Kingdom (73), and France (46). These companies have a net worth of $87 billion.

" Prime Minister Narendra Modi will deliver the keynote address at the Bloomberg Global Business Forum (GBF) in New York on September 25 during his visit to the US to attend the UN General Assembly meetings. The GBF, a day-long event that attracts scores of CEOs and heads of state and government, will open with Modi’s address, which will be followed by a conversation between the prime minister and businessman and philanthropist Michael Bloomberg that will focus on strengthening global economic stability, tackling climate change and advancing technologies that can improve society. The GBF will also feature New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, former US presidents George W Bush and Bill Clinton and Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger. Modi’s visit to the US during September 21-27 will also take him to Houston, where he will address an Indian community event and join a roundtable of energy company CEOs. He is expected to address the UN General Assembly on September 27, the same day as his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan. According to the list of speakers for the general debate at the session, Khan is expected to speak after Modi. This will be Modi’s first address to the world body during his second term. Modi is also expected to hold several bilateral and multilateral meetings on the margins of the General Assembly session, including one with US President Donald Trump, although no dates have been formally announced by the two sides."
                                           
             
" Consumers worried about the environment are cutting their spending on meat and bottled drinks and trying to reduce plastic waste, and this trend is set to accelerate as climate concerns mount, a global survey showed on Tuesday. About a third of people surveyed in 24 countries in Europe, Latin America and Asia are alarmed about the environment, with half of those - or 16% of the global total - taking active steps to reduce their imprint. “We’re already seeing small reductions in spending on meat, bottled drinks and categories such as beauty wipes,” data analytics firm Kantar said in a report on the survey. “As markets get wealthier, the focus on issues of environmentalism and plastics increases. In the future, we could expect to see the share of ‘eco active’ shoppers rising in countries that experience growing gross domestic product.” The poll of more than 65,000 people showed that consumers in western Europe were most likely to seek to reduce their environmental impact, while a majority of the population in Asia and Latin America has little to no interest in the issue. Chile is the exception in Latin America and the country with the most environmentally engaged consumers in the world, with 37% of those surveyed actively taking trying to make a change. Austria and Germany have the next most concerned shoppers, with Britain not far behind, Kantar said, predicting that sales of fresh meat in Britain could drop by up to 4% in the next two years if environmentalism keeps spreading. “Our study shows there is high demand for eco-friendly products that are competitively priced and readily available.” The U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said last month that global meat consumption must fall to curb global warming and that plant-based foods could contribute to reducing emissions of carbon dioxide. There has been an explosion of companies offering alternatives to meat, such as California-based Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, while food giants like Nestle are also launching plant-based burgers. Kantar said 48% of shoppers want consumer goods companies to do more to cut plastic waste. It noted that dozens of companies - including giants like Nestle, Coca-Cola, Unilever, Walmart and Carrefour - have signed a pledge to make their packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025.

" A new report has called on the world leaders to invest in climate change adaptation measures urgently citing various imperatives, including high rate of return on such investments which make countries resilient. The research finds that investing 1.8 trillion dollars globally in five years between 2020 and 2030 could generate 7.1 trillion dollars in net benefits. The report by the Global Commission on Adaptation called “Adapt Now: A Gobal Call for Leadership on Climate Resilience” cites three important reasons why the world should prepare to adapt to climate change—without adaptation, climate change could depress growth in agricultural yields by 30%, number of people who may lack sufficient water, at least one month per year, will rise from 3.6 billion to more than 5 billion by 2050 and rising seas could force hundreds of millions of people in coastal cities from their homes, with a total cost to coastal urban areas of more than $1 trillion each year by 2050, the report has estimated. Climate change could also push more than 100 million people within developing countries below the poverty line by 2030. The report which was simultaneously launched at the COP14 at Greater Noida and Berlin on Tuesday said early warning systems, infrastructure that can withstand rising sea levels and extreme weather, and boosting agriculture to cope with droughts, bolstering scarce water resources and improving mangrove forests that provide key protection to vulnerable shorelines in developing nations will be the most important adaptation strategies. Efficient water use will be vital to economic growth in the face of climate change, it said adding that the GDPs of India, China and Central Asia would be from 7 to 12% lower, and much of Africa would be about 6% lower by 2050 if water isn’t managed. “Countries that make water management a top national priority, backed up by major governance changes and investments, are more likely to adapt and prosper; those that do not will experience serious challenges,” the report said. The Commission has cited Ahmedabad’s heat action strategy as an example of adaptation Germany and India have both responded to devastating heat waves with action plans that focus on protecting their most vulnerable citizens it has said. “After a 2010 heat wave killed more than 1,300 people, Ahmedabad, India, took quick actions: training health care staff, distributing water, painting roofs with white reflective paint (to reduce the heat in homes by as much as 5°C), and more,” the report said leading to fewer than 20 people died in a similar heat wave in May 2015. “Climate change doesn’t respect borders: it’s an international problem that can only be solved with co-operation and collaboration, across borders and worldwide. It is becoming increasingly clear that in many parts of the world, our climate has already changed, and we need to adapt with it,” said Ban Ki-moon, 8th Secretary General of the United Nations and Chair of the Global Commission on Adaptation."
  
              
                   
" It’s just not cricket, but ever rising summer temperatures and extremes of rainfall are increasingly putting at risk India’s most loved sport of cricket, according to a new report by experts on climate change released at Lord’s on Monday. Combining climate science with heat physiology, the first-of-its-kind report on the global impact of climate change on cricket shows how batsmen and wicket-keepers are increasingly susceptible to poorer performances. Mike Tipton of the University of Portsmouth and the report’s co-author, says: “It’s the extremes of temperature that present the problems for cricket, particularly when combined with high levels of humidity that also appear to be on the rise”. “A batsman in full protective gear exercising during an Indian heatwave where relative humidity rises and the temperature exceeds 37°C will struggle to control body temperature; it’s just not possible to evaporate sweat at the rate required to control body temperature”. “Heat and humidity isn’t new to India, but for every degree the temperature rises, the harder it is for the body to regulate. If the extreme hot periods are lasting longer, there are questions as to whether we will see unplayable parts of the season, particularly towards the end of May.” The reports mentions recent instances in Indian venues when extreme heat affected play and attendance, as well as problems of water use during drought conditions. There has been a spike in recent years of ‘hot temperature days’ in New Delhi, Chennai and Jaipur. The Indian domestic cricket leagues run between August and May. It gets particularly hot towards the end of the season. The average maximum temperature for days in April and May has increased by 1-2°C since the 1970s, currently ranging from 40-42°C, the report notes. From extremes of rainfall, lack of rainfall or heat, the impact of climate change on India’s most loved sport is only set to increase, the report says. Tipton adds: “Above 35°C the body runs out of options to cool itself and for batsman and wicket-keepers even sweating has limited impact as the heavy protective cladding creates a highly humid micro-climate next to their bodies”. “It’s not the average temperature increase that climate change is bringing that is worrying, but the extremes of heat combined with high humidity. Particular care must be given to young players and the grassroots of the sport where elite-level cooling facilities simply aren’t available.” According to Kate Sambrook of the Priestley International Centre for Climate, “Scientific analysis shows specific droughts, heatwaves and storms made more likely by climate change are already impacting the game of cricket”. “The world is warming, but not equally meaning some spots including cricket playing nations India and Australia are seeing the mercury maximums reaching much higher than the average.” The MCC’s World Cricket Committee that includes Saurav Ganguly as its members was briefed on the report’s findings before the second Ashes Test at Lord’s in August. Its recommendations range from the need for cricketing authorities to follow the example of Cricket Australia in introducing specific heat rules to managing the political risk of cricket grounds competing for water in drought conditions."
" Degraded land spanning 26 million hectares (ha) in India will be restored by 2030, PM Narenda Modi announced at the 14th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (COP14 UNCCD) being hosted by India, taking up the target by five million from the current 21 million ha. About 96 million hectares, or 29.23%, of India’s land area is undergoing degradation, according to the Indian Space Research Organisation’s (Isro) land atlas 2016. Around 27% of the degraded land will be restored by 2030, according to the new target. “Going forward, India would be happy to propose initiatives for greater South-South cooperation in addressing issues of climate change, biodiversity and land degradation,” Modi said at the opening of the high-level segment of COP14, which will close on September 13. With many desertification-affected countries expecting India to share satellite-technology to track the implementation of land degradation control policies, Modi announced the setting set up a South-South Centre for Sustainable Land Restoration to share knowledge and training. “India would be happy to help other friendly countries develop land restoration strategies through cost effective satellite and space technology,” he added. The Prime Minister also repeated his promise of phasing out single use plastic starting October 2. “The menace of plastic waste has rendered large tracts of land unproductive and unfit for use. The way ahead is behaviour change,” he said. Immediately after COP 14, the UN will host the Climate Action Summit which will call on world leaders to take urgent action on climate change. “Agreements we reach here will be crucial in protecting and managing land,” said Ibrahim Thiaw, executive secretary, UNCCD. The convention, however, hasn’t mobilised the kind of funds needed to reverse desertification. “We need public and private funds. We are still far short of resources,” said Thiaw. Of the 196 countries that are parties to the UNCCD, 122, including India, have agreed to become land degradation neutral by 2030, as specified in Goal 15.3 of the sustainable targets on how much degraded land will be restored. Environment minister and COP14 president Prakash Javadekar said the New Delhi draft declaration is almost ready and will feature commitments by ministers from parties to the UNCCD on what they will do to curb and reverse desertification. It will also capture significant issues such as drought-led migration, land tenure and gender equity. He did not, however, specify how much of the 26 million ha to be restored will be forest land and how much will be agricultural land. India is on track to achieve its nationally determined contribution under the 2015 Paris Agreement, Modi said. “It would make you happy that India has been able to increase its tree cover. Between 2015 and 2017, India’s tree and forest cover has increased by 0.8 million hectares,” he said. Sunita Narain, head of Centre for Science and Environment, said of the increased target: “It’s a very laudable goal. I believe the government will now put forward an action plan on the issue of restoring our natural resources and on the issue of livelihoods of very poor people.” Modi also called upon the UNCCD to conceive a global water action agenda which will be central to the land degradation neutrality strategy. “When we address degraded lands, we also address water scarcity. Augmenting water supply, enhancing water recharge, slowing down water run-off and retaining moisture in the soil are all parts of a holistic land and water strategy”, he said. India had announced a campaign for water conservation and water security, the Jal Shakti Abhiyan, in July. The campaign will run with citizen participation during the monsoon season, from July 1, 2019, to September 15, 2019. An additional Phase 2 of the project will be run from October 1, 2019, to November 30, 2019, for states receiving the North-East retreating monsoons. India also has a Jal Shakti ministry dealing solely with drinking water and other water related issues."
        
       
                  
        
        
        
" Extreme weather events may have a negative impact on the mental well-being of people. Those whose homes are damaged by storms or floods are significantly more likely to experience mental health issues such as depression and anxiety, suggests a study. The study published in the journal ‘International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health’ found that people with weather-damaged homes are more likely to experience poor mental health even when the damage is relatively minor and does not force them to leave their homes. The researchers analysed data from a large national mental health survey called the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS). Survey fieldwork took place throughout 2014 and included a question which asked participants if their home had been damaged by wind, rain, snow or flood in the six months prior to the interview - this period included December 2013 to March 2014, which saw severe winter storms and extensive flooding in the United Kingdom. Taking other factors known to increase the risk of poor mental health into accounts - such as social disadvantage, debt, and poor physical health - the researchers found that people who had experienced storm and flood damage to their homes were about 50 per cent more likely to experience poorer mental health. “This study shows that exposure to extreme or even moderate weather events may result in ‘psychological casualties’ with significant impacts on mental health,” said study’s lead author Hilary Graham from the Department of Health Sciences at the University of York. “This is reflective of the huge impact storms and flooding have on people’s lives alongside the physical damage to homes and businesses, there is the emotional damage to the sense of security that many people derive from their home,” Graham added. The number of properties in the UK exposed to at least a one in 75-year flood risk is predicted to increase by 41 per cent under a 2-degree celsius temperature rise and by 98 per cent under 4-degree celsius temperature rise. “With extreme weather events on the rise due to climate change, environmental and health policies need to be brought much more closely together. This means recognising that flood protection policies are also health protection policies and that better protecting community from floods is also an investment in protecting their mental health,” said Graham. “The impact of flooding on people is devastating and can last long after the floodwaters have gone away. People can be out of their homes for months or even years, and the impacts are even wider if businesses, schools, and transport routes are affected. This research highlights how the consequences of flooding can have a significant impact on mental health wellbeing,” said Julie Foley, Director of Flood Risk Strategy & National Adaptation at the Environment Agency.

" While the greenback remains a common link between countries today, there’s another common, and not so pleasant link that’s bringing nations together – global warming. From Leonardo Di Caprio’s efforts to prevent catastrophic climate change to France encouraging people to swim during the scorching summer, and India making a proactive, environmental-friendly commitment at the Paris Climate Summit, global warming is no longer a threat – it is a stark reality that demands immediate attention. At a macro level, countries are slowly but surely implementing policies that curb use of hazardous materials across industries, which have an adverse effect on our environment. Further, at an individual level, only a handful of ‘aware and conscious’ citizens are taking steps to ensure they lead an environmentally friendly life. However, there is a vast degree of separation between government efforts and individual ambitions. Innova Engineering & Fabrication was born out of this realization. It aims to leverage waste generated by individuals and convert it into useful formulations for government institutions. This young firm led by an experienced team of professionals who understand the nuances of waste management is making strides through its novel idea of ‘converting plastic into re-usable alternate fuel.’ The basic premise of Innova is to produce alternate fuels, with characteristics similar to that of diesel via a patent-pending “Catalytic Thermal Decomposition Technology,” which churns all types of plastic and rubber waste into fuel that serves multiple purposes. “We are confident of making a positive impact, given that our firm was built on the principle of making the Earth a healthier place to live. Beyond the technology and revenue, there must be a ‘human’ element given our nature of business. We just don’t want to reduce waste by ‘x’%; instead, we want to revive the planet’s eco-system and motivate each person to become environmentally friendly, in the process,” shares Manojj Natarrajan, Director, Innova Engineering & Fabrication, when we inquired about his firm, Innova’s philosophy. To get a glimpse of the potential that such an idea possesses, let’s consider the following analysis. According to estimates, a whopping 9.2 MMT plastic waste is prevalent in India. Let’s assume, roughly 30% of this is converted by firms such as Innova, which means that they can make approximately 2.76 MMT fuel at 10,000 Kcal/Kg which results in to 33,000 GWatt worth of heat energy from this waste alone. Such huge amounts of energy can surely be distributed to a multitude of institutions that are looking at conserving the environment. With Prime Minister Modi announcing a nationwide ban on ‘single-use plastic’ starting on Gandhi Jayanti, let’s hope that this time around, the 2nd of October marks a new chapter in our pursuit towards restoring our planet’s ecological footprint.

" From rescuing protected marine species to curbing juvenile fishing, one Mumbaiite has reached out to thousands of fisherfolk along the Maharashtra coast, spreading the message of sustainable fishing practices. Ganesh B Nakhawa, 31, a member of the Karanja Fishing Cooperative Society in Mumbai Has been working to highlight key challenges such as the effects of climate change on fishing practices, plastic and industrial pollution, industrial fishing from foreign fishing fleets, sustainability in acquiring seafood, and marine wildlife conservation across districts along the Konkan coast. “From a very young age, the passion for the sea and specifically fishing drove to me to ensure I give something back to nature,” he said. Nakhawa is part of a seven-generation-old traditional fisher family, and began fishing at the age of 12. After finishing his higher education in Edinburgh, Scotland and garnering a degree in finance, Nakhawa chose not to pursue a future abroad. “I had a job offer from an investment bank, but I decided to come back to India in 2011 to pursue fishing as my primary career,” he said. Most recently, Nakhawa, along with a team of fishermen, spotted and traced a fleet of 10 large Chinese fishing vessels with over 200 crew members along the Ratnagiri coast, and informed state and Central authorities about their illegal fishing practices. The 10 vessels were detained in June by several departments of the Central government. A full-fledged investigation is still underway to understand what business these vessels had in Indian coastal waters. Chairman of the Maharashtra Purse Seine Fishing Welfare Association, an angling body focusing on reducing juvenile overfishing, Nakhawa and his team have been spreading awareness about 40 protected marine species found along the Maharashtra coast among resident fishing boat skippers and their crew. The association has managed to successfully rescue five whale sharks over the past year, among 20 other marine rescues, and has been informing the state about locations where dolphins, whales, tortoises, etc. are regularly spotted. “The idea is to develop more protected marine areas to enhance security for this ecosystem to thrive,” said Nakhawa. According to the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), Maharashtra’s marine fish landings fell by 22.5% in 2018 from 2017, due to high juvenile over-fishing and extreme weather events. Nakhawa recently filed complaints with the fisheries department, highlighting the sale of juvenile mackerel and pomphret at Mumbai’s docks. “Simpler uniform policies; encouraging the use of more sustainable fishing gear; reducing bottom trawling, and bringing regulations to the fish meal industry are the major solutions to deal with this alarming issue,” he said. “We need to become responsible consumers and refuse to purchase juveniles at markets.” CMFRI estimated that the juvenile fish catch across Maharashtra was leading to overall losses exceeding ₹686 crore per year, with 50% of the total catch from Mumbai. “There is a need to promote sustainable fishing now more than ever. While people like Nakhawa are trying to raise awareness in Maharashtra, similar efforts are being made across other states, from within the community,” said Akhilesh CV, scientist from CMFRI, Mumbai. N Vasudevan, additional principal chief conservator of forest, state mangrove cell, said, “Change from existing fishing practices requires a lot of effort for overall protection of our coastal ecosystem. In the short run, it may also involve loss of income. However, Nakhawa and his group are taking this message home to the main stakeholders much better than the government can do.”"
                           
      
                                     
                       
                          
              
" Students at a South Delhi Municipal Corporation school were in for a pleasant surprise on Tuesday when they got to play carrom with union minister Prakash Javadekar. The minister of environment, forest and climate change and information and broadcasting was at Nigam Pratibha Vidyalaya Kanya in Malviya Nagar to inaugurate “Safe Playroom”, an initiative to provide students with educational toys. Toy Bank, a Delhi-based organisation, collects toys through collection drives in private schools of Delhi. Each toy is refurbished and repackaged to create toy libraries across India. “An initiative like this also promotes a spirit of giving among people. It is a good move to ensure that age-appropriate toys are recycled and reach all children. The government too has created a scheme under Samagra Shiksha to provide over 10 lakh government schools with a ₹5,000-₹20,000 grant for sports equipment every year,”Javadekar said. A brainchild of Vidyun Goel, director of Toybanks, the playrooms are currently present in two south corporation schools in Delhi. “A child’s right to play is completely ignored in our society. So, the idea behind the playrooms is to provide educational and leisure toys to children to improve their learning skills,” she said. “We plan to expand to over 100 schools in a year. Through these safe playrooms, we aim to provide ample time and space for children to play freely. ” Goel said that an indoor play with different kinds of toys including board games, musical toys, storybooks, puzzles, building blocks, and soft toys would contribute towards the development of language, numeracy, environmental and life skills in children. “In every school, students from all sections and classes will get to visit the playroom once a week and play with age-appropriate toys,” she said. “We also ensure gender-neutral playrooms. Toys should not be gender-oriented as they help in the cognitive and social development of the child. In our playroom, boys play with kitchen sets,” she said."
" Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday highlighted India’s large scale efforts towards eliminating single use plastic, conserving water, harnessing solar energy and, protecting flora and fauna for a sustainable future in his address to a G7 session on environment here. Modi is attending the G7 Summit in this French town of Biarritz on special invitation of French President Emmanuel Macron. Prime Minister Modi said he addressed the session where he highlighted India’s large scale efforts towards eliminating single use plastic, conserving water, harnessing solar energy and, protecting flora and fauna for a sustainable future. “Reiterating India’s commitment to tackle global challenges PM @narendramodi attended the dedicated session of #G7Biarritz summit on ‘Biodiversity, Oceans, Climate’. Underlined India’s contribution to address reducing biodiversity, climate change, water stress & ocean pollution,” Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar tweeted. In his address to the Indian community at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris last week, Modi said India will achieve most of the COP 21 climate change goals set for 2030 in the next one and half years. The 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP21) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held in Paris from November 30 to December 12 2015 that saw the participation of 195 nations. The nations negotiated and adopted the Paris Agreement in which India made four commitments, including reducing greenhouse gas emission intensity of its GDP by 33-35 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, under its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC). It also pledged that 40 per cent of India’s power capacity would be based on non-fossil fuel sources and that the country will create an additional ‘carbon sink’ of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. The country had decided to better adapt to climate change by enhancing investments in development programmes in sectors vulnerable to climate change, particularly agriculture, water resources, Himalayan region, coastal regions, health and disaster management."
    
" In a boost to India’s bid to protect endangered animal species, the United Nations Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in Geneva on Monday banned illegal international trade of Indian star tortoise, smooth-coated otters and Asian small-clawed otters. These proposals had been put forth by India in December 2018 for consideration at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (CoP18) to the convention. The plan received a majority acceptance from world leaders. Apart from the ban on commercial trade for some species, Tokay gecko and 18 shark species were upgraded to a higher protection level. “It has been a remarkable success for us with almost all of our proposals receiving consensus from member states,” said MS Negi, additional director general of forest (wildlife), Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC), who was present at the conference. The Indian star tortoise was upgraded to CITES Appendix I (threatened with extinction) by full consensus among all member states (of CoP18 with 183 countries), giving it the highest level of international protection from commercial trade. “This is a landslide win for this species. India’s admirable efforts to protect a national treasure have been fully backed by all other range states,” said Dr Neil D’Cruze, head (wildlife research), World Animal Protection, who helped draft the proposal for India. Aniruddha Mookerjee, consultant wildlife advisor, WildCRU, University of Oxford, who co-drafted the proposal, said he welcomed the CITES decision. “Growing demand for star tortoises from the international illegal pet trade is so strong that more than 200,000 tortoises are estimated to be smuggled out of India and Sri Lanka annually,” he said. HT reported in detail about the need to protect star tortoises in July, increasingly being smuggled out of the country. “The species is known to be widely trafficked, particularly within Asia, and the Appendix I listing should spur further enforcement efforts,” said Saket Badola, head, TRAFFIC India, a wildlife trade monitoring group. Meanwhile, the global wildlife conference voted to ban international trade in smooth-coated and Asian small-clawed otters, both found in large numbers across India, especially along the Konkan coast. For smooth-coated otters, 102 member states voted in favour of up-listing their status to Appendix I, 15 were against it while 11 abstained. Another 98 member states voted for enhanced protection of Asian small-clawed otters, 16 were against it and 14 abstained. Proposals for these species were by India, Philippines and Nepal. “An Appendix I listing will benefit otter species by sending necessary market signals, including to online and social media audiences, that trade (for their fur pelts) in them is detrimental to their welfare and survival,” said Sumanth Bindumadhav, wildlife campaign manager at Humane Society International (HIS) India. The Tokay gecko (Gekko gecko) was included for the first time under Appendix II. The gecko is used in Chinese traditional medicine and traded throughout south-east Asia in dried form or preserved in alcohol. Additionally, 18 shark species (see box) – Guitarfish, Wedgefish and Mako Shars, all found along the Indian coastline, were given increased protection from illegal shark fin trade as proposed by 34 countries. The Maharashtra government welcomed international protection provided to star tortoise and otter species."
" At least 100 people have died in floods in three states in peninsular India — Kerala, Karnataka, and Maharashtra — in August due to monsoon floods. There are several reasons, as reported in a series of articles in Hindustan Times, for the havoc and deaths, such as changes in land-use patterns, excessive quarrying and unscientific plantations (Kerala), poor management of dams (Maharashtra), and lack of eco-sensitivity on the part of all the Western Ghat states. These existing issues have been aggravated because of one common factor — excessive rainfall during a short period, a telltale sign of climate change — leading to death and destruction. A similar scenario has also unfolded in the northern states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. The disaster in the Western Ghat region is a reminder that the area is very vulnerable, and utmost care must be taken to ensure that the delicate balance between nature and development is not disturbed. For example, reports from Kerala have said that excessive quarrying and wrongly constructed pits for monocultures resulted in landslides. There has been enough warning of such disasters. In 2011, the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel, also known the Madhav Gadgil Committee, had asked for a ban on mining and quarrying in the eco-sensitive zone. But the Gadgil report was criticised as biased against development, the government constituted another committee, the high-level working group or the Kasturirangan committee, which recommended a reduced zone of protection."
" The Amazon Rainforest is on fire, and we are all deeply disturbed. This horrific catastrophe holds a few lessons for us in India. Our most precious environmental hotspots can become everyone’s business. If Indians are torn up over Brazil’s environmental catastrophe, then the rest of the world can be expected to be-mourn our big environmental losses. If we accept sympathy from world leaders for natural disasters, we can also expect to hear their shock if the best of our forests, grasslands or wetlands are harmed. In short, in the age of climate change, such treasures are no longer ours alone. The world collectively needs them to survive. India has to be mindful of a changing world that will comment on what we’ve understood as sovereign issues till now. Secondly, we are also an impacted party. Just because Brazil is far away doesn’t mean the pollution won’t reach us. Particulate matter from China have hit Los Angeles and persistent pollutants have been found in Innuits of the Arctic-adrift from the nether regions of North America. Also, the lost forest means less carbon will be absorbed, leaving all of us more vulnerable to the climate crisis."
" To break the dominant narrative surrounding Jamia Nagar, five aspiring women artists will be displaying their artwork on identity, body politics, and media in the narrow bylanes of Ghaffar Manzil till the end of this month. Curated by Delhi-based artist Rabab Zaidi, the exhibition Green Shoots in the Neighbourhood aims to “create windows in the walls of the ghetto” and allow marginalised communities to express their voices through art. “This is also an effort to change the perception of the neighbourhood,” Zaidi, who turned her childhood home in Jamia into the Centre for Art and Free Expression (CAFE) two years ago, said. The centre is hosting the exhibition. CAFE aims to become a cultural centre that draws Muslims and other marginalised artists to freely express their talents. The artists are Kulsoom Khan and Kauser Jahan—who are studying at Faculty of Fine Arts in Jamia Millia Islamia—and Sitara Khan, Reshma Khatoon, and Tehmeena Firdos, who are its alumnae. On Saturday, the first day of the exhibition, the artists talked about their work to a motley group of people, including eminent artist Kanchan Chander. “Unlike other exhibitions, no one interrupted or confined us here to certain topics. It was our call. Besides, the intersectionality drew us to the place. There is no other space in Jamia for free creative expression, especially for Muslim women,” Jahan, a postgraduate student, said. Her work revolves around digital identities and media. Talking about her exhibit, titled Ignorance, which has two aluminium ears chained to each other, Jahan said, “There is a difference between listening and hearing. Be it climate change or atrocities against minorities, we hear about things happening around us but many choose to remain ignorant. My work depicts that.” “It helps to hold such exhibitions in areas such as Jamia Nagar since they create awareness among the community about arts and culture. The fine arts often don’t find a mention in career counselling sessions. The locality might warm up to the idea of their children pursuing arts,” she said. Reshma Khatoon, who hails from West Bengal and graduated last year from Jamia, said her work mostly revolves around how she sees women back home struggling to pursue their talents. “Even the higher education of women there is linked to getting better marriage proposals. Women are usually not allowed to work after the wedding. Through my work, I want to throw light on that,” she said. One of her paintings shows a woman with several hands pushing the walls of the room where she is standing. “It takes a lot for women to push through and extend their boundaries,” she said, explaining the concept.

" Environmentalists have slammed the Maharashtra government’s efforts towards opening the state’s salt pans for development. They have warned that this could destroy Mumbai’s natural buffers against floods, making the suburbs most susceptible. The state will soon be able to make its own laws for the use and development of these areas, after it gave its consent to the Centre to put salt pans in the concurrent list in Schedule VII of the Constitution. Currently, all issues related to salt pans come under the Union commerce and industry ministry. The state’s move has come at a time when it also declared plans to set up an expert committee to identify the reason behind floods in the state. D Stalin, director, Vanashakti, a Mumbai based NGO working for environmental rights opined that the state government has not learned its lesson from the past, wherein the greed of builders had made Maharashtra more prone to floods. “Opening salt pan land for development will increase flooding in Mumbai and will drown the entire suburbs. It will also destroy the coastal wetlands,” he said. Debi Goenka from Conservation Action Trust, another NGO working for environmental causes, said the move will be disastrous for the city. “Currently, salt pan lands are protected under coastal regulation zone [CRZ] rules. The wetlands play an important role in securing the city from floods. If the government opens them for development, it will prove disastrous for the city as sea levels are already rising because of climate change and the last thing one wants is to destroy the city’s natural defence,” Goenka said. Maharashtra has nearly 13,000 acres of salt pan land, with 5,300 acres in Mumbai, followed by around 2,000 acres in Vasai and 2,000 acres in Palghar. Of the 5,300 acres in Mumbai, the city’s Development Plan (DP) 2034 allows for 1,781 acres to be developed. However, it is not yet clear if the state will open up the entire 1,781 acres for construction, as a part of it may come under environment regulations. The opening up of salt pan land has been a matter of debate for decades, as proponents say it will provide respite to the affordable realty sector. Environment activists, however, have been opposing any such move. According to the draft regional plan of Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) for 2016-36, salt pans are crucial to Mumbai’s ecology as they safeguard the city against floods. “Salt pans are critically important from the point of view of flood protection as they are shallow depressed areas holding seawater. Salt pans today face a serious threat from the construction lobby,” states the report."
      
" India will lose 10% of its economy by 2100 if nothing is done to address climate change, according to a study co-authored by researchers from the University of Cambridge and published by the National Bureau of Economic Study on Monday. The study that makes projection for the business as usual scenario and a scenario where the countries have come together to implement the Paris Agreement suggests that all countries – the rich, the poor, the hot, and the cold ones – will suffer economically by 2100 if nothing is done. United States, which has pulled out of the Paris Agreement, will lose 10.5% of its gross domestic product (GDP) by 2100, according to the study. GDP is the monetary measure of all the final goods and services produced, which provides an economic snapshot of the country. The study found that Canada, which some claimed will benefit from a rise in temperature, would also lose 13% of its income by 2100. However, with Paris Agreement in place, both the countries would lose only 2% of the GDP. Under the business as usual scenario, Japan and New Zealand will lose 105 of their income, Switzerland will lose 12%, Russia 9%, and UK 4% of its GDP. The global loss would amount to 7% if nothing is done, the research shows. The researchers believe it is not the absolute temperature recorded in a country, but the deviation from the historical norm that will determine the impact of climate change on the economy. “Whether cold snaps or heat waves, droughts, floods or natural disasters; all deviations of climate conditions from their historical norms have adverse economic effects. Without mitigation and adaptation policies, many countries are likely to experience sustained temperature increases relative to historical norms and suffer major income losses as a result. This holds for both rich and poor countries as well as hot and cold regions,” said Dr Kamiar Mohaddes, a co-author of the study from Cambridge’s Faculty of Economics in a release. A study published earlier this year suggested that global warming had increased the inequalities between countries, with the rich, colder countries benefitting from the rising temperatures and the tropical, poorer countries losing out. The experts, however, suggested that this was a very simplistic view of the temperature change that did not account for technological advancements."
          
  
               
            
          
                     
                   
         
         
       
  
             
    
          
" The climate crisis is damaging the ability of the land to sustain humanity, according to a landmark United Nations (UN) report that was released on August 8 in Geneva. Explaining the process, the report — Climate Change and Land: an IPCC special report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas houses in territorial ecosystems — said that land is heating up faster than the oceans. The average surface temperature is now 1.5C higher than in the late 19th century. This is affecting food security, as heat, drought, and changes in rainfall damage crops. The UN report will be a key scientific input into forthcoming climate and environment negotiations, such as the Conference of the Parties of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (COP14) in New Delhi in September, and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference (COP25) in Santiago, Chile, in December. The UN report also provides the solution to reverse the trend. Ending the degradation of land can play an important role in securing a liveable planet by cutting emissions, providing sustainable food and reducing poverty. The threat of land degradation is real for India. Nearly 30% of the country’s land is degraded. An analysis by TERI, a New Delhi-based think tank, suggests an economic loss of 2.5% of gross domestic product due to land degradation in the country. India had, in 2015, voluntarily committed to restore 13 million hectares of degraded and deforested land as part of its “Bonn Challenge” pledge. Apart from meeting the promises made at the global high table, India has to step up its fight against land degradation simply because we have many more mouths to feed."
              
" On the ground, climate change is hitting us where it counts: the stomach. Without drastic changes in our diets, farming techniques and how we use land we will not be able to win the battle against climate change, according to a UN report. PARIS REDLINE ALREADY BREACHED Average land temperature has already crossed the 1.5° Celsius redline mentioned in the Paris Agreement (although that was for global temperature, which is land and sea temperatures), according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) report on climate change and land. The 2016 Paris Agreement said it would “pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognising that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change”. Thursday’s report, however, suggested that land temperatures have already risen 1.53°C and global temperatures by 0.87 °C. 500 million people lived in areas that experienced desertification between the 1980s and 2000s. 30% of total food produced globally is lost or wasted (estimated). DRASTIC CHANGES: A PITCH FOR VEGETARIANISM The report sees plant-based diets as key to deal with climate change — and also recommends that everyone eat less meat, especially red meat. 33% of current emissions can be saved by reducing red meat consumption and better farming practice, scientists said. Shift in diet: If people change their diets, reducing red meat and increasing plant-based foods, the world can save as much as another 15% of current emissions by mid-century Better farming: Techniques like no-till agricultural and better targeted fertilizer application can reduce carbon pollution up to 18% of current emissions levels by 2050, the report said. INDIA VULNERABLE 29% of land in India undergoing desertification and land degradation in 2011-13. Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Delhi, Gujarat and Goa have more than 50% of land area undergoing desertification and land degradation. Kerala, Assam, Mizoram, Haryana, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Arunachal Pradesh have less than 10% land degradation. EXPENSIVE, SCARCER, LESS NUTRITIOUS The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report says climate change is already making food more expensive, scarcer and less nutritious. “The threat of climate change affecting people’s food on their dinner table is increasing,” Nasa climate scientist Cynthia Rosenzweig, a report co-author."
          
                
           
" On the ground, climate change is hitting us where it counts: the stomach — not to mention the forests, plants and animals. A new United Nations scientific report examines how global warming and land interact in a vicious cycle. Human caused climate change is dramatically degrading the land, while the way people use the land is making global warming worse. Thursday’s science laden report says the combination is already making food more expensive, scarcer and even less nutritious. “The cycle is accelerating,” said NASA climate scientist Cynthia Rosenzweig, a report co-author. “The threat of climate change affecting people’s food on their dinner table is increasing.” But if people change the way they eat, grow food and manage forests, it could help save the planet from a far warmer future, scientists said Earth’s land masses, which are only 30% of the globe, are warming twice as fast as the planet as a whole. While heat-trapping gases are causing problems in the atmosphere, the land has been less talked about as part of climate change. A special report, written by more than 100 scientists and unanimously approved by diplomats from nations around the world at a meeting in Geneva, proposed possible fixes and made more dire warnings. “The way we use land is both part of the problem and also part of the solution,” said Valerie Masson-Delmotte, a French climate scientist who co-chairs one of the panel’s working groups. “Sustainable land management can help secure a future that is comfortable.” The report said climate change already has worsened land degradation, caused deserts to grow, permafrost to thaw and made forests more vulnerable to drought, fire, pests and disease. That’s happened even as much of the globe has gotten greener because of extra carbon dioxide in the air. Climate change has also added to other forces that have reduced the number of species on Earth. “Climate change is really slamming the land,” said World Resources Institute researcher Kelly Levin, who wasn’t part of the study but praised it. And the future could be worse. “The stability of food supply is projected to decrease as the magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events that disrupt food chains increases,” the report said. In the worst case scenario, food security problems change from moderate to high risk with just a few more tenths of a degree of warming from now. They go from high to “very high” risk with just another 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius) of warming from now. Scientists had long thought one of the few benefits of higher levels of carbon dioxide, the major heat-trapping gas, was that it made plants grow more and the world greener, Rosenzweig said. But numerous studies show that the high levels of carbon dioxide reduce protein and nutrients in many crops. For example, high levels of carbon in the air in experiments show wheat has 6 to 13% less protein, 4 to 7% less zinc and 5 to 8% less iron, she said. But better farming practices — such as no till agricultural and better targeted fertilizer application — have the potential to fight global warming too, reducing carbon pollution up to 18% of current emissions levels by 2050, the report said. If people change their diets, reducing red meat and increasing plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables and seeds, the world can save as much as another 15% of current emissions by mid-century. It would also make people more healthy, Rosenzweig said. Reducing food waste can fight climate change even more. The report said that between 2010 and 2016 global food waste accounted for 8 to 10% of heat-trapping emissions. “Currently 25-30% of total food produced is lost or wasted,” the report said. Fixing that would free up millions of square miles of land. With just another 0.9 degrees of warming (0.5 degrees Celsius), which could happen in the next 10 to 30 years, the risk of unstable food supplies, wildfire damage, thawing permafrost and water shortages in dry areas “are projected to be high,” the report said. At another 1.8 degrees of warming from now (1 degree Celsius), which could happen in about 50 years, it said those risks “are projected to be very high.” Most scenarios predict the world’s tropical regions will have “unprecedented climatic conditions by the mid to late 20th century,” the report noted. Agriculture and forestry together account for about 23% of the heat-trapping gases that are warming the Earth, slightly less than from cars, trucks, boats and planes. Add in transporting food, energy costs, packaging and that grows to 37%, the report said. But the land is also a great carbon “sink,” which sucks heat-trapping gases out of the air. From about 2007 to 2016, agriculture and forestry every year put 5.7 billion tons (5.2 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide into the air, but pulled 12.3 billion tons (11.2 billion metric tons) of it out. “This additional gift from nature is limited. It’s not going to continue forever,” said study co-author Luis Verchot , a scientist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture in Colombia. “If we continue to degrade ecosystems, if we continue to convert natural ecosystems, we continue to deforest and we continued to destroy our soils, we’re going to lose this natural subsidy...” Overall land emissions are increasing, especially because of cutting down forests in the Amazon in places such as Brazil, Colombia and Peru, Verchot said. Stanford University environmental sciences chief Chris Field, who wasn’t part of the report, said the bottom line is “we ought to recognize that we have profound limits on the amount of land available and we have to be careful about how we utilize it.”"
            
     
  
" In the first five days of the month, Mumbai has already recorded 78.2% of its August average rainfall which is 585.2mm. From August 1 to August 5 (up to 8.30pm), the Santacruz weather station and official rain readings for the city recorded 458mm rain. Since Friday 8.30am to Monday 8.30pm, Mumbai recorded 401.5mm rain, which helped the city surpass its seasonal average. There are still 56 days left for the season to end. A whopping 204mm 24-hour rain between Saturday and Sunday was the second highest August rain since 2011. “Mumbai, Thane, and Navi Mumbai received moderate to heavy showers over the last 24 hours with more impact on Navi Mumbai and Thane. Several areas in south Konkan and central Maharashtra too, recorded heavy to very heavy rains,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, India Meteorological Department. He said over the next 24 hours, Mumbai will receive light to moderate intermittent showers. After two nights of continuous downpour, moderate rainfall was witnessed in the suburbs, while light rain was recorded in south Mumbai. The Santacruz weather observatory recorded 61.6mm rain between 8.30am Sunday and 8.30am Monday, of which close to 40mm rain was recorded overnight. However, heavy rain continued in Thane, as 76.6mm was recorded over the past 24 hours. Light showers were recorded in the city throughout Monday. Private weather forecasting agency Skymet said rain intensity will remain low till August 9. “Systems allowing heavy to very heavy rain over north Konkan, including Mumbai have weakened and shifted southwards over south Konkan region. Only light to moderate showers are now expected,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet."
" Climate change isn’t just real, you can see its effects in your own housing complex. As the rains lash Mumbai, it’s hard to ignore how the monsoon has changed. Instead of showers distributed across three or four months, we now have week-long bursts of downpour. And the city is simply not equipped to deal with such volumes of water. Flooding occurs in neighbourhoods that never faced the problem before. As cars bob about in waterlogged parking lots and compound walls disintegrate, private townships are experimenting with flood-control mechanisms and hiring a growing tribe of experts to keep the worst effects of the monsoon at bay. The challenges are considerable – all projects ultimately are part of the city’s infrastructure, its drainage systems, electricity grids and roadways. “New, upcoming townships are typically designed or planned in isolation and don’t completely factor in the lack of infrastructure,” says Deben Moza, executive director for project management services at Knight Frank India. “We need better maintenance systems all around.” AGAINST THE FLOW The best practices are those that work with existing systems to manage monsoon woes. In Chennai, Mahindra World City by Mahindra Lifespaces says they typically study local catchment areas and flooding levels. Using contour maps, they determine the depths of waterbodies and land levels. “Percolation pits are then planned accordingly, so that floodwater can be directed there if necessary,” says head of projects Deepak Suvarna. In Nagpur, Radha Madhav Developers’ 111-acre township Vrindavan has 40 pumps on standby. “An issue then is maintenance of the pumps, because you may only use them a couple of times a year and we have to ensure they will all be in working order when needed,” says chief executive officer Hardik Agrawal. COLLECTION POINTS Bengaluru’s Radiance Realty also keeps submersible pumps on site, and has collection tanks in its basements."
" The planet endured what may have been the hottest July in history, the World Meteorological Organization said on Thursday, just a week after a European heat wave shattered all-time records and also coming on the heels of the world’s warmest-ever June. The month’s first 29 days were marginally warmer or on par with July 2016, the previous hottest July when average temperatures over land and ocean were 0.87C (1.57F) above the 20th-century average, according to WMO and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data. “We have lived always through hot summers. But this is not the summer of our youth,” Antonio Guterres, the United Nations’ (U.N.) secretary-general, told reporters. The announcement came after the U.N.’s WMO found that the previous month was the warmest June on record globally. Scientists have linked the warming planet to man-made climate change, predicting a rise in temperatures of 1.5C (2.7F) between 2030 and 2052 if global warming continues apace. Emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are chiefly responsible for climate change, according to scientific consensus. Heat waves “consistent with what we expect from climate change” scorched Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, France and Britain with new national temperature records last week. The WMO said the month’s searing heat was all the more noteworthy given that the record temperatures of July 2016 were tied to the El Nino phenomenon which contributes to heat, and which was not a factor this year. Guterres said the record temperatures based on provisional data were a reminder of the need to “take action on climate change now”. The world’s top diplomat has been seeking support for a September summit at the United Nations dedicated to stoking political will to tackle the climate crisis. NOAA defines July’s global 20th century average for land and ocean surfaces at 15.8C (60.4F)."
" With almost two months to go for the monsoon to end, Mumbai surpassed the 2,000mm rainfall mark and has so far covered 91.4% of the season’s average rain. The Santacruz weather observatory, representative of Mumbai, has recorded 2,117.8mm rain from June 1 to Friday (August 2) 8.30pm. The season’s average rainfall, from June to September, in Mumbai is 2,317.1mm. Meanwhile, the weather bureau issued a ‘red alert’ [extremely heavy rain] warning for Sunday for Mumbai and for Saturday and Sunday for Thane and Palghar. “Active monsoon conditions are being witnessed along the west coast, with excess rainfall for all Konkan districts. Strong westerly winds moving from sea to land continues to keep the monsoon surge active,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy-director general, western region, India Meteorological Department (IMD). “With the formation of a well-marked low-pressure area over Bay of Bengal over the next 24 hours, the west coast is likely to receive intense heavy to very heavy showers between Saturday and Sunday,” he said. On Friday, continuous moderate to heavy showers were witnessed in the suburbs, while intermittent heavy spells were witnessed in south Mumbai through the day. Between 8.30am and 8.30pm, the suburbs recorded 81.5mm (heavy) rain, while south Mumbai recorded only 44.6mm (moderate). According to the weather department, 15.6mm to 64.4mm of rain is considered ‘moderate’, 64.5mm to 115.5mm ‘heavy’, 115.6mm to 204.4mm ‘very heavy’ and more than 204.5mm ‘extremely heavy’. The city and suburbs witnessed ‘moderate’ showers over the past 24 hours. The suburbs recorded 43.4mm, while south Mumbai recorded 21.2mm rain between 8.30am Thursday and 8.30am Friday with majority of the rainfall recorded overnight. Currently, the Mumbai suburbs have received an excess of 49% rainfall for the season, while a 20% excess has been recorded for south Mumbai. Mumbai recorded its wettest July since 1901 when the Santacruz weather station recorded 1,470.4mm rain on Wednesday. In the first two days of August, Mumbai has recorded 132.4mm rain. The average for the month of August is 585.2mm."
" Climate Giri Eco Club members of Ramjas School, RK Puram, took part in a protest at Jantar Mantar called ClimateGiri. The protest was organised by an NGO, Nineismine. This campaign drew inspiration from Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish Girl, climate-activist and Nobel Peace prize nominee. Thunberg drew attention towards deteriorating climatic conditions all over the world. Friday was chosen as the day of the campaign based on the event Fridays for Future. Students of the school presented a dance on Hawa Badlo, Soch Badlo and displayed posters on climate change. Several activities such as skits, dances and poem recitation motivated people to help combat the Climate Emergency. Students raised slogans such as “What do we want? Climate emergency “, ”When do we want it? Now, because there is no Earth B.” In the end there was a team building activity using a parachute which signified pulling the bad air cover away from the Mother Earth. It can only be possible if we work together. The event was a grand success and created awareness among the masses about the climate emergency. Conclave 2019 Kulachi Hansraj Model School, Ashok Vihar, hosted a three-day annual inter-school fiesta of competitions titled Conclave 2019. The environment fest had numerous competitions intended to create environmental sensitivity. The trophy of the day was bagged by Montfort School which competed with over 50 schools from Delhi, NCR. Students made impressive presentations at the IT event Edge and the co-curricular competitions. Principal Sneh Verma praised the participants and encouraged students to continue the good work and become change makers. Annual Talent Show “Hatred does not cease by hatred, but only by love; this is the eternal rule,” said the Buddha. This quote inspired St Margaret Sr Sec School, Prashant Vihar to organise an Annual Talent Show titled Buddha: Yug Pravartak. Students presented a musical role play on the life and teachings of Lord Buddha. St Margaret School aims to provide students not just academic knowledge but also moral values to ensure their holistic development. Students learnt the lessons of love, peace, honesty and kindness from the event. Managing director Naveen Goswami and principal Renu Jain graced the occasion. They enlightened students about the teachings of Lord Buddha in detail. The show was a great source of learning for all. Finally, certificates were awarded to meritorious students. Swarnprasthians Celebrate Their Birthday in A Unique Way The students of Swarnprastha Public School, Sonipat, pledged to celebrate birthdays in a new way: They would bring saplings to the school on the day. This pledge was inspired by teacher SP Singh and principal Rashmi Grover. Kanak Malik of Class 12 was the first student to plant two saplings on the campus on her birthday. Then Siddarth Dahiya planted two saplings in the presence of the principal who appreciated their efforts. Other students too promised to plant a tree on their birthdays. They do not want to be left behind in going green and preserving the environment. The principal asked the volunteers to take care of their plants till they become trees. Social Studies Exhibition Bharti Public School, Mayur Vihar, presented a Social Studies exhibition. Different topics were covered in this exhibition such as Physiographic divisions of India, Ancient History, Medieval Period, Monuments, Rainwater Harvesting, Disaster Management and How to Vote, among others. Students learnt about voting from an attractive EVM model."
" The Goa government will write to the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC) to designate low-lying coastal lands and mudflats ,known as “khazans,” as eco-sensitive zones, under the Coastal Zone Management Plan that is being drafted. “All khazans, aquaculture ponds and salt pans should be demarcated and categorised as eco-sensitive zones.” Goa’s minister for environment Nilesh Cabral said on Thursday, adding that the state’s directorate of environment will approach the ministry on the matter . The lands lying below sea level and protected from the sea by a network of dykes and tide gates have traditionally been used either as aquaculture ponds to breed fish and prawns in the monsoons or to plant rice during the winter growing season or to harvest salt in the summer. They are facing a threat from breaches in the dykes allowing ingress of sea water as well as from reclamation for tourism purposes. “We explained this issue to the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management, but they told us that we would have to approach the ministry of environment and forests,” Cabral told reporters. The Coastal Zone Management Plan is a mandatory requirement under the CRZ (Coastal Regulation Zone) notification with areas within 200 metres from the point of the highest water level during the yearly spring tide designated as eco-sensitive and earmarked as “no development” zones. Lands falling with 500 metres of the high tide line are earmarked as “regulated.” Environmentalists have expressed the fear that the High Tide Line is being deviously shown further seawards in order to protect structures that would otherwise be marked illegal. At an earlier public consultation, the environment minister was booed by environmental activists who disrupted the exercise, forcing him to leave the meeting. Goa is the last state yet to approve its Coastal Zone Management Plan under the CRZ notification 2011 which has been pending since 2014. An earlier draft plan placed before the government was rejected; the government told the NCSCM that the plan could not be finalised owing to discrepancies. Cabral also announced that the government would be using drone cameras to identify and mark sand dunes to ensure that the plan being drafted is as accurate as possible. In November 2017 the principal bench of the National Green Tribunal had directed the governments of all coastal states to “without further default and delay, submit Coastal Zone Management Plans to the {MoEF&CC} by April 30, 2018” and warned that “in the event any state government and union territory does not submit the plan, they shall be liable for exemplary costs of 5-lakh which should be recovered from the salary of the defaulting officer. The non compliance would invite action for violating the orders of the Tribunal.” That deadline has long since passed. This is the latest effort by the Goa government to draft the Coastal Zone Management Plan to protect the coastline from further erosion. Olencio Simoes, an environmental activist, said green activists only wanted an accurate plan that records all of Goa’s coastal features as well as the destruction that has been caused over the years."
       
          
" The month of July ended with a rainfall deficit of 30% in the district—the lowest in July in the last three years, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). In the same period last year, Gurugram had a deficit of 33%. In 2017, the deficit was much higher at 64%. However, despite the deficit being at a three-year low, experts said the shortage of rainfall, so far, is a concern for agriculture and water management, and that the deficiency is unlikely to be met in August. Gurugram received 155.05 mm rainfall in July against a normal of 221.5 mm. June, too, had ended with a deficit of 85% due to negligible pre-monsoon rainfall, making it the driest June in the past six years. According to the IMD data, the first 10-odd days since the arrival of monsoon on July 5 had received very little rainfall, and had led to a deficit of around 85%. However, the district received “good spells of rainfall” between July 15 and 20, and again between July 25 and 28, recovering the accumulated deficit by a large extent. As of July 28, Gurugram was short of the ‘normal’ amount of rainfall by 26%, data from the meteorological department shows. According to meteorologists, the El Nino weather pattern led to a drier weather for most of the month, and that threat had passed by late July, leading to better rainfall. “Intense rain for fewer days is a result of climate change. Rain patterns have been unusual in the recent years because of the same,” IMD direct general of meteorology KJ Ramesh said. The last time Gurugram received ‘normal’ rainfall in the month of July was in 2016, with 11% more rainfall than the normal. July is usually considered the rainiest month for the south-west monsoon. “Northwest parts of the country have, over the last three to four years, usually witnessed a rainfall deficiency. For the last few years, monsoon has remained concentrated around central India,” said Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist at Skymet, a private weather agency."
     
   
                        
                 
           
" It rained for a few days in the first week of of July and since then, not a drop has moistened the parched land of Kokdakhar, a village in Chhattisgarh’s Kabirdhan district, where farmers are bracing for their crops to fail for the second year in a row. The only resource that’s helping them tide over the crisis is a large earthen dam, 4.5m deep and 62m long, that the villagers toiled for months last summer to build. The dam, which captures the flow from ridge to valley, stores water and arrests erosion. It has harvested enough water since last summer for people to bathe, for cattle to drink and even to irrigate some of their small maize and millet farms. The Indian Institute of Science (IISc)’s mapping of blocks in Chhattisagrh have found Kawardha, the block of which Kodakhar is a part, to be one of the most vulnerable to rising temperatures and the vagaries of the monsoon. It is among 103 blocks in Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Bihar where the ministry of rural development (MoRD) is piloting a project to see how the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme (MGNREGS), which guarantees 100 days of manual work to at least one member of every rural household, can be used to make villages resilient to climate change that causes changes in the monsoon patterns, more dry days and flash floods. Tiharo Bai, who was among the 1,100 people who has built the dam, farm ponds and check dams under MGNREGS, said the assets had become life savers. “We got some money under the 100 days’ scheme when there was no work. We also got water to survive the drought. There are only three hand pumps, everything else has run dry,” said Tiharo Bai, who belongs to the Baiga tribe that lives in the remote village devoid of employment opportunities. Kawardha recorded a one degree temperature increase between 1984 and 2014, according to the IISc, and received only four years of normal sowing rains in the same 30-year period, indicating its vulnerability to climate change. Submersible pumps cannot be installed because the water table in the area is very low. The average work days per household increased during climate-proofing works from 56 in 2015-16, to 79 in 2018-19. Bharari village in Bilaspur district arrested the migration of its young people to cities after climate-proofing works of connecting a network of six large ponds was implemented in 2017. This otherwise dry region became prone to flash floods because of the construction of a power grid, which caused water logging. Tapping water and routing it through a channel to a pond, connected to a network of five other ponds, now stretches over 10.5 ha, storing it or irrigation, domestic use and fish farming. “I used to get 15 quintals of paddy before these ponds were connected; last year I got 26 quintals of paddy. People have stopped migrating because we are earning enough here,” said Jatan Lal, a village elder. Jhiriya, another Baiga village in Mungeli district, has managed to utilise natural spring water by routing it to farm ponds for fish farming. Digging her own pond helped Jonuha Jonhu getting a harvest of arhar lentils and about 25 kilos of rohu fish, which she sold last year. “There are demonstrable examples in the three project states of beneficiaries growing multiple crops and coping better with flood and/or droughts,” said Sriparna Sanyal Iyer, national team leader, Infrastructure for Climate Resilient Growth at IPE Global, an MoRD consultant implementing the project. Despite the documented benefits, ,the average days of employment per household in 2018-19 under MGNREGA was 56 in Chhattisgarh, and the average wage rate was Rs 163.99 per day. The minimum wage rate is Rs 230 per day for agriculture. Many women complained of payments getting delayed by months. “The person days are less than 100 because the scheme is not needed all the time. It’s only for times of distress. We plan to tie up with the environment ministry to get funds to expand the climate-proofing works under MGNREGS,” said a senior official of MoRD."
                      
" Germany was not my first choice. When the temperatures became unbearable in Delhi, we decided that it was finally time to take our annual summer vacation, something I had put off because of work pressures. Traditionally, we go West in the summer, because the climate is more temperate. This time, however, climate change had ensured that this was not so. Paris temperatures were nearly as high as the city’s hotel room rates (and a lot hotter than many places in India). Likewise with the nicer parts of Italy. Spain and Portugal were cheaper, but hot. Amsterdam was much too expensive. London in the summer is never a very attractive proposition; I love the city but summer is when you meet all the people you have spent all year avoiding in Delhi. So, by a process of elimination, we settled on Germany. Air India and Lufthansa both had direct flights to Frankfurt and the Air India fare was not too exorbitant. The problem was that while I had been to Frankfurt four times, I had no distinct memories of it at all. One trip had been for the launch of India: Then and Now at the book fair; another on my way to Stuttgart for a Mercedes symposium; a third on the way to wine country and the fourth and most recent, as a stopping-off point for Luxemburg. So my wife and I decided we would take the flight to Frankfurt because it was convenient, but we would then quickly get the hell out of there and go somewhere more scenic. We settled on Cologne (a two-hour drive away), largely because we had heard of it, though we knew nothing at all about the city. I have long been a member of Leaders Club, a programme run by The Leading Hotels of the World, a body of independent hoteliers and though the membership has many rewards (late check-out, upgrade to the next category of room, etc.) I have hardly used my membership in recent years, relying instead on Marriott’s superb Luxury Collection properties in Europe (The Gritti Palace in Venice, Hotel Alfonso XIII in Seville, Hotel Maria Cristina in San Sebastian etc.). But there were no Luxury Collection hotels in Cologne and the Leading Hotels property in Cologne, a family-owned grand hotel called Excelsior Hotel Ernst, seemed irresistible. So, knowing nothing about Cologne, very little about the hotel except that it was over a century old, and knowing even less about Germany, we booked our flights and set off. And am I glad we went? Gosh, yes! It was amazing! Though we had no way of knowing this when we booked, the Excelsior Hotel Ernst is right opposite Cologne Cathedral, one of the most inspiring and beautiful churches in Europe. Within minutes of checking in, we went off to the cathedral and were stunned by its sheer beauty and majesty. It is run by the Church, entry is free and they are hospitable and tolerant. Right in front of the entrance stood a group of Hare Krishnas, singing loudly and dancing. The priests were happy to let them sing and chant, and their tolerance extended to all religions and sects. The following day, the Falun Gong, a Chinese sect, actually set up a counter in the church’s compound and were regarded with the same benevolence. The old city of Cologne is smallish, charming and easy to walk around in. It is full of pedestrian streets, little cafés with outdoor seating, musicians who play for free (you can drop a few coins in their caps if you like) at street corners and it borders the Rhine, the river of legend. There were some foreign tourists (mainland Chinese, mainly) but the vast majority of visitors were Germans so there were few concessions to non-German speakers. Menus were in German, and at most restaurants, there were usually only one or two staff members who could speak in English. For all that, they were extraordinary friendly and helpful, far nicer than staff at establishments in France, the UK, or even Italy. They were genuinely welcoming and good-natured. Because we had arrived in Cologne with no expectations and no plans, we took each day as it came. By some coincidence, we had arrived in time for the Cologne Lichter, the most spectacular fireworks display I have ever seen. It is around 25 minutes of dazzling lights in the sky choreographed to a soundtrack of music. It lights up the Rhine while hundreds of thousands of people, who have come in from all over Germany, sing, dance and light their own sparklers on the banks of the river. Cologne is the home of Eau de Cologne, so I went off to Farina, the house that invented the scent and to 4711 (the brand that gave it mass popularity.) We took cruises on the Rhine. A short train journey (German trains are good: nearly as good as the Swiss) took us to Königswinter and up the mountains to the castle of Drachenfels.  The highlight, for us, was the Ludwig Museum, one of Germany’s greatest art museums, full of original Picassos, Klees, Fontanas, Mondrians and other masterpieces as well as a whole section devoted to pop art: Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, etc. None of this is to say that we went from museum to cathedral, one after the other. Most of the time, we just ambled aimlessly, stopping at traditional beer places for sausages and tarte flambé. Or we sat and lazed in town squares listening to musicians play. There was no need to dress up, no need to plan ahead and everywhere we went was cool and breezy. Frankfurt was supposed to be no more than a transit point but the two days we spent there were a revelation. It was bright and sunny, the flowers were in bloom and we ate every meal al fresco, enjoying the greenery as much as we enjoyed the food. Ah, the food. Well, let’s talk about the good first. I asked for restaurant recommendations on Twitter and the most credible suggestion came from my friend Maunika Gowardhan (@cookinacurry) who sent us to the lovely Villa Merton where we ate Michelin-star food in the garden of a villa as evening fell. Having admired the Rembrandts at the Stadel Museum, we repaired to the museum’s Holbein restaurant where we ate an excellent lunch on the terrace. Frankfurt has no three-Michelin star restaurants and only one two-star, which is fairly pathetic for a great metropolis. Cologne has two restaurants with two stars. We went to one of them Le Moissonier, a cramped French bistro where the owner and his wife looked after the room with warmth and care. But the tables were so small and so tightly packed that I could not understand why every side dish came in unnecessarily large plates, which the table could not easily accommodate. Most of the food was fine but hardly of two-star quality and one dish, the pâte de foie gras was dire: it had either been in the fridge too long or they had bought it from outside (a common enough practice). I can only assume that a French Michelin inspector was homesick when he gave the restaurant two stars. As for the rest of the food, Germans always complain that outsiders treat their food as comprising boiled meat, schnitzel, sausages and potatoes. Well, having eaten now at very many non-fancy places in Germany, I can tell you that, in actual fact, German cuisine is boiled meat, schnitzel, sausages and potatoes. Yes, every cliché is accurate.  Which is not to say it is bad. I like sausages and potatoes. But yes, there comes a time when you tire of bratwurst and long for something different. My experiment with the French bistro having misfired. I went Asian instead. I found an authentic Sichuan restaurant called Great Wall (it was cheap and two thirds of the guests were Chinese) and ordered tonnes of takeaway: Mapo Tofu, Gong Bao Chicken, Beans with Minced Pork, Sichuan Barbecued Pork etc. and smuggled it back to our room. Out of respect for the Excelsior Ernst’s deluxe surroundings, we drank good champagne with it. It is shameful to admit, but I don’t think I enjoyed a meal in Cologne as much as I enjoyed my takeaway! If all this makes Germany sound wonderful, well yes, it really was. Not everything is perfect. Frankfurt Airport is run in a manner reminiscent of those World War Two POW camp movies and my Frankfurt hotel was disappointing. But we had so much fun, found it was much cheaper than France or England (which was a surprise) and by the time we left, began to wonder why it had taken us so long to discover Germany.

" While the prevalence of undernourishment in India declined from 22.2% in 2004-06 to 14.5% between 2016 and 2018, an increase in the unemployment rate in India and decreasing economic growth in Pakistan between 2017 and 2018 led to a marked increase in food insecurity in southern Asia, according to The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report of the United Nations released on Monday. In absolute numbers, India’s undernourished population fell from 253.9 million in 2004-06 to 194.4 million in 2016-18, said the report. In Southern Asia, food insecurity increased from less than 11% in 2017 to more than 14% in 2018. “This possibly reflects an increase in the unemployment rate in India between 2017 and 2018, and especially in Pakistan, where growth is expected to slow down significantly,” said the report. In the Indian Himalayas, an economic slowdown coupled with natural resource depletion and climate change had a negative impact on food production and employment opportunities. This resulted in increased threats to food security due to lower purchasing power, the report said. At least 11% of the world’s population, or at least 820.6 million people, are undernourished, casting a shadow on the probability of achieving the zero hunger target by 2030 as part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Asia and Africa have 513.9 million and 256.1 million hungry people, respectively. Food insecurity is a secondary issue for India, which is struggling to curb malnutrition, experts said. “If you look at government data, less than 10% children are getting an acceptable diet. Only 54% children are being exclusively breastfed for six months. It seems difficult to attain the 27% stunting target by 2025 at the pace at which things are going. It’s projected at about 31%. There are bigger issues at hand,” says Dr Antaryami Dash, nutrition expert at the NGO Save The Children. The report shows that the decline in hunger the world had enjoyed for over a decade was at an end, and that hunger was again on the rise. About 2 billion people in the world experience moderate or severe food insecurity. The lack of regular access to nutritious and sufficient food that these people experience puts them at greater risk of malnutrition and poor health. After decades of steady decline, the trend in world hunger — as measured by the prevalence of undernourishment — reverted in 2015, remaining virtually unchanged in the past three years at a level slightly below 11%."
           
               
" Rains lashed parts of Delhi and the National Capital Region on late Monday afternoon, bringing to an end the long wait for monsoon showers and taking the temperature down a few notches to settle at 33 degrees. The relief from scorching heat falls in place with predictions by India Meteorological Department (IMD) that had indicated light showers starting for the Delhi-NCR region from Monday to Thursday. The region has had its share of cloud cover but the rains have eluded the area witnessing a dry spell for weeks now. “The sky will remain generally cloudy with light rain or drizzle expected. The city is likely to receive light rain till Thursday,” an India Meteorological Department (IMD) official said. The maximum and minimum temperature is expected to oscillate between 37 and 29 degrees Celsius, respectively. Private weather forecasting agency Skymet echoed the IMD, saying rain was expected to commence from Monday. “Winds over Delhi and NCR have changed to easterly. We expect the weather to change and rains will commence by today evening. Intensity will increase gradually,” Mahesh Palawat, Vice president Meteorology and Climate Change at the Skymet Weather said. Delhi to witness weak monsoon According to the Skymet, Delhi may receive below-normal rainfall this year, an official said, reported ANI. “The national capital may receive less than normal rainfall this year. The area may get light showers on July 15 and 16. Monsoon is likely to remain weak over Delhi, Punjab and Haryana,” Mahesh Palwat, Vice President, Meteorology and Climate Change, Skymet told ANI. According to Palwat, the monsoon that was to hit Delhi in early July has remained stagnant over Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. “The low-pressure system that developed over UP and Bihar has not yet moved towards Delhi,” he said. “The national capital will get rains only after the thrust that has remained concentrated over the Himalayan foothills of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, north UP and Bihar up to north-east India, comes southwards,” he added."
     
" Two reports in the British daily, The Guardian, over the last week or so have strengthened my conviction that climate change deniers like US President Trump should be ignored. Anyhow, I have never understood how, in the face of so much evidence to the contrary, climate change deniers are prepared to take the risk that they are wrong, and thereby be willing to expose the world to the possibility of a cataclysmic disaster. Surely that is a risk not worth taking. The reports have also confirmed my conviction that we need to broaden our concern about climate change beyond policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions levels. It’s not that they are unimportant. A recent survey conducted by King’s College London, suggests that eight year-old children living in the English city of Birmingham could have their lives shortened by seven months on average because of breathing toxic air. As usual it is the poor — those living, in the most deprived areas of the city — who are at the greatest risk. The first report I read comes from the United Nations where the Secretary General’s special representative on disaster risk reduction spoke to The Guardian. Mami Mizutori, has warned that climate change is very much with us already. According to her, climate related disasters occur weekly. We notice the major disasters, among which she lists the current drought here in India, but she says “lower impact events that are causing death, displacement and suffering are occurring much faster than predicted”. According to Mizutori, the emphasis so far has been on cutting green house gases. Now we need to concentrate also on mitigating their impact. This means building infrastructure such as housing, factories, roads and railways, electricity and water supply systems which are resilient to the effects of floods, droughts, storms, and extreme heat. Slum dwellers in Indian cities are particularly at risk from the hazards caused by climate change. Mizutori said, “nature based solutions such as mangrove swamps, forests and wetlands that could form, natural barriers to flooding should be a priority.” I also read a report on a study published in the journal Science. It stresses the urgent need to go beyond curbing emissions of greenhouse gases and take out the emissions which have already been pumped into the atmosphere. This study also suggests a natural solution, making use of a tree’s capability to absorb and store the gases causing global warming. The study is the work of a team led by Tom Crowther, a professor in environmental studies at Zurich university in Switzerland. The team has mapped the world to measure how many more trees could be planted without encroaching on land which carries crops or urban on areas. The area, the team reckons, is equivalent to the whole of Russia and China. Describing the results of his team’s mapping Crowther has said, “This new quantitative evaluation shows that forest restoration is not just one of our climate change solutions, it is overwhelmingly the top one” Who is to plant the trees and who is to pay for them? In the BBC radio programme, Science in Action, Crowther said, “All it requires is us humans on the ground getting involved ourselves either by restoring ecosystems ourselves or by giving money to people who are restoring ecosystems.” The two reports I read suggest practical measures which can be taken to provide protection from the impact of climate change and clean the air we breath. They both require governments to broaden their vision beyond the bickering over the amount of climate change producing gases they will allow each country to produce and concentrate on these and other long-term measures. To bring about that change will require popular pressure on politicians. As Crowther has said, “we the people need to get directly involved too.” In India we need to revive the Chipko Andolan movement on a country wide scale, and this time by planting new trees as well as defending existing ones."
" The Supreme Court Friday declined to stay a National Green Tribunal (NGT) order declaring a 52- acre plot in Sarai Khwaja village of Haryana’s Faridabad a “deemed forest,” saying the matter needs to be heard in greater detail. The Haryana government appealed to the Supreme Court against the NGT order, which effectively meant that construction cannot take place in the village. The government had, prior to the NGT order, already issued permission to builders to carry our construction on the plot. A bench comprising justice Rohinton Nariman and justice Surya Kant issued notices to the respondent in this case and petitioner in the NGT, Lt Col (Retd) Sarvadaman Singh, and to the environment ministry on Friday. “The bench refused to the stay the NGT order. So the NGT order is in place and the plot should be considered a forest for now. Col Singh has been asked to file a reply to Haryana’s appeal in SC,” said Ritwick Dutta, who represents Singh in SC. The order is yet to be published. Haryana’s additional advocate general, Anil Grover, who is representing the state, said: “The bench said the matter requires detailed consideration.” The licences issued to the builders would not be revoked, he added. Three months after the NGT held the 52-acre plot in the Faridabad Aravallis, where more than 7,000 trees were felled in 2017 for a housing project, was a “deemed forest,” the Haryana government moved the SC, saying the NGT order was “erroneous in law.” The plea raised questions of law, whether any land can be declared a deemed forest despite a different stand taken by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, which is in the process of finalising the definition of a forest; and whether the enquiry report the NGT considered to deliver its ruling was “illegal, vitiated and liable” to be rejected, among others. One of the main contentions of the plea filed in NGT in June 2017 was that the Haryana government had been in violation of the Supreme Court orders in the TN Godavarman and Lafarge cases pertaining to forest issues in 1996 and 2011, respectively. Those judgments said irrespective of whether an area is a forest as per revenue records, it will be covered by the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and cannot be used for any non-forestry activity without the Centre’s permission."
" Former vice president and the Democratic Party frontrunner in the 2020 presidential campaign Joe Biden said the US needs to reach out to India and other partners in Asia to “fortify” its collective capabilities while strengthening cooperation with “friends” beyond Europe. Laying out his foreign policy vision for America, Biden said he will focus to restore dignified leadership at home and respected leadership on the world stage. Arguing that America’s policies at home and abroad are deeply connected, 76-year-old Biden said that if elected, he will advance the security, prosperity, and values of the United States by taking immediate steps to renew its own democracy and alliances, protect its economic future, and once more place America at the head of the table, leading the world to address the most urgent global challenges. “We need to look for opportunities to strengthen domestic cooperation with friends beyond North America and Europe, reaching to our partners in Asia, including Japan, South Korea, Australia, India to fortify our collective capabilities,” Biden said in a speech at The Graduate Center at The City University of New York here Thursday. He said during his first year in office, he will organise and host a global Summit for Democracy to renew the spirit and shared purpose of the nations of the Free World. He said he will bring together the world’s democracies to strengthen the democratic institutions, honestly confront the challenge of nations that are backsliding, and forge a common agenda to address threats to our common values. The Summit would prioritise results by galvanising significant new country commitments in the areas of fighting corruption, defending against authoritarianism, including election security and advancing human rights in their own nations and abroad. In a Biden administration, America will lead by example and rally the world to meet the common challenges that no one nation can face on its own, including climate change, nuclear proliferation, great power aggression, transnational terrorism, cyberwarfare and mass migration. Biden also strongly criticised President Donald Trump’s erratic policies, saying failure to uphold basic democratic principles have surrendered America’s position in the world, undermined its democratic alliances, weakened its ability to mobilise others to meet these challenges, and threatened its security and future. “The world sees [President Donald] Trump for what he is: insincere, ill-informed, and impulsive. Sometimes corrupt. Dangerously incompetent, and incapable, in my view, of world leadership and leadership at home,” Biden said. “The threat that I believe President Trump poses to our national security and where we are as a country is extreme,” Biden said, adding that Trump’s “chest-thumping”, erratic policies and failure to uphold basic democratic principles have “muddled our reputation and our place in the world.” Biden also made a scathing attack on how Trump is dealing with China, saying Beijing was “playing the long game.” “We need to get tough with China,” he said. “The most effective way that we need to change is to build a united front of friends and partners to challenge China’s abusive behaviour, even as we seek to deepen cooperation on issues where our interests are converged like climate change and preventing nuclear proliferation,” he said. Biden’s campaign said that he strongly believes economic security is national security and that is why, as president, Biden will pursue a foreign policy for the middle class. He said to win the competition for the future against China or anyone else, America must sharpen its innovative edge and unite the economic might of democracies around the world to counter abusive economic practices. The campaign also added that as president, Biden will end the “forever wars” in Afghanistan and the Middle East, which have cost the country untold blood and treasure. He would bring the vast majority of American troops home from Afghanistan and narrowly focus the US mission on Al-Qaeda and ISIS. Biden also slammed Trump for his relationship with authoritarian leaders like Kim Jong-un of North Korea, saying “we do not coddle dictators.” He said Trump “undermines our Democratic alliances while embracing dictators who appeal to his vanity… Make no mistake about it — the world sees Trump for what he is: insincere, ill-informed and impulsive.” In North Korea, Biden said as president, he will empower American negotiators and jump start a sustained, coordinated campaign with its allies and others, including China, to advance the shared objective of a denuclearized North Korea. On Iran, he said the historic Iran nuclear deal, negotiated by the Obama-Biden administration alongside American allies and other world powers, blocked Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Yet Trump decided to cast it aside, prompting Iran to restart its nuclear program and become more provocative, bringing the region to the cusp of another disastrous war. He said if Tehran returns to compliance with the deal, as president he would re-enter the agreement, using hard-nosed diplomacy and support from America’s allies to strengthen and extend it, while more effectively pushing back against Iran’s other destabilizing activities. He stressed that “American leadership is not infallible — we’ve made missteps and mistakes. But let me be clear — I will never hesitate to protect the American people.”"
" Private weather forecasting agency Skymet on Tuesday said a break in monsoon conditions is expected from Wednesday in Mumbai. “Over the next 24 hours, rainfall over Mumbai is expected to reduce significantly. There will also be a reduction in monsoon over interiors of Maharashtra including Vidarbha and Marathwada. However, south Konkan will continue to receive moderate showers. Active monsoon conditions are expected to revive from July 17,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet. Meanwhile, the city witnessed partly cloudy conditions, irregular intervals of sunshine and intermittent light showers throughout the day on Tuesday. From 8.30am to 5.30pm, south Mumbai recorded 7.6mm rain, while the suburbs recorded 2.2mm, both falling under the light category. From 6pm onwards, many areas in the suburbs and south Mumbai recorded intermittent moderate showers. Mumbai has so far received 85% of its July average rain and almost 60% of its seasonal average till Tuesday. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Monday had predicted that Mumbai would record up to 200mm rain on Tuesday. The same warning was reiterated by Mumbai police commissioner Sanjay Barve in his tweet requesting citizens to stay safe."
                
    
         
" Cranes hoist cargo onto the deck, power tools scream out and workers bustle through the maze of passageways inside the German icebreaker RV Polarstern, preparations for a year-long voyage that organisers say is unprecedented in scale and ambition. In a couple of months, the hulking ship will set out for the Arctic packed with supplies and scientific equipment for a mission to explore the planet’s frigid far north. The icebreaker will be the base for scientists from 17 nations studying the impact of climate change on the Arctic and how it could affect the rest of the world. “So far we have always been locked out of that region and we lack even the basic observations of the climate processes in the central Arctic from winter,” said Markus Rex of Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute, who will lead the 140-million euro ($158 million) expedition. “We are going to change that for the first time,” Rex told The Associated Press in an interview on Wednesday aboard the Polarstern at its dock in Bremerhaven, Germany. Scientists plan to sail the ship into the Arctic Ocean, anchor it to a large piece of sea ice and allow the water to freeze around them, effectively trapping themselves in the vast sheet of white that forms over the North Pole each winter. As temperatures drop and the days get shorter, they’ll race against time to build temporary winter research camps on the ice, allowing them to perform tests that wouldn’t be possible at other times of the year or by satellite sensing. “We can do a lot with robotics and other things but in the end the visual, the manual observation and also the measurement, that’s still what we need,” Marcel Nicolaus, a German sea ice physicist who will be part of the international mission, said. “We need to go out, establish that ice camp.” Dozens of scientists from the United States, China, Russia and other countries will be on board the Polarstern at any one time, rotating every two months as other icebreakers bring fresh supplies and a new batch of eager researchers. The mission is considered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for many scientists, even those who are veterans of multiple Arctic expeditions. It is receiving substantial funding from US institutions such as the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Nasa. By combining measurements on the ice with data collected from satellites, scientists hope to improve the increasingly sophisticated computer models they use to predict weather and climate. The interdisciplinary work spans several fields of science, including physics, chemistry and biology. Its overarching purpose -- to answer key questions around global warming -- means there’s no time for national rivalry, said Rex. “The different geopolitical interests don’t play a role in our research community,” he said. The mission’s international collaboration and scope have drawn comparisons with the International Space Station, the most expensive and remote outpost mankind has yet created. “Actually, we’ll be farther away from civilisation because the space station is in an orbit only 400 to 500 kilometers high,” Rex said. Once the Polarstern is carried into the depth of the Arctic night, far off the coast of northern Greenland, the scientists will be on their own, making any emergency evacuation almost impossible. “We’ll be isolated,” Rex said. “No other icebreaker can then reach us because the ice will be too thick.” While the ship has a fully equipped medical station, the aim is to avoid any calamity on board, said Verena Mohaupt, a logistics expert who has spent months preparing safety measures for the mission. This includes creating a perimeter fence on the ice that will sound a loud alarm if a polar bear approaches. “We’re going to have to experiment and hope it works,” said Mohaupt. The MOSAiC mission, which stands for Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate, comes about 125 years after Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen first managed to seal his wooden expedition ship, Fram, into the ice during a three-year expedition to the North Pole. Since then, scientific understanding of the role the Arctic plays in the world’s climate has grown, though so has concern about the changes being observed, such as increasingly early sea ice melts . Scientists now believe the cold cap that forms each year is key to regulating weather patterns and temperatures across the Northern Hemisphere. Anything that disrupts the Arctic will be felt further south, they say. Rex cited the polar vortices that blasted cold air as far as Florida last winter and the early summer heatwave in Europe as prime examples of the impact that a change in the Arctic weather system might entail."
         
" India is among the countries that stand to lose the most in terms of productivity from so-called heat stress arising from climate change, according to a new study by the International Labour Organisation. Heat stress, which refers to the increase in body heat from working and environmental conditions (apart from the kind of clothing worn) will lead to a productivity loss of 2.2% of total working hours around the world, equivalent to 80-million full-time jobs, by 2030, the report, released Monday said. India, owing to its large population and dependence on the agriculture and construction sectors, is expected to witness a productivity loss equivalent to 34 million full-time jobs or 5.8% of total working hours by 2030, according to the report. In comparison, China will lose 0.78% of its total work hours and would suffer productivity loss equivalent to 5.47 million jobs, while the United States will lose 0.21% of total work hours and 3.89 lakh jobs. Several Asian and African countries are projected to lose a higher percentage of work hours, with Chad losing 7.11%; Sudan, 5.9%; Cambodia 7.83% and Thailand 6.39% of working hours respectively. ILO’s report “Working on a Warmer Planet” said that the agriculture and construction sectors will be worst affected owing to the physical nature of work accounting for 60% and 19% of working hours lost due to heat stress respectively. South and West Asia are the most vulnerable. Assuming global warming of 1.5 degree C by the end of the century, heat stress in these two sub-regions will lead to the loss of 5.3% and 4.8% of working hours by 2030, corresponding to around 43 million and 9 million full-time jobs, respectively. The European region is expected to experience a smaller impact, with their productivity losses projected to be less than 0.1%. Economic losses due to heat stress globally were estimated to be US$280 billion in 1995 but this is projected to increase to US$2,400 billion in 2030, with the highest impact in lower-middle and low-income countries. Heat stress could prompt increased rural migration and inequalities in work conditions, with agricultural workers leaving rural areas in search of better prospects in the cities or in other countries. “Significantly, during the 2005-15 period, higher levels of heat stress were associated with larger out-migration flows – a trend not observed for the preceding 10-year period,” the report said. Urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon from concretisation will accentuate heat stress episodes, according to ILO. The phenomenon refers to an urban area being much warmer than its rural surroundings. ILO refers to a study from 2017 which analysed 1,692 cities and found that the total economic costs of climate change for cities in this century could be up to 2.6 times higher if UHI effects are taken into account. On average, cities could lose 5.6% of their GDP by the end of the century. Several studies have studied how UHI affects heat stress in India. An IIT Delhi study found several parts of Delhi sizzling in summer , with a temperature that was, in some cases, as much as 8.3 degree Celsius higher than surrounding areas. The ILO report cites Ahmedabad ‘s Heat Action Plan that provides access to affordable cool roofs to the city’s slum residents and urban poor as a positive initiative.“We need a similar plan for rural areas too. Some interventions are known, like drinking more water intake, afternoon naps, working in shifts, immediate medical attention in emergencies and cool roofs, but I don’t think labour ministry has started work on such plans. There should be inter-ministerial coordination and coordination with industry,” said Dileep Malvankar, director, Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar, and of the people instrumental in developing the Ahmedabad heat action plan."
" New technologies offer monumental opportunities to turbocharge the work of the United Nations for peace, sustainable development and human rights. Scientific progress is helping to cure deadly diseases, feed growing populations, drive economic growth and connect businesses, communities, families and friends across the world like never before. Rapidly developing fields such as artificial intelligence, blockchain and biotechnology hold great potential to improve well-being and generate innovative solutions for global challenges. The pace of change is remarkable. New technologies are leaping from the lab to global use at an unprecedented pace. More than 90% of all the data that exists today was produced in the last two years. As a tech leader said to me recently, even though the field already advances at lightning speed, future developments will never again be as slow as they are today. We must make full use of these life-saving and life-enhancing capacities. As the world strives to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals — the internationally agreed blueprint for building a better world for all — digital technologies can be especially helpful in those areas where the world is lagging behind the most. We must pursue inclusive approaches that bring together all stakeholders. And we must take serious steps to promote the meaningful participation of women and to train young girls in science, technology, engineering and maths. While many of us struggle to recall how we lived without the Internet, a gaping digital divide remains. For more than half the world’s population, access is expensive, slow or simply nonexistent. This divide is exacerbating inequalities in other key areas such as education, health and wealth. Digital opportunities must reach all, for the benefit of all. We must also recognise the threats posed by new technologies. Weapons systems that can identify and kill on their own are closer to becoming a reality; that is a a morally repugnant development. Social media is being used to spread hatred and lies. Technology is being exploited by terrorists, and organised criminal networks lurk on the dark web, profiting from encryption and near-anonymous cryptocurrency payments to traffic in people and illegal drugs. While innovation continues to open up new fields of employment, many workers fear their jobs will fall victim to automation, underscoring the need for large-scale retraining, expanded social protection schemes and education from the earliest grades that emphasises lifelong learning. We can and must do more to ensure that digital technologies are a force for good. That is why I established a High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation, which has just issued its report (https://digitalcooperation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DigitalCooperation-report-for-web.pdf). Led by Melinda Gates of the Gates Foundation and Jack Ma of Alibaba, the panel brought together diverse experts who consulted globally, debated vigorously and examined a wide spectrum of challenges, and put forward detailed recommendations for eliciting the best of new technologies. The panel has recommended ways to close the digital divide, increase cooperation, and better govern digital technology development through open, agile, and multi-stakeholder models. Classical forms of governance do not apply. Technology moves so fast that, by the time decision makers gather to prepare, discuss, approve, ratify and implement a convention or new agreement, the landscape has changed entirely. Analogue policymaking won’t work in a digital world. I welcome the High-Level Panel’s recognition of the United Nations as a uniquely legitimate and dynamic platform where governments, civil society, academia, the scientific community and the tech industry itself can come together to discuss the way forward. Beyond the UN’s convening power, our standard-setting, capacity-building and data-gathering efforts are also well-placed to contribute. I will devise a roadmap for the UN role going forward, and host any discussions that stakeholders would find useful. That conversation cannot wait. The age of digital interdependence deepens with each livestream, on-line transaction and path-breaking platform. As with other quintessential global phenomena — trade, communications, climate change and human mobility — international cooperation can be the difference between progress and chaos. We need to move now to build trust, stay ahead of emerging issues and shape a peaceful, prosperous and positive digital future for all. António Guterres is Secretary-General, United Nations"
            
" To beat the rising heatwave gripping Europe, animals at a zoo were given cool and refreshing ice lollies. In the Czech Republic, where a new June temperature record was set this week, the gorillas and polar bears at Prague’s zoo kept cool by eating their own version of frozen treat. Zookeepers presented the animals with big blocks of frozen water in a form that suits them, and with ingredients to suit their tastes. Later, the zoo took to Facebook to share a few posts containing the images and video of the animals enjoying their ice lollies. The gorillas had two blocks with a mixture of fruits inside, including pieces of orange, apple, pear, kiwi, carrot, pineapple and mango, hanging from ropes in their outdoor enclosure. The zoo’s eight Western lowland gorillas stuck to a clear hierarchy. Richard, the dominant male, had a chunk of ice for his own. The other seven shared one ice lolly among them all. The three polar bears got an icy block each with fish as the main ingredient."
            
" India is confronting a range of climate change-influenced effects, ranging from severe heat waves to an increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme rainfall and rising sea levels, the ministry of earth sciences has warned. The annual rate of sea level rise at some locations, according to studies available with the ministry, is comparable with the global average and actually higher in some cases. The Indian region has recorded a warming trend of 0.6 degree Celsius over pre-industrial levels, as per observational data available with the ministry of earth sciences, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, minister of state for health, said in reply to a question in the Lok Sabha. Data presented by him in the House also indicated that several coastal areas in India were recording a rise in sea levels. Diamond Harbour in West Bengal, for example, recorded a sea level rise rate of 5.16 mm per year between 1948 and 2005; Kandla in Gujarat recorded a sea level rise rate of 2.89 mm/year compared to a global average of 1.8 mm/year over the last century, according to the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). To be sure, this is comparable to the current level of increase. Current data with the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) indicates an average rate of sea level rise of 3.1 mm/year. “Globally, climate change impacts are already visible. We have very few studies on how climate change is impacting... coastal erosion, forest biodiversity or changes in crop yields. India’s impacts will be higher than global averages. We also have very limited, very high-quality modelling studies on how climate change will impact sectors. The US, the UK and Germany have these studies,” said NH Ravindranath, climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru Choubey was responding to a question on whether India had become vulnerable to extreme climate events like tsunamis, floods or droughts because of climate change. “Indian coast has a threat from Tsunami that can get generated due to large undersea earthquakes. The earthquakes and Tsunamis are not due to climatic variations. However the coastal inundation by tsunamis can exacerbate the impact on coastal zones due to sea level rise,” Choubey’s reply said. Choubey, in his answer, also said regions that are most prone to climate change impacts are central and north India and the western Himalayas, manifested in extreme rainfall, and in north and northwest India, in the form of moderate droughts."
     
           
         
        
          
                                       
     
" After activists expressed reservations about the AIIMS revamp project, Congress councillor from Andrews Ganj, Abhishek Dutt, has written to the Delhi government that the construction agency must not be given the nod to cut 315 trees for the new buildings. In his letter to the forest department dated June 21, 2019, Dutt wrote, “With the increasing demand of urbanisation, the soft target in the city’s expansion are the trees, green belt and forests… ensure no tree cutting permission is granted by yourselves to NBCC at Ayur Vigyan Nagar. The forest department must hold out against all odds to preserve the trees of Delhi.” The premier medical institute has roped in the National Buildings Constructions Corporation (NBCC India) to redevelop its Ayur Vigyan Nagar complex on August Kranti Marg to construct more flats for its staff. In February this year, the project got the environmental clearance from the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change. NBCC India in a letter dated May 13, 2019, wrote to the forest department once again seeking permission for felling 315 trees. The status of the permission sought is not known as the forest department was not available for comment. Environmentalists have been opposing the project citing major problems in the procedure adopted by the government agencies in assessing its impact on environment and traffic situation in the area. Kanchi Kohli, environment campaigner and researcher with the Centre for Policy Research (CPR), said, “The redevelopment of AIIMS housing colonies Ayur Vigyan and West Ansari Nagar is yet another attempt to commercialise public land in Delhi. The environmental approvals repeat all the problems related to inadequate tree assessments, pending water and traffic permissions and copy paste assessments. Delhi’s residents need much more regulatory seriousness and public scrutiny given the repeated failures coming to light.” Despite repeated attempts, NBCC India officials couldn’t be contacted for a comment."

" A starving polar bear has strayed hundreds of kilometres from its natural Arctic habitat and wandered, exhausted, into the major Russian industrial city of Norilsk in northern Siberia. The female bear, visibly weak and seemingly ill, lay despondently on the ground for hours on Tuesday in Norilsk’s suburbs, its feet caked in mud, occasionally rising to sniff around for food. It is the first polar bear seen in the city in more than 40 years, according to local environmentalists. Oleg Krashevsky, a local wildlife expert who filmed the polar bear close-up, said it was unclear what had brought the animal to the city, although it was possible it had simply got lost. He said it had watery eyes and could clearly not see well. Climate change has been damaging polar bears’ sea-ice habitats and forced them to scavenge more for food on land, bringing them into contact with people and inhabited areas. A state of emergency was declared in a remote inhabited area of northern Russian earlier this year when dozens of hungry polar bears were seen scavenging for food and entering public buildings and homes. State wildlife experts are expected to arrive in Norilsk on Wednesday to assess the bear’s condition. Local residents in the city known for nickel production came out to photograph the bear and look at it as police prevented them from getting too close. Krashevsky said it was not clear what would be done with the polar bear as it looked too weak to be taken back to its natural habitat."
" Air pollution may be strengthening the formation of tropical cyclones in the Arabian Sea, a US-based science agency has said, after Cyclone Vayu brushed past the west coast of India last week. Dr James Kossin, atmospheric research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), said human-induced emissions like black carbon and sulphates increased six-fold since the 1930s. These, he explained, were responsible for weakening weather systems like wind shear (rapid changes in wind speed combined with direction or height of moving winds), which can otherwise prevent cyclones from forming during the pre-monsoon months. “There is evidence that air pollution over the Arabian Sea has caused a reduction of the wind shear. When this is combined with warming oceans, which help cyclones become stronger, it allows Arabian Sea cyclones to get stronger,” said Kossin, in a statement issued last week. The India Meteorological Department (IMD), however, reacted sceptically to the NOAA release, saying that, barring isolated statements, there is no proof of air pollution or climate change impacting cyclones. “We need not be concerned by such statements regarding air pollution aiding cyclone formation or weakening of monsoons,” said Dr KJ Ramesh, IMD director general. “The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] report, a body of the United Nations, has clearly indicated a positive anomaly for above normal rainfall for India, irrespective of a high or low emissions scenario,” added Ramesh. Despite IMD’s stance, local studies have also concluded that pollution is affecting the weather. Research by the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) in 2018, found that increasing anthropogenic aerosol emissions over a 40-year period (1971-2010) had influenced the suppression of South Asian monsoon rainfall. Air pollution researchers said emissions and their direct impact on the formation of cyclones need to be studied further."
                
     
            
        
             
                   
                                              
" Iceland is known as the land of contrasts — fire and ice, black and white. It was into this landscape of extremes, in a summer that is barely summer but is still the best time to visit, that I went trekking in a desert of ice. It was a bit like being in a manga movie. All you hear is wind, and the sound of your crampons on glacial ice. You’re walking in a landscape of black volcanic rock, falling snow and blue ice. Trekking up the Sólheimajökull glacier in Iceland, everything is exaggerated — the colours look sharper, the sky larger, the horizon further. All the Nordic myths come to life. Perhaps this is where Odin used the poetic mead he obtained from Suttungr the Giant’s daughter. SURVIVAL KIT: Don’t go trekking in Iceland without… a swimsuit, sunglasses, a bottle of alcohol Lot of treks have hot geysers along the way; in such cases, a swimsuit for the more adventurous. Winter here stretches from September through May. Temperatures average -10 degrees C. This can seem intimidating, but if you layer up right you won’t really feel it. Thermals are a must; as are waterproof pants, and a knee-length fleece-lined coat. Take along a balaclava and be sure to pack waterproof gloves. In your backpack, keep energy bars and chocolates, sunglasses (the glare can be quite extreme), and sunblock. UV light hits you much harder at the poles. Keep small doses of rum on you, to keep you warm at night. Don’t overdo it. There’s nothing more annoying than a drunk or hungover trekker trying to keep up. The wind is crushing, blotting out most of your senses. Then it strikes you that you are walking on a sheet of ice on an island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. The glacier will never look like this again; in five years, it may not even be here. As if in agreement, the climate changes from hour to hour — sun, rain, snow. Along the trail on this 8-km-long, 2-km-wide glacier you come upon icy blue crevasses that seem to plunge to its core. Our day began at 8 am, with a two-hour drive from the Icelandic capital of Reykjavik to the southern tip of the glacier. We started out in pitch dark with the temperature at 4 degrees C and wind chill pushing it down to -1, but as we left the city, the sun started to light up a breathtaking vista of black volcanic mountains to one side and black sand beaches on the other. Here and there, waterfalls appeared, frothy, white, plunging into the black ground. The black, we learnt, comes from the lava that has been spewed across this landscape by the under-ice Katla volcano, which has erupted from time to time for over 900 years, most recently in 1918. We pulled up two hours later at a wooden hut full of ice picks, helmets, crampons, and pictures of past treks. Here we were given some much-needed hot black coffee and our trekking gear for the day. This is when we first got the sense of the mission we’d undertaken, if you like. The sense that, there will be nothing to keep you alive out there but what you were carrying. The first bit of our march added to that sense of the other-worldly. The eerie black continued here, making every curve and crevice seem unsettling; the sky above was overcast and promised rain. We arrived at the frozen Jökulsá á Sólheimasandi river and I finally realised a Viking fantasy here — in push-up position, I sipped directly from the stream of meltwater. How I wish I had a spear and shield, a bushy beard, or knew at least one Nordic swear word! Ten minutes into the trek my best friend and I spotted a small ice cave. We had an option of going around it, but we were here for adventure! So we crawled out to the other side, where the wind was whipping and all sound disappeared. The three hour Sòlheimajökul trek is less climbing and more hoping for dear life that your crampons will hold as you grapple up a 30-degree to 35-degree slope of black-ash-bearing slushy ice. From time to time, the landscape closes in and you’re crawling upward between walls of ice, hammering in your ice pick and hoping it’ll hold. Some of the inclines here are far steeper; as much as 60 degrees. The real adventure began when it started to rain, about an hour into the trek. After a quick shower the sun came out and suddenly it was like switching to Technicolor. The black became blacker; cool, minty hues of blue emerged around us as the air cleared. So absorbed were we by this breathtaking beauty that we didn’t realise the trek was done. The sun cheered us as we gathered at the tip of the glacier. Twenty minutes later, all of us, glacier included, were covered in a fresh layer of snow. Trotting on, with an occasional ice-cold shoe-dip-and-slip, we reached a point where all the eye could see was the vast expanse of the glacier. This was by far my favourite moment."
" Diesel vehicles transporting waste in the city generate toxic pollutants equivalent to 8.74 lakh vehicles driven for one year. The Environmental Science and Engineering Department (CESE) of the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) conducted a study of 7,092 trips made each day by 1,144 waste transport vehicles (989 private and 155 municipal vehicles) over a year. Their emissions were analysed for pollutants such as carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxide (NOx), and particulate matter (PM). Of the emissions, CO2 was the highest at 67,401.38 tonnes a year, equivalent to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 14,310 passenger vehicles driven in one year. NOx emissions were the second highest at 613.51 tonnes a year, followed by CO, HC, and PM emissions at 579.11 tonnes a year, 107.36 tonnes a year, and 99.94 tonnes a year, respectively. Emissions from the five pollutants are equal to GHG emissions from burning of coal from 22,478 railcars or 8.74 lakh vehicles driven for one year, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency greenhouse gas equivalencies calculator. Currently, in Mumbai, solid waste is managed through open dumping (69%) and partly bioreactor landfill (31%), which generates approximately 2.47 million tonnes of CO2 a year, the study said. “We found that the transportation of waste alone generates 0.07 million tonnes of CO2 a year, which is approximately 2.8% of the total greenhouse emissions produced from current waste management practices in Mumbai,” said Munish Chandel, associate professor, CESE IIT-B and co-author of the study. “Overall, if you compare emission from waste transport to overall emissions from passenger transport in Mumbai, it should not be more than 1%. However, waste transport produces additional emissions and contributes towards traffic congestion.” Numerous studies over the past decade have found how GHG emissions, including pollutants found in this study, are not only a cause for climate change, but also cause health ailments. “Direct exposure to the concoction of pollutants mentioned under the study can be directly damaging for the lungs and continuous exposure can be extremely detrimental for patients suffering from lung ailments, children or senior citizens,” said Dr Sanjeev Mehta, pulmonologist. “Large diesel vehicles are being used because they are able withstand heavy load of waste to landfills. However, since the study period, a 20% reduction in large vehicles has been achieved through segregation and waste management at source. The use of smaller vehicles emitting fewer pollutants has risen. All other public utility vehicles are running on cleaner fuels,” said an official from BMC’s solid waste management department."
" Pushed by Prince Charles on the issue of climate change, US President Donald Trump on Wednesday replayed his theme of blaming India, China and Russia for allegedly not doing enough, and insisted the US has one of the ‘cleanest climates’. Trump made the remarks during an interview with ITV on the last day of his three-day state visit. He joined Queen Elizabeth, France President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and others in Portsmouth to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings, before leaving for Ireland. Trump blamed India and other countries while withdrawing from the Paris climate accord in 2017, and reiterated the contention since. He had an extended discussion on Tuesday with Prince Charles on climate change, an issue on which the president is known to have serious reservations. According to Trump, Charles did most of the talking, and he ‘totally listened’. He lauded the prince’s passion for the subject, and said he countered the suggestion that the US should do more to combat climate change. Also read:US to end trade privileges for India on June 5, says Donald Trump He said: “I did say, ‘Well, the United States right now has among the cleanest climates there are based on all statistics.’ And it’s even getting better because I agree with that we want the best water, the cleanest water.” “China, India, Russia, many other nations, they have not very good air, not very good water, and the sense of pollution. If you go to certain cities … you can’t even breathe, and now that air is going up … They don’t do the responsibility.” Climate change was one of the issues in talks between Trump and Prime Minister May, reflecting demands before the state visit that he be confronted over his approach to it. A letter signed by 250 academics said his refusal to tackle global warming is “increasing risks for lives and livelihoods” around the world. Protests against Trump continued in Portsmouth, with images of the ‘Trump baby blimp’ appearing in bus shelters that were soon taken down as part of security for the D-Day event. Organisers were keen to ensure that the Trump visit does not overshadow the event to mark one of the most definitive battles of World War II.

" Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s victory in the general elections is a testament to his immense popularity across the country and his supreme talent as a campaigner. His sweeping victory gives Modi a mandate to pursue a bold agenda. As an Indian American who has followed Indian politics and its economy closely from afar, here are my suggested policies and priorities for an agenda the PM should implement in his second term. First and foremost, the PM would be wise to focus on jobs, education and healthcare, as well as climate change. Progress on all these areas depends on completing the economic reforms his government started in 2014. Therefore, one of the initial things the government should do is to recommit to reforms. Early in the first term, former finance minister Arun Jaitley initiated and completed reforms in key areas, including reforming the bankruptcy code, opening coal mining and railway sectors and allowing foreign investments in construction projects. However, after implementing the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the government’s enthusiasm for reforms seems to have waned altogether. According to the Washington-based think tank, Center for Strategic and International Studies, “not a single reform” has been completed since the GST was introduced in July 2017. So, it is imperative that the new finance minister begins her term by renewing and intensifying the pace of the reform by going ahead with land reform and deregulation of labour. At the moment, unemployment is the biggest challenge the world’s seventh largest economy is facing. Nearly 20 million youth are ready to enter the work force every year in India, which is a third of the population of Great Britain and Italy. To address this influx to the work force, the country needs to create nearly 55,000 jobs every day for the foreseeable future. That is a daunting, but not impossible task. To create jobs on that scale, the economy will need to grow by double digits. China did that consistently in the 1990s and 2000s. As recently as 2007, the Chinese economy grew at 14%. A big road block to achieving double-digit growth, however, is India’s poor infrastructure, which is not where it should be in spite of efforts by successive governments in the past two decades to create a world-class infrastructure. During this election cycle, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) promised to spend nearly $1.5 trillion to improve the infrastructure. If that money is spent judiciously, with a Marshall Plan-like blueprint, it will be a game changer for India. Almost certainly, India will be dependent on foreign investors for infrastructure money. But to attract investments at such a large scale, the government should tick all the remaining boxes in the reform to-do lists. Two other key areas where the government needs to multiply investments are education and healthcare. According to the World Bank, India ranks a miserable 143rd among countries in government spending on education. In order to develop a highly skilled work force, which is a prerequisite for meeting the overall developmental goals, public spending on basic, vocational and technical education is an absolutely necessity. Just as with education, the next government must have a big vision and a large-scale programme for healthcare. From preventive and prenatal care to greater access to healthcare in the rural areas, the challenges are many. The Ayushman Bharat Yojana scheme is expected to help as many as 500 million people. It is a great first step. In addressing healthcare challenges, PM Modi can enlist a huge pool of physicians of Indian origin around the globe, who are willing, ready and available to help. Another big challenge on the economic front that will have to be tackled is climate change. India must become a leader in combating climate change related issues. Investing in solar and wind energy, as well as implementing other eco-friendly initiatives, is not just a good environmental measure, it is also a good economic policy. Last, but not the least, the most disappointing occurrence during Modi 1.0 was the alienation of India’s hundreds of millions of religious minorities and Dalits. Modi 2.0 would do well to call for and take necessary steps to rein in the fringe elements. Modi’s call for a strong, fair, just, and inclusive India is a clear signal that he understands that the survival of the republic rests on the foundation of tolerance. I look forward to seeing the PM enable India to achieve its potential by encouraging and embracing the country’s diversity and inclusiveness. Diversity is vital in keeping India’s democracy healthy and vibrant. As an Indian American, I have had the privilege of living in the two largest — and I would add greatest — democracies in the world. That has been a gift. A greater gift would be to see the Indian democracy grow and flourish during Modi 2.0 under the governance of a truly democratic leader who would stand in stark contrast to the more autocratic and dictatorial national leaders who are emerging on the world stage today. Frank F Islam is an entrepreneur, civic leader, and thought leader based in Washington DC."
                        
                             
" Terming it to be a “serious issue”, the Delhi High Court on Friday sought the response of the Centre, Delhi Development Authority(DDA) and the Delhi government on a plea seeking directions to take proper and effective steps to protect the Jahanpanah City Forest and ensure that the nature and character of the city forest is not destroyed. A bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and justice Brijesh Sethi issued notices to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change(MoEF), DDA and the Delhi government. Advocate Amit Gupta had filed the public interest litigation (PIL) based on a Hindustan Times report highlighting the sorry state of affairs in the Jahanpanah city forest. The court also directed the three above mentioned parties to “file status reports with regard to the allegations and acts of commission and omission indicated in the petition” and listed the matter for August 28. On March 28, Hindustan Times had reported how illegal activities such as felling of trees, dumping of garbage, encroachment and open defecation by locals were threatening the Jahanpanah City Forest in south Delhi – one of the last dense green patches in the capital, sprawling over 435 acres. During a spot check, Hindustan Times had found that local residents were dumping domestic waste from across the boundary wall. Construction and demolition waste was scattered in many places. In some places, the base of trees was concretised, violating orders of the National Green Tribunal. There were hardly any guards at the gates and people were seen consuming drugs inside the forest area. The toilets were found abandoned, giving rise to open defecation. The forest department had also prepared a report highlighting the damage being done to the forest. The plea stated that urgent steps are required to be undertaken by the authorities by demarcation of the entire area to stop encroachment; by ensuring that efficacious afforestation is taken to compensate for the loss of 60–70 acres of land where plantation has been destroyed. It also sought that proper water supply should be provided by way of tube well and rain water harvesting systems and an effective mechanism to check illegal tree cutting and fire during the summers."
   
       
            
                        
" More than 100 students of city schools gathered at Galleria Market at noon on Friday to voice their concerns about climate change.. Dressed in their uniforms and waving placards, students chanted, “How is the pollution? High Sir!” “Twelve years is the time that we have to turn around climate change according to the United Nations,” said Veer Khanna, a student of The Shri Ram School Aravali and one of the organisers, as he blared into a microphone. Surrounding him were students from different schools, comprising representatives from city schools and also those who showed up to show their solidarity during the summer vacation. Parents watched on as the students delivered speeches and raised slogans. “The older generations are not going to do anything about climate change. It is up to us to take action and spread awareness,” said Vatsal Juneja, a Class 10 student of DAV Public School. Juneja, along with 16 other students from his school, volunteered to attend the event and were sent in the school bus. This was the second climate change protest in the city inspired by Greta Thunberg’s Friday protests outside the Swedish Parliament. The first one was held at the Wazirabad bundh in March, in which over 400 students participated. Avani Kothari, a student of Class 6 at The Shri Ram School, Moulsari, said she wanted people to stop using plastic. Although her views against plastic use were well received by the participants, not everyone seemed to practice it. As Kothari spoke, several senior students, standing behind her, were seen sipping beverages from plastic cups, tin cans and plastic bottles. The recent fight to save the Aravalli Biodiversity Park, in which students played a role, was also mentioned in the protest.    "
     
          
        
     
" Students from across the city are gearing up for a second march seeking proper action on climate change after the last protest on March 15 saw a good turnout. The march, scheduled for May 24 in line with the global climate strike for future, will begin from Galleria Market in DLF Phase 4 at 1pm. Students said they plan to march in the area for about two hours, holding placards and signs made from biodegradable and recyclable materials such as used cardboard boxes, old bedsheets and clothes. The climate strikes were initiated by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunburg, and come at a critical time. A UN report, released earlier this month, warned that one million species may be pushed to extinction in the next few years as a result of climate change and deforestation. Students said they want to highlight government inaction on climate change through mobilising the masses, and that close to 100 students have confirmed their participation so far. “As we have seen in other countries, people coming out to protest have led to some change. So we are using social media to reach out to students and many have shown the concerns similar to ours about climate change,” said 15-year-old Veer Ojas. Around 400 students had joined the protest last time. Ojas added that an Instagram handle by the name ‘Climate Action Gurugram’ was created a few days ago to promote the cause. Other students said they are using Facebook groups that they are part of to raise awareness and get people to join the protest. Ojas added he also addressed his school assembly twice this month to urge people to join in. Those leading the protest said they want the government to declare a climate emergency. “We are facing an unprecedented environmental emergency. The government should acknowledge and declare it as has been done in the UK and Ireland,” said 16-year-old Ragini Malhotra. Their demands also include a government ban on diesel generators, increase in forest cover in the city and withdrawal of the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) Amendment Bill, which the Haryana cabinet had passed in February this year, and which will open up at least 25,000 acres of PLPA-notified Aravalli land in Faridabad and Gurugram for real estate development."
   
          
       
    
           
         
" Sardines, considered the common man’s food in south India because of its affordability is thinning on dining tables as dwindling catch has sent the cost of the fish soaring by 400% to 800% in Kerala. Scientists attribute the falling harvest to climate change and El Nino effect. P J Lawrence has been a fisherman for 30 of his 45 years and an expert in spotting the catch. A native of Vizinjam he was once most sought after because of his ability to locate the shining schools of sardines by gauging water movement and light. But the ever dwindling catches have sent cost of sardine fishing up. “What is disturbing is that oil sardine is depleting fast. Since it is the main prey of other predator varieties their numbers are also declining simultaneously,” he said adding people like him end up in spending more on fuel and net in high seas. Changes are stark in fish markets. In Palayam fish market in Thiruvananthapuram, a kilo of sardines cost between ₹25- ₹50 last year. Now it costs more than ₹200 a kg, said a vendor. Climate change and increase in water temperature force fish like sardines to go to deeper portion of seas, she explained. Indian oil sardine is a sensitive pelagic fish (pelagic fish live neither bottom nor near the shore) whose biological cycle are easily be upset even due to slight differences in ocean ecosystem, said scientists of the Central Marine Research Institute. “El Nino has proven to be seriously influencing the growth and reproduction of oil sardine resources. It was also noted that sardine used to migrate from Malabar coast to the east coasts during El Nino years”, said senior scientist of CMFRI Dr Abdussamad who published a book on the wonder fish - ‘The Enigmatic Indian Oil Sardine: An Insight’. El Nino is a climatic pattern that occurs when sea surface temperature in tropical Pacific Ocean rises above normal levels. He said oil sardine in south Indian coast suffered growth retardation and spawning failure because of El Nino. “What is more alarming now is that El Nino struck again even before the resource recovered from biological stress like spawning failure in full scale which is likely to trouble sardine stock”, he said. Nutritionists say sardine is rich in numerous nutrients and one of the concentrated sources of omega 3 fatty acid which helps curb cardiovascular diseases. “Usually people prefer big fish. But more than big, small fish like sardines are good for health. Sardine is rich in Omega 3 fatty acid that helps in creating good cholesterol and better body metabolism,” said nutritionist Dr Lalitha Appukuttan of NIMS hospital. She said sardine is a reservoir of nutrients. According to CMFRI statistics sardine landings in the country in 2015 was 2,65667 tonne, 2,44992 tonne in 2016 and went up 3,37390 tonne in 2017. But in 2018 and early 2019 it came down drastically by at least 20 per cent. Scientists say thinning sardine is really worrisome because it affects the marine cycle badly."
" A landmark United Nations interagency report compares the threat from drug-resistant diseases to that from climate change and calls for urgent collaborative global action to prevent 10 million deaths annually by 2050 and economic losses as catastrophic as the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. If countries do not scale-up financing for new drug development and regulate misuse in human, animal and plant sectors, where antimicrobials are widely used as growth promoters, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) will push at least 24 million people into extreme poverty by 2030, said report by the UN Interagency Coordination Group (IACG) on Antimicrobial Resistance on Monday. Antimicrobial (including antibiotics, antivirals, antifungal and antiprotozoal) agents are critical to fight diseases in humans, animals and plants, but misuse and overuse is making an increasing number of them ineffective. “AMR is a threat to everyone, everywhere. The WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS) collects data from 71 countries including India, in which more than a third of countries reported widespread resistance to common pathogens. In some member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), about 35% of common human infections are already resistant to available medicines, and in some low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), resistance rates are as high as 80%-90% for some antibiotic-bacterium combinations. Resistance to second- and third-line antibiotics, the last lines of defence against some common diseases, are projected to almost double between 2005 and 2030,” said Dr Haileyesus Getahun, director of the IACG on Antimicrobial Resistance at the World Health Organization in Geneva, in an email interview. Drug resistance currently causes at least 700,000 deaths each year, including 230,000 from multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. The most common drug resistant pathogens, including E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Acinetobacter spp., S aureus, S pneumoniae, N gonorrhoeae, and Shigella spp, causing a variety of blood stream infections, respiratory tract infections, sexually transmitted infections and urinary tract infections, have increasingly become untreatable, according to GLASS data collated from 3,097 hospitals and 2,358 outpatients clinics in 2017. Concurrently, inadequate access to existing antibiotics kills nearly 6 million people annually, including a million children who die of preventable sepsis and pneumonia, said Dr Getahum. “If there isn’t collective leadership and action between governments, pharmaceutical companies, international agencies and civil society, predictions suggest there could be as many as 10 million deaths worldwide by 2050. This would mark a return to the old days of people dying from common infections and injuries,” said Dr Getahun. Learning from climate change, the Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance comprising WHO, World Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Organisation for Animal Health, has called for a “One Health” approach with agencies responsible for human, animal and environment health working together like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The report recommends prioritising national action plans to scale-up financing and capacity-building efforts, including putting in place stronger regulatory systems, prudent use of antimicrobials by professionals in human, animal and plant health, investing in research and development for new drugs and technologies to combat antimicrobial resistance, and urgently phasing out the use of critically important antimicrobials as growth promoters in agriculture. Unregulated and widespread sale and misuse of antibiotics have amplified the AMR crisis in India, where poor access to clean water and sanitation, inadequate health care infrastructure and weak food safety and waste management systems are increasing infectious diseases in animals and humans and contributing to the spread of drug-resistant infections. “There is a need for reliable and validated diagnostics for rapid and early diagnosis of drug resistance, both in India and globally, to reduce AMR-associated complications and deaths and lower hospitalization and length of hospital stay to consequently decrease cost of healthcare. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)’s AMR diagnostics taskforce is mandated to establish a mechanism for the validation of rapid AMR diagnostics and develop target product profiles for diagnostics in the country,” said Dr Kamini Walia, programme officer AMR, division of epidemiology and communicable diseases, ICMR. India’s national programme on containment of AMR launched in 2017 is floundering because of a lack of leadership. Banning fixed drug combinations have worked, but the redline campaign (red line on medicine packages to mark sale against prescription only) needs to be strengthened. “The Indian Council of Agricultural Research has banned certain drugs for growth promotion, but better convergence is needed for ongoing initiatives, including whether AMR programmes should be run by the Centre or driven by the states,” said a scientist in the health ministry who did not want to be named."
" In his heyday, Panchanan Pal was the pride of Ghoramara. Pal and his family had 20 bighas (roughly a third of an acre) of prime farmland, and Pal went to university after finishing high school – a rare feat in the underdeveloped Sunderbans area at the southern tip of Bengal. But what really made him popular in one of the largest islands in the delta was his drama club. Pal and a small group of men and women would travel across Bengal, and often as far as Delhi or Hyderabad, to perform one-act plays in Bengali. One time, he says, he came across legendary Bengali comic Rabi Ghosh, and another time, bested top theatre actor Chinmay Ray in a competition. “Our island was number one; and there was a pride in our culture and education,” reminisced Pal, now 63. His son, Chandan, 23 years old and a first-time voter in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, knows little of this — mostly because he doesn’t live there anymore. About three decades ago the waters of the local Muriganga river that pours into the Bay of Bengal a couple of kilometres further south surged through the mud-and-brick barriers one day, inundating the fringes of their fields. By the next year, the waters were crashing around the edge of their pond. “Now just three bighas are left of our 20-bigha land. The rest is under water,” said Chandan, standing outside their two-room thatched house in Sagar island, where most of the original inhabitants of Ghoramara have settled.   Roughly half of Ghoramara has disappeared over the past three decades, with rising water levels in the local river and sea hastening erosion at the shorelines. From a population of 20,000, roughly 3,000 people remain on the island now and are constantly shifting. “Younger people are leaving their homes, and settling on the mainland,” said Chandan, adding that mostly older people are left on the island that is now connected to the rest of the state only through a twice-a-day ferry. “At least it is still there; islands we would frequent with our drama club like Lohachora have disappeared completely,” chimed in Pal. Chandan now runs an e-rickshaw in Sagar, the largest island in the delta now and home to the famous Gangasagar Mela. He has three uncles left on the island and hopes that the government rehabilitates them soon. His family, and thousands like them, is among India’s first climate refugees in a region where the fragile ecosystem has been devastated by the vagaries of climate change. But as Bengal hurtles towards another election, theirs are not issues that the political leaders are thinking about. NEW HOME Sagar is where everyone comes. As the largest island in the Sunderbans delta, and the main hub for supplies ranging from fish to petrol, the 200-sq-km island is home to roughly 170,000. People come from all over the Sunderbans area, to catch ferries to the mainland, for jobs, for celebrations, education (it has a college and a good high school), and of course, to pray at the holy confluence of the Hoogly with the sea. The latest influx is of people fleeing erosion and rising water levels. Chandan and his father live in Bankim Nagar, one of several hutments created by the then Left Front government in the 1990s to settle the refugees. But as the numbers swelled, the sizes of the allotments shrunk. The Pals had received roughly three acres of land, a pond, and a few coconut trees. His brothers are likely to receive only one acre, if at all the government rehabilitation plan is approved. Chandan has thrown himself into his new life with zest. After failing the high-school leaving examinations, he began working as a painter, helping local offices and religious institutions – there is one at almost every bend of the road – spruce up their exteriors every few years. “I know who likes which colour, and how to do the best kind of distempering,” he said proudly, pointing at the colour of the bench he is sitting on – “golden yellow!” A car accident two years ago cut short his career as a painter when higher floors became inaccessible to him because of a leg injury. It was then that he took to running an e-rickshaw, known locally as a Toto. “I am now the secretary of the local Toto union. I have 80 boys under me, and we make a killing every Gangasagar Mela,” he said. He is especially proud of his brief hobnob with Bengali journalists who came to cover the Gangasagar Mela last year. “We set up a quick food delivery system with customised menus, and none of the babus could stop eating,” he said, flashing a smile. His income? Anywhere between ?400 and ?700 a day. His occupation has triggered some consternation in his father, a retired government clerk, who doesn’t approve of his blue-collar job. Chandan has to often hear jibes about his English and is called a “nincompoop” fairly regularly. LIVING ON THE EDGE A collection of roughly 102 islands, around half of which are inhabited, the Sunderbans mangrove archipelago is a crucial carbon sink and eastern India’s biggest protection against coastal flooding. But steady erosion over the past three decades has ensured that about a dozen islands are already underwater, and others – such as Mousuni and Ghoramara – are teetering on the brink. A 2016 paper published in Climatic Change journal said the Sunderbans – with an average elevation presently approximately 2 metres above mean sea level – was “under threat from inundation and subsequent wetland loss”. Tuhin Ghosh, one of the authors of that article and a professor at Jadavpur University, says the Sunderbans area is battling a multitude of climatic factors: Rising sea levels, shifting monsoon patterns, higher rainfall, and fewer very rainy days – which means the intensity of rainfall on certain days of the year have become harsher. To be sure, he is of the opinion that climate change is not the only factor responsible, and that human error – for example, the imperfect and incomplete building of guide walls in nearby ports that has changed the course of the local rivers – is equally responsible. Chandan and his father know nothing of this. They and other refugees, many of whom are Dalits or Muslims (the local Lok Sabha constituency is reserved for scheduled castes), are too busy eking out a living. But they are wary of the future, even building themselves a pucca house because they know that their new home is sinking too. Sagar is facing erosion on the northern and western fronts, and has already lost roughly 30-sq-km of land, say experts. This means that Chandan’s fear finds reflection in his neighbours, who are all wary of where they will go next if displaced again. “I have given my life’s worth to building ourselves a new house, where will we go if this island is gone? Everyone takes their home for granted, their land for granted. What is there for us?” he asked. Another neighbour, Srimati Sahu, says she feels scared everyday. “We know Sagar is sinking. What if the government says leave – after all, the allotment of land has stopped since 2005,” she said. In the minds of many Ghoramara refugees, the island – which, legend has it, was named after a British officer who killed his horse -- has been romanticised. “We had everything in plenty. The kind of rice and paan we would grow you cannot imagine,” said Pal, while Chandan nodded in disapproval. MY VOTE GOES TO... For the first time in Sagar, saffron flags of the BJP are fluttering on street corners. But Chandan and his father are united in their assessment that the party will not pose a significant challenge to the Trinamool Congress incumbent, CM Jatua, from the Mathurapur Lok Sabha constituency. Their reasons, of course, differ. The senior Pal, a former diehard communist, says many people’s votes would be dictated by the fear of retaliatory violence from the ruling party. Besides, what stops him from even considering the BJP candidate is that he is not a local, and not widely known in the area. The junior Pal has another reason: chief minister Mamata Banerjee. “Look at what she has done for us. We couldn’t walk on these roads without our feet getting caked with mud; now we can sleep on them given how clean they are. She has brought electricity, given us streetlights, and is thinking about us. I have 80 boys under me, and each has about five people in their families, that means 400 votes for Didi,” he said."
        
                         
               
" Global warming has caused the Indian economy to be 31 per cent smaller than it would otherwise have been, according to a Stanford study which shows how Earth’s temperature changes have increased inequalities. The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that growing concentrations of greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere since 1960s have enriched cool countries like Norway and Sweden, while dragging down economic growth in warm countries such as India and Nigeria. “Our results show that most of the poorest countries on Earth are considerably poorer than they would have been without global warming,” said climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh, from Stanford University in the US. “At the same time, the majority of rich countries are richer than they would have been,” Diffenbaugh said in a statement. The study from 1961 to 2010, global warming decreased the wealth per person in the world’s poorest countries by 17 to 30 per cent. Meanwhile, the gap between the group of nations with the highest and lowest economic output per person is now approximately 25 per cent larger than it would have been without climate change. While the impacts of temperature may seem small from year to year, they can yield dramatic gains or losses over time. “This is like a savings account, where small differences in the interest rate will generate large differences in the account balance over 30 or 50 years,” said Diffenbaugh. After accumulating decades of small effects from warming, India’s economy is now 31 per cent smaller than it would have been in the absence of global warming, he said. Although economic inequality between countries has decreased in recent decades, the research suggests the gap would have narrowed faster without global warming. The study builds on previous research in the team analysed 50 years of annual temperature and GDP measurements for 165 countries to estimate the effects of temperature fluctuations on economic growth. They demonstrated that growth during warmer than average years has accelerated in cool nations and slowed in warm nations. “The historical data clearly show that crops are more productive, people are healthier and we are more productive at work when temperatures are neither too hot nor too cold,” said Marshall Burke, a Stanford assistant professor of Earth system science. “This means that in cold countries, a little bit of warming can help. The opposite is true in places that are already hot,” said Burke. Researchers combined data from more than 20 climate models developed by research centres around the world. Using the climate models to isolate how much each country has already warmed due to human-caused climate change, the researchers were able to determine what each country’s economic output might have been had temperatures not warmed. “For most countries, whether global warming has helped or hurt economic growth is pretty certain,” said Burke. Tropical countries, in particular, tend to have temperatures far outside the ideal for economic growth. “There’s essentially no uncertainty that they’ve been harmed,” he said."
          
        
        
       
" You already know that allergy season has arrived when you sneeze your head off frequently. A new study has found that allergy season has worsened because of increased pollen count and changing the climate. As reported by CNN, low-income households and kids tend to be at higher risk of catching diseases like Asthma, because of exposure to pollen. With rising temperature, the situation is likely to get worst for allergies because plants like ragweed will start migrating. “Warmer temperatures allow the trees to pollinate earlier and for longer times. We didn’t used to see our cars covered in pollen before March, but we do now, and we hear from people all the time who are dealing with allergies for a lot longer than they used to when they were little. That’s definitely connected to,” CNN quoted Angel Waldron, as saying. If the temperature continues to increase at its current stride, it is expected that by the end of the century, the growing season will be longer by about a month in most part of the world. Places that did not witness the pollen-producing flora will soon see them in plenty, exposing whole new populations to pollen. It’s not just the warmer temperatures adding to our misery. Plants love some carbon dioxide, and when there is more of it in the atmosphere due to the greenhouse gases causing climate change, they flourish. Studies on ragweed show that the amount of pollen the plant produces actually doubles with higher levels of CO2. The pollen becomes more potent too, according to the US Department of Agriculture. There are similar patterns for grass pollen and other plants. How to reduce the impact pollen The impact of technology on health-care has made available plentiful of allergy medications at the pharmacy. The consulted doctor should be able to help identify what triggers the allergies, so one can avoid them. Spend possibly least duration outside between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., especially on days when the Environmental Protection Agency’s AQI says the pollen count is high in your neighbourhood. Use AQI monitoring mobile applications to track the quality of air around. To prevent pollen to enter inside, leave your footwear at the door. Change your clothes if you’ve been outside for a long duration. Tidy the pets who have to go out. “Hair works a bit like a mop, collecting pollen that’s floating in the air,” Waldron said. “Since hair is the closest thing to your nasal passages, it can really bother you. If you wash it or brush it out before you go to sleep, or at least cover it, then you won’t be sleeping in all that pollen.” Climate Change can also be controlled through simple amendments inside the home like - Turning out the lights while leaving the room, using energy-efficient light bulbs, unplug electronic appliances when not in use, do not use hot water for washing clothes and most important use public transport or carpool to reduce the number of trips you take in the car. All of these can help to control greenhouse gases emission in the environment. Make sure to carry good quality mask to prevent asthma & allergy. Vacuum cleaners with HEPA filters are helpful to improve indoor air quality. Also, make sure it has asthma & allergy friendly certification mark to make sure they will be your best defense against the yellow stuff."
" Scores of students from schools and universities across Delhi Friday gathered outside the Union ministry of environment forest and climate change as part of the ongoing global school strikes for climate action. “We are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction,” students wrote in a memorandum submitted to Ritesh Kumar Singh, the joint secretary of the ministry. “We will be the ones to suffer the most in spite of the fact that we had no role in the destruction of the planet.” The protest was a part of the ‘Fridays for Future’ movement organised by school children across the globe who plan to take the streets Fridays -- at least once a month -- to protest the government’s inaction to curb climate change. Last year, the movement was kick-started by Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old girl from Sweden, who refused to go to school until politicians took action against climate change. With colourful banners and costumes made of plastic, students braved the April sun to raise their voices against global warming, industrial pollution, deforestation, droughts, and environmental migration among other issues. The students also raised questions over Punjab Land Preservation Act, environmental clearances for coal mining in Chhattisgarh, and melting of Himalayan ice caps. “I wanted to join Greta Thunberg’s movement so I convinced my school to join in since climate change affects everyone. Each one of us will have to take steps and we as children have to take this burden of the mistakes that all of you have made,” said Shivi, a student from Pathways School in Gurugram. Emphasising on the impending crises, Mehr Sogoi of The Foundation School (Indian School) said, “This is our last chance to act before the world collapses into an irreversible crisis. We want our government to take action and that is now.” Srijani Datta, a Class 12 student of Bloom Public School, who was among those who met Singh, said students must be head on about these issues. “The idea was to get our demands forward and create pressure on the ministry. I wanted to ask about felling of 17,000 trees in Sarojini Nagar. One should plant 10 trees for every tree that is cut. That is not happening.” The students also raised questions over the tree transplant policy."
" Amid gloom-and-doom predictions on the impact of climate change, a global research study has, for the first time, projected that a global transition to 100% renewable energy is possible by 2050 across all sectors, including power, heat generation, transport and desalination, provided there is political will to achieve it. The study underlines that it is possible to achieve the target under the 2015 Paris Agreement to keep rise in global average temperatures within 2 degrees Centigrade over pre-industrial levels. The study, released on Friday by Berlin-based Energy Watch Group and Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology in Finland, has used a modelling exercise to simulate the complete transition to renewable energy in nine major world regions. The modelling computes the most cost-effective mix of technologies based on locally available renewable energy sources. Dedicated to Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg and her #FridaysforFuture movement that calls for school strikes for climate, the study is based on four and half years of research and modelling computations by 14 scientists. It states that the transition will require mass electrification of all sectors. Electricity generation in 2050 will be four to five times higher than in 2015, which will cut dependence on fossil fuels. In fact, electricity will meet 90% of the energy demand in 2050, compared to fossil fuels meeting 89% of the energy demand in 2015. South Asian countries, including India, will have a world record share of 95% solar photo-voltaic electricity generation by 2050, according to estimates by the study. In Eurasia, onshore wind energy generation will be among the highest worldwide. The study also suggests that a global energy system dependent completely on renewable energy will be cheaper than the current system, falling from approximately 54€/megawatt hour (MWh) in 2015 to 53€/MWh by 2050. This transition will lead to a decline in annual global greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector from 30 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2eq) in 2015 to zero by 2050. “The study’s results show that all countries can and should accelerate the current Paris Climate Agreement targets,” said Christian Breyer, professor for Solar Economy at Finland’s LUT. “A transition to 100% clean, renewable energies is very realistic – even today, with the technologies currently available.” “The report shows that it’s technically and financially possible to transition to 100% renewable energy for all the sectors, especially when the costs are comparable to conventional energy systems. However, there needs to be enough safeguards to manage variability and the scale of deployment of these technologies, which will be critical to manage costs,” said Karan Mangotra, associate director and climate specialist at The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI). “The sectors which are harder to abate will find it challenging to go 100% renewable. The report, however, does give a direction that any country on the verge of making decisions on energy systems should look at investments in renewable energy,” said Mangotra. Heat supply in 2050 will be dominated by heat pumps (to move heat from one place to another using a compressor). The study also talks about synthetically produced gas and fuels to meet energy needs, transport and heating. “The study shows that the whole world can make the transition to a zero emission energy system. That is why all political powers around the world can and should do much more to protect our climate than they currently envision,” said Hans-Josef Fell, former member of the German Parliament and president of the Energy Watch Group. The study is significant because the community of climate scientists has been calling for such an unprecedented transition. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s “Global Warming of 1.5 degree C” report had said that countries have to make unprecedented transitions in all sectors to avoid devastating consequences of climate change and keep global warming within 1.5 degrees over pre-industrial levels. Commitments to cut down carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, submitted by 195 nations under the Paris agreement, will fail to keep global warming under 1.5 degree, the report had said."
" Two major scientific institutes have come together to map, validate and protect wetlands that are smaller than 2.25 hectares across India’s 7,516.6km coastline, to build resilience against the impact of climate change. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the Space Applications Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad under Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and Indian Council of Agricultural Research- Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (ICAR-CMFRI), Kochi on Tuesday to this effect. As per the MoU, the institutes aim to identify and demarcate wetlands, and protect them through coastal livelihood programs. Wetlands act as a buffer zone between the land and sea, protect land from erosion and act as a shield against cyclones and other ecological disasters. The MoU, under the National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) launched by the Centre in February 2011, is a boost for wetland conservation in Maharashtra. HT had reported on January 5 that Maharashtra had stopped identifying coastal wetlands since they were already protected under coastal regulation zone (CRZ) norms. Studies have found that climate change is resulting in mean sea level rise because of thermal expansion of water. This expansion is due to a rise in global temperatures, which in turn is leading to flooding concerns in low-lying coastal areas. “When coastal areas get inundated, they become marshy tidal points, which later become degraded wetlands,” said Grinson George, senior scientist, ICAR-CMFRI, Kochi. “Secondly, global warming causes isolated incidents of torrential rains bringing in a lot of silt along coastal zones. This reduces existing depth of shallow or small wetlands.” The two institutes will develop a smartphone application and webcast their conservation efforts to coastal stakeholders, the MoU said. “Our primary aim will be to organise a network to help local communities find economical gains using these wetlands. Activities such as aquaculture and crab farming will be promoted and these communities will also upload wetland information on our servers,” said George. “Along with satellite data, we can also conduct a validation exercise of wetlands and issue advisories for natural disasters or health issues.”"
    
     
" The one thing that annoys me no end about the election campaign in India is that nobody even bothers to talk about the environment. Climate change doesn’t even get a look in. Air pollution is not an issue for any political party. And not one political leader feels remotely concerned that we are destroying the planet on which our children and grandchildren will one day live – assuming that they can cope with the rising temperatures, water shortages, and such natural disasters as floods and hurricanes. But after fulminating for weeks I have decided that there is no point beating myself up about this. Instead, it is better to take a constructive approach and do my little bit in my own life to leave the world a better place – or at the very least, as a place worth living in. So here, for what it’s worth, are my top tips to do your bit for the environment. If you can think of any more, please feel free to add to the list. * Carry a cloth bag with you when you go shopping for groceries or vegetables. By the end of the year, you will have ensured that there are hundreds less plastic bags in circulation. * If you do end up taking plastic bags homes, make sure that you dispose of them responsibly. Don’t just dump them on the street or even in a roadside bin from which they could fly out and potentially be eaten by a cow or a dog. Not only is this disastrous for the health of the animal, you will also end up introducing more plastic in the food chain. And like karma, it will find it’s way back to bite you in the posterior – or more accurately, it will come back as you bite your food 10 years down the line. * Look for brands that do minimal packaging. And choose them every time over those who pack their products in layers and layers of plastic. * Throw out all those plastic water bottles from your kitchen. Invest in a set of glass water bottles. This will be good not just for the environment but for you as well. There is evidence to suggest that drinking out of plastic bottles – especially those that have been left out in the sun – can lead to your water being contaminated with dangerous compounds. And that’s quite apart from the fact that a plastic water bottle takes 450 years to degrade. (Yes, you read that right: 450 years.) And that a substantial number of them end up in our oceans where they endanger marine life for decades to come. * If you are eating out in a restaurant where you know the water is safe, don’t order bottled water. Even one less plastic bottle in circulation is a plus. * Unless you have a medical condition or a disability, say no to straws. Plastic straws make a disproportionate contribution to environmental waste, taking up to 200 years to decompose. Many food and drink outlets in India have made the move from plastic to paper straws. But even though these are biodegradable they are still a drag on the environment. So just say no to straws if you don’t really need them. * In the Delhi winter, when it gets bitterly cold outside, give the guards a heater. Pool your resources and make sure that your Residents Welfare Association (RWA) gives all the colony’s watch staff some shelter and heating. Not only is this the humane thing to do, it is imperative to ensure that there are not a hundred bonfires raging all across your neighbourhood, further contributing to air pollution. * Reduce your carbon footprint by eating local as much as possible. Choose apples from Kashmir rather than New Zealand; cherries from Himachal rather than Japan; melons from Punjab rather than Bangkok. And yes, eat seasonal as much as possible. * It is said that the mark of a great society is when old men and women plant trees whose shade they will never sit under. So, put aside a little bit every month for planting trees. It doesn’t matter if you don’t have a garden or even a small patch of green. There are many reforestation efforts being waged in our villages and hills. Find one such campaign that you can get on board with and make them a generous contribution. This is one of the best ways to offset your carbon footprint. * If that seems a huge ask, then start small. Invest in potted plants that are proven to improve air quality and place them in strategic areas around the house and in your balcony. It may not amount to much, but in crisis situations every little bit helps. * Most important of all, cut down on your water consumption. I am not saying you need to revert to the days of bucket baths but taking a shower rather than a bath will save tons of water every year. Not using a hose pipe to clean your car will do the same. And don’t forget to recycle the run-off water when you use your RO machine. Store it in buckets and use it for cleaning the house or watering your plants. As the saying goes, waste not, want not. Let that be your mantra as you go about saving the world, one drop of water at a time.

" The lives and futures of more than 19 million Bangladeshi children are at risk from the colossal impact of devastating floods, cyclones and other environmental disasters linked to climate change, according to a report by the United Nations children’s agency released Friday. The UNICEF report said the estimate includes hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugee children from Myanmar who are living in squalid camps in Bangladesh’s coastal district of Cox’s Bazar. The report says that because of the impact of climate, families across Bangladesh, a low-lying delta nation crisscrossed by more than 130 rivers, have migrated to big cities from villages after losing their livelihoods to increasing salinity in arable land, flooding, or river bank erosion. It documents children being forced into sex trafficking or marriage to survive. Around 12 million of the most affected children live in and around the powerful river systems which regularly burst their banks, UNICEF’s Dhaka spokesman, Jean-Jacques Simon, told the AP. “In the big cities... thousands of children arrive every day with their parents ... who are quite vulnerable to all kinds of exploitations,” Simon said. Another 4.5 million children live in vast coastal areas regularly struck by powerful cyclones, including almost half a million Rohingya refugee children living in fragile bamboo and plastic shelters, according to the report."
          
    
           
" Former Northern Army Commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda submitted his vision paper on national security to Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Sunday, stressing the need for measures to improve internal security while also protecting the country’s borders, people with knowledge of the developments said. Lt Gen Hooda (retired) was picked by the Congress to head its task force on national security. He was the main architect of the surgical strikes carried out by the Army in 2016 on terror launch pads across the Line of Control. “Lt General (Retd) DS Hooda and his team have put together a comprehensive report on India’s national security that he presented to me today. This exhaustive report will at first be discussed and debated within the Congress party. I thank him and the team for their effort,” Rahul Gandhi tweeted on Sunday. The report could be released along with Congress’s manifesto on Tuesday, a person aware of the developments said on condition of anonymity. A Congress leader privy to the contents of the report said it touches upon various aspects of national security. The document talks not only about the territorial integrity and protection of the borders but also about how to secure the country’s populace, the leader said, asking not to be named. The report has stressed the need to look at issues such as climate change, which is affecting farmers, and the need to increase employment. It mentions that the country needs to adapt to “huge technological changes” taking place across the globe, and whether appropriate education and skilling systems are being created to meet the challenges, the leader said. Apart from security of the borders and counter-terrorism operations, the report also suggests measures to build capabilities in terms of strengthening areas such as the military, police, intelligence and cyber and energy security. It calls for looking at national security in a holistic manner and suggests measures to address the internal challenges such as riots, unrest and agitations by a large “dissatisfied” population, the Congress leader said. The report also talks about strengthening the weaponry system of all wings of the armed forces and also seeks modernisation of the police force that deals directly with the citizens, he added. Lt Gen Hooda had met the Congress president recently and agreed to head the party’s panel that also comprised professionals such as diplomats and senior police officers. In December last year, he had remarked that it would have been better if the 2016 surgical strikes were carried out secretly. The Congress president used the remarks as a handle to attack Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alleging that he used the strikes for political capital.

" Jindal Global Law School (JGLS) in association with WWF-India has launched a Masters Programme in Environmental Law, Energy and Climate Change, an official said on Thursday. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to this effect was signed between the two institutions here on Wednesday in the presence of Supreme Court judges Justices D Y Chandrachud and Deepak Gupta besides two Judges from the Supreme Court of Hawaii, USA, Justices Michael D Wilson and Justice Sabrina McKenna. The course is open to law graduates who want to develop specialist legal knowledge on national and global environmental issues. The law professionals working in the field of environment will also be benefitted by this programme, the official said. Speaking on the occasion, Justice Chandrachud termed climate change as an existential threat and the most important issue facing humanity today. He spoke of the threat posed by water scarcity in India as well as across the world and the extinction of various species due to global warming and the marked increase in natural disasters due to deforestation and climate change that has resulted in environmental refugees. Speaking about the role of judiciary in environmental justice, he said: “The rule of law in environmental governance is seen as an aid in recognising of environmental injustices faced by vulnerable groups such as indigenous tribes, women and livelihood reliant communities.” “It seeks to empower them. Ecological sustainability cannot exist without the rule of law,” he added. Justice Deepak Gupta highlighted the need for equal access to environmental justice and urged the civil society to be more aware and proactive in protecting the environment. “Court and judiciary can just pass orders. To reach the desired solution, administration and public will have to come forward and act as well,” he said. “Otherwise, the country will keep moving from critical to extremely unhealthy environment leading to further damages and climatic changes. And for this one needs not only education, but sensitivity too,” he added. Speaking about the new course, Professor C Raj Kumar, Founding Vice Chancellor, JGU said, “The theme of environmental law and climate change is probably the most important issue that universities and law schools should be concerned about.” “There is a sense of responsibility on the part of higher education institutions to be able to address issues that are going to have significant implications for the future,” he added. “Environment is one such thing, but even more importantly, legal institutions and laws have a very significant role in speaking truth to power. Public policy and law have that goal and with that objective we are launching the Master of Laws programme in collaboration with WWF-India,” Kumar said."
" The Centre has approved the budget proposal of Rs 9.55 crore made by the Noida authority for upgrade and maintenance of the Okhla Bird Sanctuary. The first instalment of funds from the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) as well as the state agency was released this week, officials said. Both the Centre and the authority’s forest department have released a total of Rs 1.66 crore as of now. The funds will be used for habitat improvement in the sanctuary with better cleaning of water and the sanctuary area. Besides, a cafeteria and rest room will be set up. Also, golf carts will be bought for ferrying tourists, while plantation and sanitation will be improved. The entry gate and the Interpretation Centre are some proposed infrastructure that are more cost-intensive, and will come up when more funds are released, officials said. “We had submitted the proposal some time back and a meeting was held earlier this month to approve it. The cost is being shared wherein the ministry will provide Rs 5 crore and the authority will give Rs 4.55 crore. The ministry has released Rs 1 crore and the Noida authority has issued Rs 66 lakh. The work will begin after the general elections scheduled for April 11 in the district,” P K Srivastava, divisional forest officer, said. The funding proposal for the bird sanctuary was revised multiple times in the past one year. Before a proposal was made last year, no funding had been given for the sanctuary for several years. Realising the need for maintenance, the forest department had submitted an ambitious plan earlier last year to revive the sanctuary at a cost of Rs 99 crore, turning it into a biotourism hotspot. While the proposal was approved by the state government as well as the Union ministry, enough funds were not available with any of the agencies to be sanctioned for the sanctuary. Thereafter, the budget was revised several times and reduced to about Rs 50 crore and then to about Rs 14 crore. A total reduced budget of Rs 9.5 crore has finally been approved for the maintenance of the bird sanctuary. Authority officials said that through September and October last year, the water hyacinth was cleared, the sanctuary was cleaned and painted, and the bamboo bridge was mended with the department’s internal budget. Besides, one of the watch towers was also repaired by the department. Over 25,000 birds were spotted during this winter, which, according to officials, is higher than what was seen in the past years."
" With the melting of glaciers and snow due to high temperatures, Mount Everest expedition operators are finding more and more bodies of climbers on and around the world’s highest peak. More than 200 mountaineers have died on the peak since 1922, when the first climbers’ deaths on the Everest were recorded. Most bodies have remained buried under glaciers or snow, CNN has reported. “Due to climate change and global warming, snow and glaciers are melting fast, and bodies are being exposed and discovered by climbers,” said Ang Tshering Sherpa, former President of the Nepal Mountaineering Association. “Since 2008, my company has brought down seven bodies, some dating back to a British expedition in the 1970s,” he said. According to studies, glaciers in the Everest region are melting and thinning. “It’s a serious issue. We are concerned about this as it’s getting worse,” said Sobit Kunwar, an official of the Nepal National Mountain Guides Association. “We are trying to spread information to have a coordinated way to deal with it,” he said. The association’s Treasurer, Tenzeeng Sherpa, said climate change was affecting Nepal with glaciers, in parts, melting by a meter every year. “We bring down most bodies. But for those that could not be brought down we pay ours respects by saying prayers and covering them with rocks or snow,” Sherpa said. He lamented poor response of authorities in dealing with bodies found on the mountain. “We have not seen the government taking any responsibility,” he said."
        
" Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Indian Institute of Technology Mandi and Indian Institute of Science Bengaluru collaborate in a pan-Indian, multi-institutional initiative to develop a ‘Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment for the Indian Himalayan Region Using a Common Framework.’ The assessment exercise is unique because for the first time all the 12 Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) States have used a common framework resulting in the production of comparable state level and within state, district level vulnerability maps. Such comparable vulnerability assessments are useful for the government officials, implementers, decision makers, funding agencies and development experts, to have a common understanding on vulnerability, enabling them to assess which state in IHR is more vulnerable, what has made them vulnerable and how they might address these vulnerabilities. The Framework and the results were presented here today (14th March 2019) during the National Workshop on ‘Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment for States and the Union Territories Using a Common Framework’ organized by IIT Guwahati and IIT Mandi with support from IISc Bengaluru, Department of Science and Technology (DST) and Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). This event was marked by the inauguration of the portal, http://himalayageoportal.in/, dedicated to this vulnerability assessment exercise. The Principle Investigators of the project Dr. Anamika Barua (Associate Professor, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Guwahati), Dr. Shyamasree Dasgupta (Assistant Professor, School of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Mandi) and the Key Resource Person of the project Prof. N. H. Ravindranath, IISc Bengaluru mentioned, “Based on the common methodology, we came up with a state level vulnerability assessment for the IHR and organized training workshops for the state level officials to carry out district level assessments in all 12 IHR states. Such a coordinated approach and enhanced cooperation between states in the IHR and the departments within the states are assumed to improve resilience to climate change because several adaptation interventions will require coordinated efforts across administrative boundaries”. The 12 states include Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim and the hilly districts of West Bengal in the eastern part and Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir in the Western part of IHR. Highlighting the impact of this project, Prof. Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, said, “The adaptation to Climate Change is a collaborative effort between appropriate use of technology, a vision that produces policies, a change at ground level and engaging the local communities. These vulnerability maps will play a crucial role in this effort.”"
  
           
           
" Levi Draheim is an 11-year-old kid who lives on a barrier island separating the coast of Florida from the Atlantic Ocean. He is also a plaintiff in a lawsuit against the US government over climate change. “I don’t even know if the Earth is going to be around when I’m older at the rate that we’re going,” Levi told AFP in a phone interview before his swim class in Indian Harbour Beach, just south of Cape Canaveral. “I really hope when I’m older, if I have kids, that they’ll be able to see where I lived, where I played,” he says. “But I don’t know if I’m even going to be alive or if we’re going to be maybe living on Mars?” Levi is the youngest of 21 plaintiffs in legal action launched in 2015 by two associations, Our Children’s Trust and Earth Guardians, against the US government -- a case now stalled in the courts for years. They accuse federal authorities not only of a failure to act in the face of global warming, but also of “affirmative actions that cause climate change,” including policies that promote fossil fuels. They say such actions will deprive future generations of their constitutional right to life, liberty and property. Their action is separate from but complementary to that kicked off last year by Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg, who sparked weekly school strikes on climate and a global day of action on Friday. Of course, Levi and his group know who Greta is. They’ve even sent her a portrait they made of her. ‘I’m extremely worried’ When you live as Levi does on a sand dune, just 13 feet (less than four meters) above sea level, nature is an everyday fact of life. Levi, who is home schooled, is part of a group of children who have adopted a section of oceanfront beach, cleaning it every week. They joined the lawsuit against the US government when their local minister was contacted by Our Children’s Trust. “I was very interested in the environment and do anything (I can) to help the environment. I knew about climate change, but I didn’t know what I could do to help stop it,” he said. Of course, the fine legal points of the case are a little past Levi: “You would have to ask my mom about legal stuff.” But his tender age does not mean he is any less committed to the cause. “I think about climate change every day, basically,” he says.   "
" The sixth Global Environment Outlook (GEO6) report warns policymakers that current nationally determined contributions (NDC) under Paris Agreement, 2015 are just a third of the mitigation required to keep global temperatures below two degrees over pre-industrial levels. “What this means is that even if we fulfil all the NDCs, the global temperature will still shoot up to 2.7 to 3 degrees Celsius, and with the United States withdrawing from the agreement, it will likely go beyond 3 degrees,” said Dr NH Ravindranath, professor at Centre for Sustainable Technologies at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, and one of the contributors to the global report. Last year, a special report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that an increase of 1.5 degrees over pre-industrial levels would mean heat waves, heavy rainfall, extreme weather conditions, water shortage, reduced farm output, coral bleaching and sea level rise. With a two-degree rise, these risks would increase substantially. At the current pace of rise, the temperature target of 1.5 degrees is likely to be crossed between 2030 and 2052. “The target of 2 degrees is likely to be crossed 10-15 years after that,” said Ravindranath. To arrest the temperature rise well below two degrees, emissions need to drop between 40% and 70% globally between 2010 and 2050, falling to net zero by 2070, according to GEO6 report. “The report presents a global perspective and the same is true for India. The outlook is bleak. What we are saying in the report is that we are not on track to achieve sustainable development goals. We have several global commitments and action plans at the national level but the translation to the local level is weak,” said Ravindranath. The GEO6 report was presented for consideration and endorsement on Wednesday during the ongoing fourth United Nations Environment Assembly in Nairobi, Kenya. The report examines how global environmental degradation has led to irreversible impacts on atmosphere, land, oceans, and biodiversity and these, in turn, have “very high impact” on the health of people. According to it, the world’s population is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050 with 66% of the population living in urban centres by 2050. “To actually reverse the pressure of the human population on the health of the planet we need to think of ways to prevent people from migrating to cities because they are not ready for it. Already, big cities like Bangalore are running out of the water,” said DrRavindranath."
" As the two largest emerging economies, China and India are already at the forefront of economic growth and development. Now, they are becoming global leaders by taking ambitious steps to combat climate change. And by incorporating bold climate action into their economic strategies, they are demonstrating new approaches to growth in the global South. Each country faces unique development challenges, but they also have a lot to learn from each other. Both face more than one million premature deaths per year because of air pollution. Both are trying to address the rising energy demand with renewables and energy efficiency. Both want to spread their growing wealth to a wider percentage of their populations. And both have relatively low carbon emissions on a per capita basis, but are working to limit them as part of their commitment to the Paris Agreement. This means there is fertile ground for collaboration and a coalition of business, academic and think tank organisations are helping to make that happen. For the third year in a row, Tsinghua University, the Indian Council for International Economic Relations, and the New Climate Economy will bring together a group of high-level experts from China and India to discuss development pathways. The meetings alternate between the two countries, and this year, it will take place over 21-23 March in Beijing. The long-term objective is to create a forum where the two countries can exchange insights and identify concrete opportunities for collaboration on low-carbon economic transformation. First, let’s look at climate leadership in China. President Xi Jinping has said China is “taking a driver’s seat in international cooperation to respond to climate change”. Under the Paris Agreement, China pledged to peak its emissions by 2030 at the latest. Experts say it may be on track to do so five years early. China invests more in renewable energy than any other country in the world. It plans to put $360 million into renewable energy from 2016-2020, creating 13 million jobs. It is home to five of the six top solar panel manufacturers and five of the top ten wind turbine makers. The government is also gradually introducing a nationwide carbon emissions trading scheme. While it is a bit behind schedule because of the complexity of the task, when it is in place it will be by far the largest emissions trading system in the world. China is also making progress to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases by switching away from coal burning near cities and investing in public transit. China also accounts for more than half of worldwide electric vehicle sales. Last year it launched the New Energy Vehicle mandate, which sets a quota for how many zero-emissions vehicles automakers must sell. The goal is to have 4.6 million zero-emissions vehicles on the roads by 2020, and phase out traditional combustion engines by 2040. This could remake the global car industry. As a result of its clean energy initiatives, it successfully reduced particulate matter by 6.5% in 338 cities from 2016 to 2017. In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has led from the front and the country is also on track to meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement. India pledged to generate 40% of its electricity from non-fossil fuel sources and reduce its carbon intensity by 33-35% by 2030. The government has several key policies in place that form the basis for its climate and development efforts, including the Perform, Achieve, and Trade scheme, the Clean Environment Cess, and the Energy Conservation Building Code. By continuing and improving on these policies, India can achieve its greenhouse gas emissions goals while maintaining an annual growth of 6-7%. One of the most exciting policies in India is its plan to generate 175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable electricity by 2022. It is well on its way to achieving that goal. Over the past four years, India’s solar energy capacity has increased eightfold. Along with the rapid scaling of its investments, the costs of renewable energy have fallen 50% in two years and it has reached a cost tipping point, where new wind and solar power is now 20% cheaper than existing coal. In a promising sign, the number of planned coal plants went down by a quarter in the first half of 2018. The Indian government expects to overshoot its renewable energy goal and hit 227 GW of capacity by 2022, though independent analysts caution that it may fall short. Commitment is needed to provide policy certainty to renewable investors. Research shows that achieving India’s renewable energy targets would create 330,000 new jobs. These jobs would benefit both semi-skilled and unskilled workers, and could provide an alternative to subsistence farming for the rural poor and especially women. In terms of cleaning up pollution, the Indian government is less far along than China, but it recently took an important first step by setting a five-year target to reduce smog in 102 cities by up to 30%. As of now the target is only aspirational, but with more funding and a clear clean energy implementation effort there could be a big pay off for public health. How China and India approach the transition to a low-carbon economy is a game changer. Looking across the best of their collective experiences, they are leading the way towards a new, inclusive and sustainable growth model. Working together they will go faster and further , providing lessons for the rest of the world.

" Eleven-year-old Nitin is busy painting posters with the message ‘Fridays for Future’, calling upon people to join the Global School Strike against climate change. Over 400 school children from Delhi plan to bunk school and gather at the Central park in Connaught Place on March 15 to strike, demanding their right to breathe. Students aged between 10 and 16 will participate in the strike. At least seven city schools have allowed students to skip school for a few hours for the cause. “We must not cut trees and limit the vehicles exhaust, factories and waste burning, as it makes difficult for children to breathe. The government must not allow felling of trees for making buildings, as we will suffer its effects in the future,” said Nitin, who goes by his first name, a class 6 student at a Delhi government-run school at INA. The protest planned this Friday is part of the strike by school kids across the globe as part of the ‘Extinction Rebellion’ started last year by Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old girl in Sweden. In Gurugram, at least 500 primary and high school students from across schools in the city are likely to stage a protest against the government’s inaction on climate change at the Wazirabad bundh in Sector 53 on Friday. Asheer Kandhari, a 15-year-old class 10 student, said scientists say that 12 years from now, the earth will get warmer by 1.5 degrees posing a threat to human survival. The government must listen to the children now and target reducing the city’s carbon emissions, he said. “A number of birds have gone extinct in Delhi and other species too will if we don’t act now. Preserving wildlife, green areas must be a priority for the government just like providing jobs and housing,” she said. K Sudha, student welfare director at Bloom Public School, Vasant Vihar, said, “We will send students from class 11 to participate in the strike, as exams for other classes are still on. This is legal bunking and we will set aside one day every month for the movement.” The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) report on global warming published in October 2018 stated that global temperatures will rise by 1.5 degrees between 2030 and 2052, which will have devastating effects of ecosystems. Coastal nations and agricultural economies like India would be the worst affected, the report said. “The children’s movement could be a great advocacy initiative just like in Europe. In India, we are already facing climate extremes. We have less than 15 years to curb emissions,” said Chandra Bhushan, deputy director, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). Currently, India contributes 5-6% to the global emissions while the largest contributors are the US and China accounting together for 40-45%."
" The Kochi Biennale is India’s biggest art event. Many artists engaged with environmental issues, but for this column, what’s noteworthy is that it empowers visitors (many well-to-do) to embrace lifestyles different from those back home. I was personally struck by how much people walked. The roads are as lousy as roads in other cities, and pedestrian pavements as non-existent. It was just that not using cars everywhere was the rhythm of the space. Almost no place was air-conditioned. People wore hats and cotton clothes, drank water and enjoyed ceiling fans. The biennale was curated to build a sense of community. You simply cannot make change unless to learn to function as a community. The many kitchens, film screenings, performances, talks and just meeting points became nuclei for community building. Why does a brief dip into a greener topography matter? First, because it is reassuring that this is possible at an event which, in its last edition, was attended by six lakh people. Second, experiencing this even for a weekend builds confidence (in the one who undertakes it) that such a less consumptive life is not a punishment. Third, because it suggests that you need to create the ambience, the possibility and the culture. In this era of severe climate change, such collaterals from India’s best art event offer should set us thinking."
           
           
  
            
             
      
" US president Donald Trump accused Democrats of planning a “socialist nightmare” with their extreme agenda, reeling out an attack line for the 2020 election, and disparaged the Russia meddling probe and former officials in a speech to supporters at an annual convention of a leading conservative body. “We believe in the American dream, not in the socialist nightmare,” the president said at the convention of the Conservative Political Action Committee Saturday, taking aim at specifically at the “Green New Deal” climate strategy. “America will never be a socialist country.” “Socialism is not about the environment, it’s not about justice, it’s not about virtue.” He said it’s about “power for the ruling class.” The attack-line that’s been taking shape in recent weeks was reprised by other speakers at the conventions as well, chiefly, Vice-president Mike Pence, as a new rallying point for their supporters. And it is gaining traction, evident from the thunderous applause Trump got for it. The “Green New Deal”, which is a set of ideas more than a plan, takes a comprehensive, all-in approach to climate change, education, healthcare, job creation and labour laws. It has been endorsed by most Democrats who have either announced they are running for president or plan to. Trump and Republicans have sought to the deal as socialism to keep their flock together and bring back moderate conservatives who seemed to have been driven away by the president’s divisive politics, as was seen in the November mid-term when Democrats won control of the House of Representatives. President Trump has enjoyed speaking at the CPAC convention, and his well-received 2011 address there is widely understood to have kickstarted his foray into politics. On Saturday, he was back, and in his elements. He spoke off-script, and for more than two hours, the lengthiest of his presidency. Trump attacked the ongoing Russia probe for finding nothin, and disparaged Special Counsel Robert Mueller for leading a motivated investigation, mocked his former attorney general Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the investigations and attacked Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general for starting the probe."
" A combination of factors, including extreme weather events stemming from climate change, habitat fragmentation and unregulated fishing, has placed many of the endemic fish species in the river Cauvery, which flows through Karnataka, Kerala, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu, at the risk of extinction, researchers say. The fish at risk include the various mahseer species found in the river, including the giant hump-backed mahseer (Tor remadevii), which can grow up to 1.5 metres in length and weigh 55 kilograms. It is considered one of the 20 mega fish of the world. Other fish species such as the red-tipped halfbeak, the slender stone loach, the mrigal, the Wayanad mahseer, the Korhi barb, the Nilgiri barb, the Nilgiri mystus, the Bhavani barb, the Cauvery barb, and the Nemacheilus pulchellus (which is so rare it doesn’t have a common name) are at risk of extinction as well. “The Cauvery is subject to an intense range of anthropogenic impacts which act either independently or in combination to threaten the existence of fish populations and all aquatic flora and fauna,” Adrian Pinder, a fisheries scientist at Bournemouth University in England and director of research at the UK-based Mahseer Trust said in an emailed response to queries from HT . “These include pollution, habitat destruction and blocked migration pathways, overfishing using illegal methods such as dynamite and poison, and alien species which are generally stocked intentionally by the fisheries departments.” For example, the hump-backed mahseer was once found throughout the Cauvery, but today its distribution and population have declined by more than 90%, according to Pinder. The species was recently assessed as being critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Pinder added: “This fish is considered an umbrella species. If it is present, then we know that the water quality habitat and migratory pathways are good. Today we are aware of only two small spawning populations, both sited within tributaries of the main river Cauvery.” Unlike large mammals or marine life, there are no dedicated protected areas for India’s freshwater fish species. In the Western Ghats, some 50 % of endemic fish species are threatened with extinction although the region is considered one of only two biodiversity hotspots in India, researchers say. “Fish are not even considered as wildlife and protection is only restricted to the existing wildlife sanctuaries and national parks,” said Rajeev Raghavan, South Asia coordinator for the IUCN’s freshwater fish specialist group and an assistant professor at the Kerala University for Fisheries and Ocean studies (KUFOS). Unlike the habitat of large mammals, the habitat of a fish species can spread across both protected and so-called ‘non-protected’ areas of the river and its tributaries. Raghavan added: “Most endemic fish in the Cauvery is found in its upper reaches – places like Coorg, in the Cauvery’s tributaries such as the river Moyar, Bhavani and Kabini. The area from Shivasamudram to Hogenekkal also harbours populations of endemic and threatened species. The fish are mostly microhabitat specialists, restricted to specific areas of the river.” Scientists say awareness creation among local communities and officials is essential to stave off the spectre of extinction of the Cauvery fish species."
" The wave of the first social media challenge of 2019, the #10yearchallenge, that went viral with celebs sharing their ‘then and now’ pictures may be over. However, a few celebs have shown that it’s never too late to spark a trend that starts a dialogue on issues pertaining to climate change and environment. Take, for instance, film director and writer Homi Adajania, who posted about the #100yearchallenge alongside a picture urging followers to cut down on the use of plastic. “I had made an Insta video against polluting and killing our oceans. It was shared by several celebrities, who reposted it helped to spread awareness across over 30 lakh viewers across Instagram,” he says.   Thank goodness I switched to bamboo toothbrush with cornstarch bristles! Have you? #10yearchallenge A post shared by Dia Mirza (@diamirzaofficial) on Jan 19, 2019 at 9:24pm PST So, when a celebrity talks about an environmental issue, does it help to create a bigger impact on the masses? Actor Dia Mirza, who has been associated with environmental issues and is also an UN Environment Goodwill Ambassador, says, “Celebrities have proven to be an effective tool of communication for improving environmental awareness. Several of the campaigns that we have been working on have been supported by global ambassadors and have managed to influence lifestyle change and encouraged policy making.” Actor Juhi Chawla, who also posted her take on the #10yearchallenge to spread awareness on the same, says, “I am sincerely hoping that when a celeb does make a statement, people listen. I know when other celebs put their face to the campaign, it catches my eye.”   #10yearchallenge A post shared by Juhi Chawla (@iamjuhichawla) on Jan 17, 2019 at 1:28am PST And probably that is why stars have decided to lead by example. Chawla feels small habits and choices can go a long way — she uses a bamboo toothbrush, and has got glass/steel/ceramic jars and steel/copper/glass bottles instead of their plastic counterparts. “Switching to biodegradable napkins, carrying my own water bottle, refusing to buy food packaged in plastic/styrofoam” are some of the habits Dia Mirza has opted for. Even Adajania has made sure that his film shoots have a big plastic reduction policy where they try and use several alternatives on a daily basis."
" The Arctic Ocean could experience ice-free summers within the next 20 years -- much earlier than previously predicted -- unless human greenhouse gas emissions are greatly reduced, a study warns. Computer models predict climate change will cause the Arctic to be nearly free of sea ice during the summer by the middle of this century, due to a natural, long-term warming phase in the tropical Pacific, in addition to the human-caused warming. However, a closer examination of long-term temperature cycles in the tropical Pacific points towards an ice-free Arctic in September, the month with the least sea ice, on the earlier side of forecasts, according to the research published in the AGU journal Geophysical Research Letters. “The trajectory is towards becoming ice-free in the summer but there is uncertainty as to when that’s going to occur,” said James Screen, an associate professor at the University of Exeter in the UK. There are different climate models used by researchers to predict when the first ice-free Arctic September will occur. Most models project there will fewer than one million square kilometers of sea ice around the middle of this century, but projections of when that will occur vary within 20-year windows due to natural climate fluctuations. The climate model used in the new study predicts an ice-free Arctic summer sometime between 2030 and 2050, if greenhouse gases continue to rise. By accounting for a long-term warming phase in the tropical Pacific, the new research shows an ice-free Arctic is more likely to occur on the earlier side of that window, closer to 2030 than 2050. Ocean temperatures in the Pacific always vary from month-to-month and from year-to-year, but slowly evolving ocean processes cause long-term temperature shifts lasting between 10 and 30 years. These shifts in temperature, known as the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), translate into an approximately 0.5 degree Celsius shift in ocean surface temperature in the tropics over the 10- to 30-year cycle. Around five years ago, the Pacific began to switch from the cold to warm phase of the IPO. Screen and his co-author plotted predictions of when an ice-free Arctic would occur in model experiments where the IPO was shifting in the same direction as the real world. They compared these to predictions where the IPO was moving in the opposite direction, that is, switching from a warm to cold phase. They found model predictions that were in sync with actual conditions showed an earlier ice-free Arctic, by seven years on average, than those predictions that were out of step with reality. Screen says these results need to be interpreted as part of a bigger picture. Human-caused climate change is the main reason for sea ice loss, so the timing of the first ice-free summer will also depend considerably on whether greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise or are curtailed."
              
       
                              
              
                    
" Swine flu, caused by the H1N1 virus, has killed 17 people and infected more than 280 people in Maharashtra since the beginning of the year. Disease experts said the unusually cold winter conditions in the state since January have been a major reason for its spreading. Seven patients across the state are currently on life support due to respiratory infection. Of the total deaths this year, 13 (76%) happened over the first week of February; in the same period, 191 infections (68% of the total) were reported — indicating its rapid spread. Seven swine-flu cases were reported in Mumbai since January 1 but there have been no deaths so far. State surveillance officer Dr P Awate pointed to the cold wave over north and central India making it favourable for the virus to spread. “Most of the deaths are reported from Nagpur, Pune and Nashik and inland areas, which are colder than coastal districts such as Mumbai or Konkan,” he said. The India Meteorological Department has attributed the climate change to western disturbances combining with upper air cyclonic circulation over north-western regions of the country. According to several studies, H1N1 virus spreads faster in colder weather conditions because they harden its surface, helping it survive for longer periods. Once the virus settles in the nasal passageways of humans, it adapts to the climate and attacks when the body’s immunity falls (which happens at colder temperatures). As a result, the number of swine flu cases and deaths have spiked across northern and western states this year. According to data from the health ministry, Rajasthan has reported 3,359 cases and 126 deaths; Gujarat has reported 1,187 cases and 54 deaths; and Punjab, 301 cases and 30 deaths. States such as Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana and Delhi are also reeling under the outbreak of swine flu. In Maharashtra, Awate said health officials have planned a large-scale vaccination against swine flu, especially to protect vulnerable groups such as children, pregnant women, patients with hypertension, health care workers and senior citizens. “More than 1.25 lakh vaccines will be administered in April and May,” he said. To avoid delays in diagnosis, disease experts have advised doctors to look out for patients showing atypical symptoms. “If the infection is diagnosed early, it is relatively easier to treat. People must avoid self-medication, as swine flu shares many symptoms with common flu,” said Dr Om Srivastava, Director, infectious diseases department, Jaslok Hospital. Srivastava said the number of swine flu patients in the state is likely to increase but it would not be anywhere close to the 2009 pandemic, which saw 937 deaths and 9,943 cases. “Climate change may be the contributing factor but certainly not the only cause of the national spread of the virus,” he said. Srivastava said an antigenic shift (multiple H1N1 virus strains combining to form a new subtype) or antigenic drift (mutation within virus genes) may also be behind the high number of deaths this year. “But detailed studies would be necessary to prove it,” he said."
          
                     
          
  
           
            
" A comprehensive assessment of the Hindu-Kush Himalaya (HKH) region by Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) has said that a 1.5°C rise in global temperature over pre-industrial levels will spell doom for the fragile ecology of the region. The report, which deals with climate change, biodiversity, energy, cryosphere (frozen water), water, food security, air pollution, disaster and resilience, poverty, adaptation, and gender and migration, is significant because the HKH region covers 4.2 million square km across Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan. The region is home to 10 major river basins and four of 36 global biodiversity hot spots. Nearly 1.65 billion people living in the downstream areas of these river basins benefit directly and indirectly from its resources, says the report. The region directly sustains the livelihood of 240 million people living in the Himalayan region. “This is the climate crisis you haven’t heard of,” said Philippus Wester of ICIMOD, who led the assessment. “Global warming is on track to transform the frigid mountain peaks to bare rocks in a little less than a century. It’s the projected reductions in pre-monsoon river flows and changes in monsoon that will hit hardest,” he added. The report is alarming and calls for serious introspection by the eight countries because this transboundary problem must have transboundary solutions."
" Jamir Shaikh Munir, 28, secured 18th rank in Indian Forest Service (IFS) 2019 and topped in Maharashtra. Hailing from Shirur in Pune district, Munir did his early studies in Delhi before moving to Bengaluru in 2016. Speaking to Nadeem Inamdar, the civil services exam topper shares his success story How did you prepare for the exam? As this was my fifth attempt, my base for exam was clear so I could clear prelim easily. And I had an experience of this exam where I reached the interview stage, so I focussed more on my optional subjects and worked on English like basic grammar rules and formats of essay and letter writing. It is a scoring subject so one must take it seriously which I missed in my first serious attempt of 2016. For the interview, I did mirror practice mostly and gave only one mock interview in Delhi. My senior, Santosh sir, helped me in the optional subject. I kept my focus on IFS exam only. So, I was confident about positive result this year. What other steps are needed during studying? Keep yourself happy and energetic. Be optimistic always because the exam is difficult, so patience and positive attitude will help to overcome failures and come out with shining results. Keep targets small and complete them with utter discipline. The exam is simple, but the process is tedious. So, it becomes hard to crack easily, but discipline and hard work can pay you off at the end. Why this particular exam?"
" Climate change will begin altering water levels in the Ganga and the Brahmaputra in the next three decades, and after 2050, the rivers could record an abrupt decrease in flow, according to a study on the Hindu Kush and Himalayan (HKH) region that predicts disruptions which could jeopardise agriculture and access to drinking water. The findings are part of the 600-page report from Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), which includes 210 authors who studied the ecology of the Hindu Kush and Himalayan region. The report, released on Monday, predicts that a third of glaciers in the HKH region will thaw if average global temperatures rise by 1.5°C. For the Ganga, Brahmaputra and Indus, the report adds that water flow will gradually rise till 2050 before they start to plummet. This, the assessment adds, will consequently diminish the water available for drinking, irrigating farms, and producing electricity for roughly 250 million people living downstream. “Although increases in meltwater are likely for the next few decades, melt water volume is likely to decrease abruptly once glacial storage is reduced,” the assessment said. Glacial storage refers to the amount of ice buildup that will turn into meltwater. The impact will be most pronounced in the upper reaches.   River flow in the plains are also influenced by rains. The report warns that these predictions are based on an assumption of 1.5°C warming — a level the United Nations’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change believes will be hit in early 2040s — and if the warming is more, the consequences will be higher. Two-thirds of the ice could vanish if governments fail to rein in greenhouse gas emissions this century, the report says. According to an expert, the link between glacial melt with river flow depends on several factors. “Whether glacial retreat is going to contribute to increase in meltwater depends on the nature of retreat… Glacial melt is not directly proportional to increase in meltwater in rivers. The assessment is based on climate modelling… (but) it’s true that chances of glacial lake outbursts floods (GLOF) is high with temperature rise,” said AL Ramanathan, professor of environmental geology and glaciology laboratory, school of environmental sciences at JNU. Authors and researchers involved in the study have recommended that the entire HKH region, including parts of India, remain engaged with the “loss and damage” process in climate negotiations. Loss and damage refers to an effort in the annual climate negotiations to create a legal framework where vulnerable countries can be compensated for losses due to climate change."
         
" On January 26, India entered its 70th year as a republic. With our economic and geographical size, and our young population, India shoulders a great responsibility to our citizens and to the world. In this, science has a key role to play. Today, our planet is in a perilous state. Our route to this precipice started at least a century before 1950. Industrial revolutions and their consequent growth pulled hundreds of millions into the middle class, first in the West, and later, elsewhere. Some analysts have pointed out that health benefits, education, assured food and housing are available to more people now than ever before. In India, primary health and vaccination programmes, education, the green revolution, and liberalisation have moved us from a near-static economy to the world’s fastest growing one. However, the way we, on earth, have grown, has caused climate change, consequent global warming, and major environmental degradation. The development of new technologies leading up to, and including, the fourth industrial revolution have also greatly sharpened inequalities, concentrating extraordinary wealth and power in the hands of a global elite. If we are to retrieve our planet, we need to address these prevalent threats as well as emerging ones. This needs to be done while satisfying the legitimate demand to take all our people out of poverty. Success requires a new route and meaning to growth. Here, science in India can define this new approach and shape it. The most important role for our scientists today is in the training of the next generation to make critical thinking second nature and research commonplace. Our best science and technology research environments cater to less than 5% of our students. Quality research, driven by the search for knowledge understanding, must also be done in our state universities, which cater to 95% of our students, and where first generation students enter in the millions. Tomorrow’s global elite will have the exploitative power, not only from material resources, but mainly from the ability to use data. A poorly educated workforce will make India a vassal state, with our rich data parked elsewhere and our population impoverished by the lack of understanding and control over its use. Mathematics, statistics and data science, along with computer science, need to be added to foundational skilling, through language-neutral teaching material accessible in quality across our geographies. Our best scientists and science institutions are fully up to this task of expanding the footprint of research and excellence. Over the past two decades, the median quality of our researchers has gone up noticeably. From theoretical physics and mathematics to cell biology and health research, more Indians are globally noticed. Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay and Ritabrata Munshi in computer science and mathematics are examples as are Upinder Bhalla, Yamuna Krishnan and Rohini Godbole in neuroscience, chemical-biology and high-energy physics respectively. Yet these, and many other such scientists come mainly from a handful of institutions. These institutions must now lead in the expansion of quality, so that there are more of them. Our best researchers must be more daring in the questions they themselves address, thinking with more originality and ambition. Currently, with some notable and admirable exceptions, such as the ones named above, our excellent scientists and institutions aspire, at most, to be as good as those elsewhere. While this does not seem a bad goal, it destines us to be followers of moving targets set by others. We should simply aim to address and solve the most challenging problems, fundamental or applied, national or global. If we do this, we can be better than the best in many ways, while others are the best in their own ways. If we focus on trying to be the best by imitation, we may be very good by global metrics but very boring, unimaginative and without national and global impact. Our best will be admired for their ability to fit in and serve imaginative leaders from elsewhere, but rarely for our ability to break new paths. Our scientific ambitions can and must be diverse, from abstract mathematics to cosmology, and everything basic and applied, in between. Our major sites of investment in intellectual power, Bengaluru, Pune, Hyderabad etc can leap ahead if they form hubs in each city that link to develop spokes elsewhere, locally or thematically. In past decades, the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) have been playing nationally transformative roles. Today, these and other institutions must be ambitious again. They have the leadership to do so. The IISc, for example, can and must form a confederation of major institutions in Bengaluru, which keeps intact and enhances their best features and autonomy but links them inexorably in teaching, research collaborations and ambitious projects. This can be done in other cities too, led by each major institution there. Such clusters have been articulated top down in the past few years. But our great scientists and science leaders need to demonstrate bottom-up hunger too. The population of Bengaluru is comparable to that of the Netherlands. With leadership from the IISc and partnerships from the best institutions in Bengaluru, the IT-Biotech engines, the labs of ISRO, DRDO, CSIR, IARI etc., magic can be worked. And, while doing so, this cluster can help transform our state universities. India can grow rapidly in a sustainable manner. For this to become reality, our leading scientists and institutions need to combine their competence with a comprehension that moves us to firmly address big issues intelligently. With courage and original thinking, a science powerhouse that is different, but as remarkable as those in the UK, Netherlands or Sweden, can bloom in every major hub. This can actively stimulate the spread of a research culture among our students in the spokes. The creation of such a culture is our primary investment for progress and the only insurance against the vagaries of the future.

" A new assessment of the Hindu-Kush Himalaya (HKH) region shows a 1.5°C rise in global temperature over pre-industrial levels will spell doom for fragile ecology of the region. Such degree of warming is likely to lead to melting or severe retreat of one-third of the region’s glaciers, the study commissioned by Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) said on Monday. HKH region covers Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan and is home to Mount Everest, K2 and other significant peaks. The glaciers here feed rivers including the Ganges, Indus, Yellow, Mekong and Irrawaddy. The assessment states glaciers in the HKH show mass loss since at least 1970s. But results from in situ measurements show the predominant mass loss happened during the last five decades, particularly since 1995. “The greatest rates of mass loss in the extended HKH post 2000 are found in the eastern and western Himalaya. Moderate losses are observed in the central Himalaya, and the Hindu Kush. In contrast, glaciers in the Karakoram showed neutral mass balances or even slight mass gains after 2000,” the assessment said. If global climate efforts fail, the study warns that current emissions would lead to five degrees in warming and a loss of two-thirds of the region’s glaciers by 2100. “This is the climate crisis you haven’t heard of,” said Philippus Wester of ICIMOD, who led the assessment. “Global warming is on track to transform the frigid mountain peaks to bare rocks in a little less than a century. It’s the projected reductions in pre-monsoon river flows and changes in monsoon that will hit hardest,” he added."
" The traditional Indian thali now seems to have pride of place on the global table. At least, that’s what recent research and trends, particularly in the West, indicate. As virtuous veganism becomes a value in places like North America, the organic aisles of supermarkets are now cluttered with brands with names like Prana or Guru. Studies and policy in recent times is driving this hunger for change. For instance, a recent study published in the journal Lancet called for cutting consumption of meat and sugar by half by 2050. Its findings gave rise to headlines like, Lentils with a side of rice: The save-the-world diet? As many pointed out, the humble daal-chawal has been a staple of Indian meals for centuries. Canada’s updated Food Guide for 2019 also considers the daal the real deal, as well as dahi, the yoghurt that has also accompanied countless repasts in India. While turmeric emerged as a superfood during this millennium, even other constants such as ghee, derided for decades as unhealthy, has turned a favourite, available in flavours like Maple Chai or Himalayan Pink Salt, not to mention spreads like chocolate ghee. If there’s a push towards adoption of this regimen, that may turn into a shove soon enough. As climate change science becomes more imbued into global culture, and warns of a looming, if not already present, crisis, the old Meat is Murder paradigm is making a comeback, with a vengeance. The connection is obvious, with evidence that the process of meat production in its entirety, could contribute to nearly 20 per cent of global warming. Expect temperatures to rise over how to combat this portion of the challenge. So, we may well be headed towards a phase of militancy where there is a radical espousal of meatlessness. Protests outside restaurants are already common, though not of the sort of violent vigilantism that’s been witnessed in India in recent years. Researchers are already making the connection between meat eating and climate change. Among the authors of the Lancet study, in fact, was the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Change Impact Research. Therefore, for non-vegetarians like me, the meals that we have taken for granted could soon enough morph into a guilty pleasure, as conscientious objectors will certainly turn more strident in trying to ruin our appetites. Ironically enough, these attitudes will filter back into India, a country where food customs have been ecologically okay, given the absence of intensive ranching and industrial-scale cattle ranches. That may even partly be a positive as urban India increasingly gives in to imported junk, as chains push stuff like Diwali donuts and paneer pizzas. Most experts in dietary habits will point out that eating anything in moderation ought not to be a concern. But in these times of schism, moderation is unlikely to be the manner in which this cultural shift is shoved upon us. A food fight is coming, and we need to be prepared for it.

" Frostbite inducing cold in America, severe heat in Australia and heavy snowfall in the Alps and the Himalayas marked an unusually extreme January, the World Meteorological Organisation has said The cold In North America Dangerous cold and heavy snow crippled the northern US this week, killing more than two dozen people and frostbite, broken bones, heart attacks and carbon monoxide poisoning leaving hundreds injured The cold was caused by an influx of Arctic air, with wind chill factors making temperatures outdoors as cold as -53.9 degrees Celsius in southern Minnesota, which can cause frostbite -- the condition in which tissues freeze --within minutes The frigid winds were a result of a mix of climatic conditions, all of which are being seen by experts as a consequence of climate change.   Himalayas and Alps hit too Indian weather officials issued warnings of heavy or very heavy rain and snow for Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, prompting warnings of avalanches amid an intense cold wave.

" NASA scientists have discovered a gigantic cavity, almost 300 metres tall, growing at the bottom of the Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica, indicating rapid decay of the ice sheet and acceleration in global sea levels due to climate change. The findings, published in the journal Science Advances, highlight the need for detailed observations of Antarctic glaciers’ undersides in calculating how fast sea levels will rise in response to warming. Researchers expected to find some gaps between ice and bedrock at Thwaites’ bottom where ocean water could flow in and melt the glacier from below, NASA said in a statement. The size and explosive growth rate of the newfound hole, however, surprised them. It is big enough to have contained 14 billion tonnes of ice, and most of that ice melted over the last three years. “We have suspected for years that Thwaites was not tightly attached to the bedrock beneath it,” said Eric Rignot of the University of California, Irvine in the US. “Thanks to a new generation of satellites, we can finally see the detail,” said Rignot, who is also associated with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The cavity was revealed by ice-penetrating radar in NASA’s Operation IceBridge, an airborne campaign beginning in 2010 that studies connections between the polar regions and the global climate. The researchers also used data from a constellation of Italian and German space-borne synthetic aperture radars. These very high-resolution data can be processed by a technique called radar interferometry to reveal how the ground surface below has moved between images. “(The size of) a cavity under a glacier plays an important role in melting. As more heat and water get under the glacier, it melts faster,” said Pietro Milillo of JPL. Thwaites Glacier is currently responsible for about four per cent of global sea level rise, researchers said. It holds enough ice to raise the world ocean a little over 65 centimeters and backstops neighbouring glaciers that would raise sea levels an additional 2.4 metres if all the ice were lost, they said. “We are discovering different mechanisms of retreat,” Millilo said. Different processes at various parts of the 160-kilometer-long front of the glacier are putting the rates of grounding-line retreat and of ice loss out of sync, NASA said.      "
" December 2018 was the third coldest December in the last decade with an average minimum temperature of the whole month recorded 11.9 degrees Celsius because of cold wave like condition which prevailed during the month, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) data.   According to data shared by IMD, December 2013 was recorded as the coldest month with 11.1 degrees Celsius average minimum monthly temperature. It was followed by December 2016 in which the average minimum monthly temperature was recorded at 11.6 degree Celsius. December 2018 stood third in this rank with 11.9 degree Celsius of average minimum monthly temperature.   The data further revealed that December 29, has recorded decades lowest minimum temperature at 5.9 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature of December went below 7.4 degrees Celsius only three times in the last decade.6.5 degrees Celsius on December 20, 2010, it recorded 6.8-degree Celsius on December 14, 2013, and 6.6-degree Celsius on December 26, 2015.   IMD officials attributed this as a part of climate changes. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather at IMD, Pune, said “Firstly, the month of December usually is cold. As far as this year is concerned, the presence of anticyclone activity towards north-west part of India is responsible for this. Secondly, Presence of northerly wind component associated with western disturbances is one of the important reason behind the cold month.”   Elaborating further Kashyapi, further informed that, the presence of Jet Streams in upper air with a partial tilt towards southern side as compared to normal position and presence of left westerlies were among the prominent reasons behind the drop in the temperature.

" It comes as no surprise that the Lancet Commission authors believe that India is suffering from a “global syndemic” of obesity, undernutrition and climate change and that each condition is going to exacerbate the other in future. Here is why: most Indian cities are reeling under heat stress. The India Meteorological Department (IMD), in its ‘Statement on Climate of India 2018,’ said the annual mean temperature has been recording a perceptible spike since 2000. Eleven out of the 15 warmest years that have been recorded occurred between 2004 and 2018. The authors of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC’s) ‘Global Warming of 1.5 degrees’ report said Indian cities are going to experience severe heat wave and air pollution levels with a 1.5 degree Celsius rise in average mean temperature. “Without considering adaptation options, such as cooling from more reflective roofs, and overall characteristics of urban agglomerations in terms of land use, zoning and building codes, at 2°C warming, Karachi and Kolkata could expect annual conditions equivalent to the deadly 2015 heat waves,” said a chapter in the 1.5 degree report. The Lancet Commission report states that heat stress is going to affect physical activity outdoors. Increased temperature and freak weather events will also reduce nutritional value of crops and reduce agricultural productivity. An Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) study said one-fifth of Indian districts are already susceptible to climate change impacts. The Forest Survey of India (FSI) data shows Indian cities have an abysmally low per capita green cover. In Delhi, for example, the per capita tree availability is 0.3 — less than one tree per person. Besides, the air pollution is severe. Health experts recommend against strenuous physical activity outdoors during periods in which air pollution spikes. These conditions assessed together certainly reflect why climate change may be fuelling obesity. Solutions as recommended by the Lancet Commission lie in tackling the three pandemics together. The Lancet Commission has also highlighted how big food corporations are selling energy-dense but nutrient-poor food with cheap ingredients like refined sugar, flour and oil. This is particularly true for low- and middle-income (LMICs) countries like India. For example, the Lancet report states that policies that offer a “counterweight to the enormous commercial investments focused on promoting sales of obesogenic products and opposing public policies for healthier food environments,” is needed in countries like India. A fizzy drink giant intends to invest more than $10 billion to promote business growth in India, China, and the Philippines alone, the report states. A quick web search on junk food consumption in India’s villages throws up several research studies on how unhealthy fat and snacks allay hunger in low socio-economic neighbourhoods."
" Early this year, Oxfam reported that the richest 10% of India’s population owns 73% of its wealth. As the graph of earnings of the rich climbed, and as the residence of the richest Indian was aiming at the sky, the poorest half of Indians was struggling, with a mere 1% growth. It is in the backdrop of this glaring disparity, that we have to read Robbie Andrew’s (CICERO Center for International Climate Research, Norway) comment that India’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions grew by an estimated 4.6% in 2017, despite it being a turbulent year for its economy. India’s emissions are low at 1.8 tonnes of CO2 per capita, compared to the world average of 4.2 tonnes, but it is a growing economy with an increasingly urbanising population. Andrew makes an interesting observation that demonetisation and the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) had noticeable effects on the economy and, therefore, on emissions, in the first eight months of 2017. Two contributing factors to this decline were the reduction in the consumption of petroleum products and the decline in cement production. As one of the world’s largest economies, China ranks the highest in CO2 production. It is also the world leader in the fight against climate change, through its energy efficient green buildings and technological innovations and adaptations. According to China’s official news agency, its carbon intensity fell 5.1% in 2017 compared to the previous year. Its plans include commissioning eight large scale, carbon capture storage facilities, following the “Climate Works”, a Switzerland-based company that works on technologies for carbon footprint reduction. Their commercial plant, the first in the world, established in Hinwil was commissioned in May 2017. The plant removes 900 tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere each year by passing it through a proprietary filter. This gas is then fed to nearby greenhouses with 20% increase in the yield of crops such as lettuce. India was ranked as the third highest CO2 emitter in the world in 2015 after China and the US by the International Energy Agency. It has pledged under the Paris Agreement to reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by 33-35% by 2030. As a leading destination for private sector players in clean technology sectors, India is committed to achieve the renewable energy commitments made for the Paris Agreement, having created a 13-gigawatt-plus market for solar energy and the fourth largest wind power market in the world. However, if India is to lead climate change initiatives, it has to make more investments in technologies such as carbon capture. Developed nations are discussing several strategies for reducing carbon. These include higher efficiency at the coal-fired power plants, expanding the use of wind, solar, or other low/zero emitting alternatives, increasing energy efficiency in homes and businesses, and more. Steps suggested at the societal and individual levels are lifestyle related- energy efficient homes, solid waste reduction/recycling, choice transportation etc. Of course all this points to a sustainable style of living for generations to come. One of my favourite definitions of sustainability is: “Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” (Our Common Future, a Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development). A few years ago, an elderly friend of mine, who lives in a plush area in Delhi, stayed at my home in Bangalore. Her stay at Bangalore was to relive two sights that she loves most: a starry night and a blue sky. Still possible to do both in Bangalore, perhaps not as spectacularly as she must have done in her youth. I asked her what our grandchildren would do and she replied sadly, “They will never miss this, as they would not have a chance to see them in the first place.” We have already compromised a lot on the prospects of the future generations to live in a healthy environment, to be able to breathe good air and drink pure water, or watch blue skies and starry nights. As political parties wrestle for power, let this be a pledge, an obligation to posterity: a clean and healthy environment.

" The Davos elite say they are more worried than ever about climate change. But that isn’t stopping them chartering private jets in record numbers. The convenience and comfort of flying privately rather than commercially appears to outweigh any concerns about the outsized carbon footprint it involves, judging by a number-crunching exercise by the company Air Charter Service (ACS). It forecast nearly 1,500 private jet flights over the week of the World Economic Forum (WEF) to airports near Davos in the Swiss Alps. That would be up from the more than 1,300 aircraft movements seen at last year’s forum, despite climate change registering as the top risk factor identified for the global economy in a survey of WEF movers and shakers last week. In a blog post, the website privatefly.com forecast an even higher number of private flight movements related to Davos this week, of around 2,000 in and out of local airports. And while most people reach Davos by car or train after alighting from airports such as Zurich, two to three hours’ away, a select few CEOs and government leaders hire helicopters to save time. Demand for private jets in the week of Davos far outstrips other events that also loom large on the private aviation calendar, such as the Super Bowl or Champions’ League final, according to Andy Christie, private jets director at ACS. “We have had bookings from as far as our operations in Hong Kong, India and the US -- no other event has the same global appeal,” he said in a statement And the trend is towards even more expensive, larger private jets such as the Gulfstream GV and Bombardier’s Global Express.

" Thousands of school children and university students across Switzerland skipped class on Friday to march in the streets and demand climate action, telling politicians “There is no planet B”. Despite vows from a number of school districts to show zero tolerance for those who missed class, pupils as young as 12 turned out across at least 15 Swiss cities and towns for the “climate strike.” The protest was inspired by Greta Thunberg, a 15-year-old Swedish girl who since last August has been ditching school each Friday to protest in front of Sweden’s parliament demanding concrete action from politicians to halt climate change. After she garnered international headlines with a fiery speech before world leaders at last month’s COP24 climate talks in Poland, thousands of students have followed in her footsteps, staging “climate strikes” in several countries, including Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Japan and the United States. The strike in Switzerland kicked off Friday morning in Lausanne, where more than 8,000 young people marched through the streets, local police said. Another estimated 4,000 marched across Geneva later on, ending up in front of the United Nations’ European headquarters. “I am demonstrating so that we can give ourselves and our children a future. We are the ones who are the most affected, we are the ones who will be alive in 30, 40, 50 years,” 19-year-old Alexandre Huggel told AFP. “If we don’t act now, if we don’t start taking measures (against climate change) we will run into a brick wall.” ‘Planet hotter than my boyfriend’ The youths used humour and word-play to get their message across, with protesters in Geneva brandishing homemade cardboard signs with statements like: “If the climate was a bank, it would have been rescued already” and “The planet is hotter than my boyfriend”. “System change, not climate change,” read a placard in Zurich, while protesters in Lausanne warned that “The oceans are rising up, and so are we”. One poster spotted in Neuchatel meanwhile urged “Make love, not CO2”. The huge turnout came despite the fact that a number of Swiss cantons, like Wallis and St Gallen, warned they would penalise students who missed class to protest. Geneva meanwhile authorised students to take several hours off to join the protests, although for minors it required parents to sign permission slips."
          
                   
                   
                 
         
          
          
           
" A knitting movement called ‘The Tempestry Project’ in the US has captured how climate change is impacting the planet, bringing the crisis up close even as the Trump administration has played down the issue at various fora, besides threatening to withdraw from the 2015 Paris Agreement. Marissa Connelly, co-founder of the project, wove three tapestries with weather data from the US government-run National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to show how winters were becoming warmer for Utqiagvik in northern Alaska. She knitted scarves with weather data for 1925, 2010 and 2016 for Utqiagvik. In 1925, the city recorded the lowest temperature of the year at -46 degrees Fahrenheit. In 2010, the lowest temperature recorded was -30 degrees F while in 2016, it was only -14 degrees F. Also read: India must climate-proof its rural and urban infrastructure This is how it works: the Tempestry founders choose the yarn and their colours besides developing datasets for their knitting kits. These kits are made for every state in the US besides 20 other countries, which have shown interest in the project. The idea is: one could choose to knit the colours for any year dating back to 1900s and knit another for a recent year to see how weather patterns have changed in a century. Another option is that people can choose a certain year [the birth year of the loved one] and compare their scarves to see how climate change is affecting temperature patterns over years. Also read: Developers go green with sustainable design, tech in commercial buildings Two such tapestries have been knitted for India’s Leh, capturing the weather data for 2009 and 2017. In 2009, Leh in Jammu and Kashmir recorded the hottest day at 51.8 degrees F and the coldest day saw the mercury plummet to -4 degrees F. In 2017, the highest and lowest temperatures were 53.6 and -7.6 degrees F, respectively. “We started working on the project as a direct result of the Trump administration’s refusal to act on climate change..,” Justin Connelly, one of the co-founders, told HT over an email. In 2017, Marissa along with Justin, a data enthusiast, and Emily McNeil, who came from a fibre arts background launched the visual project.

" Santanu Manna, a senior birder based in Bengal, was apprehensive when a fellow birder told him in December 2013 that a single specimen of a migratory insectivorous specie found in the semi-desert regions of Pakistan, central Asia and northeast Africa had been spotted at Rajarhat, an upscale township in the eastern outskirts of Kolkata. “The visitor turned out to be a Desert wheatear of the eastern variety. It was fearless and made no attempt to fly even as I clicked it from close distance,” said Manna, member of Bird Watchers’ Society and a coordinator for eBird India, the online archive of Bird Count India, a platform for organisations and groups monitoring movements and habitats of local and migratory species. “While on a trek to Sandakphu peak in north Bengal in 2017, Biresh Basak, a birder, photographed a Red-tailed wheatear, a tiny member of the flycatcher family found in the mountains of south-west and central Asia. Also called Persian wheatear and Afghan wheatear, the bird was never spotted in Bengal earlier,” said Manna. While the Wheatears – none of these were seen again - continue to baffle nature lovers, experts say several species not seen before in the state have been spotted in the last five years in rural Bengal as well as Kolkata and its adjoining areas. On the other hand, certain species spotted and documented earlier can no longer be seen. Interestingly, the little Wheatears seem to have challenged the knowledge experts have gathered on their flight paths. “Birds arriving in Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka during winter fly down from central Asia and follow the Eastern Flyway. Birds following the Western Flyway come from Ladakh and Karakoram Range and rest in Gujarat and Rajasthan. The birds don’t cross each other’s path,” said Dr Kaushik Deuti, a scientist with Zoological Survey of India (ZSI). Developed by the British in the 1920s and rebuilt into a manicured garden by Bengal’s Trinamool government, Rabindra Sarobar, or the Dhakuria Lakes in the heart of the concrete jungle in south Kolkata is also witnessing new visitors and losing old ones. In and around the 192 acres of artificial lakes and greenery comprising around 7,000 trees, more than 112 species of resident and migratory birds have been sighted since 2015. “Some of the varieties I have caught on camera at Rabindra Sarobar are White-tailed robin, Crow-billed drongo, Ferruginous flycatcher, Ultramarine flycatcher, Slaty-backed flycatcher and Firethroat. Sad part is, most birds of the Thrush family disappeared after firecrackers were used at random by revelers inside the protected area during Chhat puja in November, “ said Sudip Ghosh, who organised a group of birders in 2015 and started cataloguing every sighting. Highly active on social media, the group, Bio-diversity of Rabindra Sarobar now has close to 3000 members. “A single reason cannot be attributed to these unexpected sightings. But climate change can be one of the factors forcing migratory birds to visit new areas. Since most of these species rest near water they will shift location if the water is polluted,” said Dr Kailash Chandra, director, Zoological Survey of India. Located in Howrah district but only a 30-minute drive away from south Kolkata, Santragachhi lake used to be a haven for large migratory birds such as the Baikal teal from east Russia. “The Baikal teal were seen only once in the last five years. The reasons could be civil constructions in the vicinity and sewerage disposal in the lake,” said Manna. “However, at Piyali, a river island in South 24 Parganas district located closer to Bay of Bengal, birds never seen in the area before landed in large numbers in the last three winters.” added Manna. Arjan Basu Roy, secretary of Nature Mates, a non-government organisation working in Santragachhi and the Sunderbans, said, “There has been a steady decline in migration to Santragachhi because of human intervention. Birds that rest here are mostly vegetarian and look for food in nearby farmlands after dusk. Around 3000 birds arrived till the second week of December but numbers do not necessarily mean it’s a healthy migration.”"
          
" On December 15, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) gave the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC) time until January 31 to clarify its position on the need for prior environment clearances for inland waterway transport (IWT) projects, including the marquee Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP) along the river Ganga on National Waterway 1 between Haldia and Allahabad. On January 1, 50 experts and environmental activists wrote a letter to Union environment minister, Harsh Vardhan, urging him to make prior environmental clearances mandatory for IWT projects. Currently, clearances are issued on a case-to-case basis and are not mandatory. The National Waterways Act, 2016, identified 111 rivers or stretches as national waterways for commercial navigation. The Centre is very optimistic about the project because it claims IWT is “fuel efficient, cost effective and environment friendly mode of transport …” (National Waterways Bill, 2015). Such claims are neither unqualified nor universal. These 111 waterways will pass through 24 states and two Union Territories (20,274 km) and involve 138 river systems, creeks, estuaries and canal systems, and also cut through at least 20 wildlife protected areas. The plan does not take into account the monsoonal hydrology of India’s rivers when they are either too full or too low. So how will the Centre ensure that there is enough water round the year in the rivers for large ships to navigate them? This would then obviously need physical interventions (dredging and dams). The Centre also needs to take into account two other factors: fuel consumption and vehicle speed will vary depending upon the direction of travel (downstream or upstream). A 2016 sector study into Waterway 1 (Ganga) (IWT sector development strategy and Business development study for capacity augmentation of National Waterway 1 from Haldia to Allahabad” Vol 1, Report Part A, by HPC Hamburg Port Consulting GMbh, Germany and UNICONSULT, Germany) found that “among the most visible weaknesses of IWT are the low transport speed and its limited area of operation, depending on the infrastructural premises and depth of the waterways, disruptions due to weather are other possible threats”. The IWT will also need associated infrastructure such as jetties, river ports, terminals and access roads. For example, Waterway 1 (Ganga) from Allahabad (Uttar Pradesh) till Haldia (West Bengal) will have terminals at Allahabad, Varanasi, Gazipur (UP), Sahibganj (Jharkhand) and Katwa (West Bengal). According to a study by RITES, an engineering consultancy company: “Corresponding advantage of IWT over rail and road transport in terms of vehicle operating costs goes adverse when terminal costs involved in the case of IWT also forms part of comparison.” Facts such as the distance between Allahabad and Haldia through Waterway is 1,600 km compared to 900 km by road cannot be ignored. Clearly, the financials of IWT are not as healthy as they have been made out to be. On the environment front, extensive and regular dredging of rivers will destroy their morphological integrity, flora and fauna and river-dependent livelihoods. A scientific study by Bangalore-based ATREE said that noise from large ships could adversely affect river dolphins.

" Chemistry, e-business, human rights, social inclusion and climate change — both online and offline refresher courses in subjects like these are helping college and university professors refurbish their skills, spruce up their CVs and pass on updated information to students. Last month, SGTB Khalsa College at Delhi University launched an online refresher course in chemistry. It’s the first digital course on the subject, designed and developed by the National Resource Centre of Chemistry (NRCC) of the HRD ministry. “Chemistry knowledge is growing fast and so, many new sub-disciplines like astrochemistry, food chemistry and green chemistry have emerged,” says AK Bakhshi, chairman of the NRCC. “So, we’ve included modules that focus on the latest developments in the subject, safe disposal of chemicals and greener alternatives to chemicals.” The course is taught via video tutorials and online quizzes. The centre sought inputs from academicians like Bharat Ratna awardee CNR Rao and Ved Prakash, former chairman of the University Grants Commission. The course also includes ICT (or information and communications technology) tools such as how to create animation storyboards or audio-visual recordings, how to track a learner’s performance online, etc, to help teachers improve their chemistry training methods. In all, over 2,300 teachers have signed up for the free, online course that ends in February. “Before this, teachers used to attend offline refresher courses but many times, they could not find time or could not get leave for the same,” says Vimal Rarh, chemistry faculty and coordinator for the NRCC. Besides the sciences, refresher courses in business and commerce are also finding takers. Earlier this month, Khyati Vora completed a 21-day on-site refresher course in business management from Bhagat Phool Singh Mahila Vishwavidyalaya in Haryana, a state university recognised by the UGC. Vora, who has been teaching an introduction to business and management course at the BCom level at the Hinduja college in Mumbai for a decade, says she wanted to know more about how business management works differently in areas such as e-commerce and startups. The course covered topics such as agro-tourism management, social media marketing and contemporary issues in the field of intellectual property rights. “The case studies were fascinating,” Vora says. “Even though commerce textbooks are revised periodically, they have barely any case studies. Here, the speakers shared real-world stories and that really makes sense for someone teaching IT and business management.” Fellowships are also becoming an important gateway for professors to enhance their research and connect with a global community of experts in their field. Chirantan Chatterjee, associate professor of business policy and economics at the Indian Institute of Management - Ahmedabad is currently on the year-long National Fellows programme at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution."
" More than 1.6 million people have signed an online petition to take the French state to court for not doing enough to fight climate change. Greenpeace, Oxfam and two French environmental groups launched the petition last week. Their signature drive received exceptional support in just a few days, including from film stars Marion Cotillard and Juliette Binoche. Greenpeace France director Jean-Francois Julliard said on France’s BFM television Monday that the groups hope for an eventual court ruling requiring France to further lower carbon emissions. Julliard says the legal effort could take years, but cited a similar, successful effort in the Netherlands."
" In a media dominated age, no international conference is allowed to end in failure. The Katowice climate summit is no exception. Michal Kurtyka, the Polish President of the conference, admitted that finding global consensus on the issues discussed at the summit had been “politically fraught”, but claimed nonetheless that “through this package, you have made 1,000 little steps forward together”. The truth is the exact opposite. The Katowice summit was a resounding failure. The size of the failure has to be measured against the urgency of the challenge it refused to face. A bare six weeks earlier, the IPCC had warned that the world had to reduce net carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 and bring them down to zero by 2055, if it wanted to keep the planet livable in the 21st century. But the conference turned its back on the warning. There was no agreement on financing, and little of it even on the verification methods to be used for assessing claims of carbon reduction. even There was no consensus even on whether the conference should accept a reduction of the limit to global warming by 2100 from 2 degrees Celsius to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Why has the world buried its head in the sand ? The short answer is that it does not know what else to do. Nearly everyone is blaming US President Donald Trump, but his denial of climate change is only a brusque way of saying that he would rather not know about something that he cannot prevent. Emission reductions of this magnitude seem impossible because they can only be achieved by a rapid shift out of fossil fuels. But no one knows what to replace them with. This is not because renewable energy technologies that draw their power from the sun do not exist, but because none of the 24 climate summits held since 1994 ever discussed technology. The job of finding alternatives to fossil fuels was left to the free interplay of market forces. A Clean Development Mechanism was set up under the Kyoto Protocol to encourage the search for alternatives. But in the first 10 years of its existence it reduced greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 1.58 billion tonnes. In the same period, human-induced CO2 emissions increased by 10 billion tonnes. Today it is apparent that the market has led us astray. The only renewable energy technologies that it has promoted vigorously are wind and solar photovoltaic power. This despite the common knowledge that these can only limit and not replace fossil fuels because they can neither supply guaranteed, round the clock power, nor the process heat that industry consumes in prodigious quantities. Had technology, and not target setting, been the focus of COP summits, the world would have known that technologies that can harness the energy of the sun for meeting all the three needs — power, heat and transport fuels — already exist and have been now refined to the point where they are fully competitive with fossil fuels. The two that can do so virtually without limit are Concentrated Solar Thermal (CSP), as opposed to photovoltaic (SPV) power, and biomass gasification, as opposed to fermentation. Far from being new, these have been in sporadic use for between four and ten decades. The first CSP power station that fed electricity into the grid came up in California in the 1980s. The first plant that turned municipal solid waste into methanol — a clean and superior transport fuel — came on stream in the USA in 1922! CSP power stations solved the problem of storing the energy of the sun at night in the late 1980s. The first power station to supply round-the-clock power to a small town near Seville in Spain came on stream in 2011 and has been doing so for seven years. The cost of generation from CSP plants has fallen almost as fast as that from photovoltaic plants. The most recent power purchase agreements for such plants have been signed in Chile and Dubai for 5 to 6. 7 cents per kwh. That is half the average cost of power in the US in 2017, which was 12.06 cents. What is more important, these are lower than the cost of power generation by new coal based power plants. So the way is now open for more governments to join the 30 countries have already agreed to put a ban the establishment of new coal based power plants. Most of the world’s attention has been focused so far on power generation. But there are now several proven, versatile, technologies that can also produce transport fuels and petrochemicals from literally any crop residue or waste biomass. They do this by first gasifying the biomass to obtain a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen called synthesis gas, and then synthesise these into the desired fuel or petrochemical, using appropriate catalysts. Unlike solar thermal power, these technologies have not so far got off the ground because the investment in them, that has been planned repeatedly since the early 2000s, has been repeatedly postponed or abandoned because of steep, albeit temporary, falls in the price of oil and natural gas. These have made it impossible for the investors to get the long term purchase price agreements that will make their investment secure. To save the future, the world does not need carbon dioxide capture and removal. It does not need to pump sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere to reduce sunlight. It does not need hundreds of billions of dollars of subsidies for expensive renewable energy technologies. All it needs is a ban on the setting up of new coal-based power plants, and stable price agreements with producers of synthetic fuels that are linked to the long term average cost of oil and gas. These will suffice to make private capital flow as spontaneously into solar thermal and biomass energy projects as it is doing into wind and solar PV projects today.

" A newly-discovered blind amphibian will be named after Donald Trump in recognition of the US president’s stance on climate change, according to a media report. EnviroBuild, a UK-based sustainable building materials company, announced on Tuesday that it would be using Dermophis donaldtrumpi as the name for the amphibian with no legs and poor eyesight. The company says the name still will need to undergo peer review, but that other animals have been named after presidents in the past. The name was chosen by Aidan Bell, the boss of the firm which paid thousands at an auction for the right, The Guardian reported. The small creature is blind and has an ability to bury its head in the ground. These features Bell said match the US leader’s opinion on climate change. The company said Trump’s was “the perfect name” for the limbless animal. The Panamanian underground amphibians are particularly vulnerable to global warming. Dermophis donaldtrumpi, 10 centimetres in length and belonging to group of snakelike animals called caecilians, was recently found in Panama by a group of scientists. Its naming rights were auctioned off in a fundraiser for Rainforest Trust, a non-profit rainforest conservation organisation, the report said. The winning bid of USD 34,478 was made by Aidan Bell, the head of a UK-based sustainable building materials company called EnviroBuild. “It is the perfect name,” Bell said. “Caecilian is taken from the Latin caecus, meaning ‘blind’, perfectly mirroring the strategic vision President Trump has consistently shown towards climate change,” he said. Bell said Trump’s worldview resembled a caecilian’s, whose eyes can only detect light and dark. “Capable of seeing the world only in black and white. Donald Trump has claimed that climate change is a hoax by the Chinese,” he added. The world’s leading scientists agree that climate change is primarily human-induced. But Trump, whose administration has pursued a pro-fossil fuels agenda, has accused those scientists of having a “political agenda” and cast doubt on whether humans were responsible for the Earth’s rising temperatures. “I don’t know that it’s manmade,” he said in an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes in October. “I’m not denying climate change but [temperatures] could very well go back,” he added, without offering evidence. Trump in June last year withdrew the US from the Paris climate change agreement, which commits countries to keeping a limit on rising global temperatures. He justified this decision by asserting that he had been elected to serve the citizens of Pittsburgh and not Paris and the deal disadvantaged US businesses and workers. Caecilians lost their limbs at least 60 million years ago to better burrow in the earth, and live almost entirely underground."
  
            
" As many as 195 countries evolved and adopted a set of guidelines – the Paris Rulebook — for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement to strengthen the global response to climate change late on Saturday evening in Poland’s Katowice. The rulebook was adopted after two weeks of negotiations to resolve major differences between developed, developing and a coalition of least developed countries at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP24). In Katowice, the environment ministry’s joint secretary, Ravi Shankar Prasad, made a statement on India’s behalf on Saturday expressing reservations regarding certain parts of the rulebook. He cited the lack of equity in the global stocktake process, a five-yearly review of the implementation of the Paris Agreement . Equity would mean that the developed countries take the lead while developing and least developed countries also take action to combat climate change in accordance with their capacities. Later, the ministry issued a statement on Sunday saying India welcomed the rulebook as its concerns have been addressed in the final version. “India considers the outcome of COP 24 a positive one which addresses concerns of all parties and sets us on the path towards successful implementation of the Paris Agreement.” Civil society groups and the least developed countries have expressed their concerns about how effective the rulebook or the Katowice Climate Package. The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a Delhi-based advocacy organisation, said the countries are pretty much on their own to mitigate, adapt and pay for climate impacts. “The UNFCCC [UN Framework Convention on Climate Change] is now a platform to collect and synthesise information and provide a forum to discuss and debate. It does not have the tools to drive global collective action to combat climate change. In such a situation, one needs to seriously question the raison d’être of the UNFCCC,” said CSE deputy director general Chandra Bhushan. According to the CSE, the developed countries have the choice to include all kinds of financial instruments as climate finance including loans. It said the reporting of financial grants by developed countries and review of whether it is adequate has also been weakened. In the global stocktake section to measure global progress and identify how countries are adapting to or mitigating climate change, there is now no provision on addressing these issues, the CSE added. “The result is that a lot of technical information will be collected without any clear recommendation to increase ambition on mitigation or finance,” the CSE said in a statement. The negotiations were extended for a day after the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) expressed concerns over the draft rulebook. LDCs and AOSIS said it was weak on addressing ‘loss and damage’, which refers to irreversible climate impacts certain vulnerable parts of the world face, and on saving the world from breaching the 1.5-degree celsius warming over pre-industrial levels. In the final text, ‘loss and damage’ has got more attention. But the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s 1.5-degree global warming report have not been taken on board. The successful completion of the report has been welcomed. “The 1.5 report, loss and damage and other small island priorities are reflected in the compromise text. But it must be said that addressing climate change is ultimately a political challenge, not a technical one. Unless world leaders treat climate change as the global emergency it is... it may slip beyond our control,” said AOSIS chairperson Hussain Rasheed Hassan. The environment ministry said the guidance on finance provisions operationalises the obligation of developed countries in providing means of implementation to developing countries and recognises the need for climate finance to be new and additional and climate specific. “Parties have also agreed to initiate the work on setting up the new collective finance goals post-2020 from the floor of USD 100 billion.”     "
        
         
                          
             
                    
             
    
" The Paris Agreement of 2015 proved to be a game changer. It focused global efforts towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions as well as strengthening the ability of countries to deal with the unavoidable impacts of climate change. At CoP-24 in Katowice, Poland, world leaders have reconvened to strengthen the global movement for a climate resilient growth. Since the Paris agreement, developing countries like India have made a significant progress in meeting their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). This year’s climate talks at Katowice focuses on establishing the “Paris Rulebook” that will set out to enable implementation of the Paris Agreement, as well as in mobilising capital needed to implement the agreement. This provides a window of opportunity for the private sector to step up and demonstrate its commitment towards positive climate action. The private sector is increasingly taking heed of the strong signal sent by the Paris Agreement. According to an International Finance Corporation (IFC) report, 179 companies across all sectors have committed to set an emissions reduction target that supports the global effort to combat global warming. Companies are increasingly engaging in the sector, not just by means of investments, but also by building resilience into their own functions. To scale up the momentum, it’s important for the governments to mobilise private capital. For instance, enabling reliable policies and eliminating counterproductive policies will help strengthen the investment climate. One such example is the Clean Environment Cess on the use of coal in India that discourages the production and consumption of coal by increasing its cost, while part of the government revenue from the cess is reallocated to support renewable energy development. Another classic example of reforming a government policy from India is on amending the Electricity Act, 2003 that allowed up to 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) under the automatic route for renewable energy generation and distribution projects. Since the early 2000s, incentives offered by the federal government to attract FDI have allowed the country’s emerging wind and solar power industries to lower their per unit generation cost, thereby making them cost-competitive with other fossil fuels. These forward-looking reforms are undoubtedly benefiting mitigation actions. However, there is a dire need of replicating this practice to adaptation for improving the investment climate. More can be done to build a comprehensive robust environment to promote capital flows and ensure that climate considerations are integrated into sector policies. Strategic measures to internalise climate change as a risk, build competition and measures to promote investment are crucial. With India tirelessly working towards achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, there is still a gap in adequate and accessible finance that needs to be addressed. According to an IFC analysis, India’s estimated climate smart investment potential for selected sectors is $2.1 trillion from 2016-2030, which presents an enormous opportunity to fill the lacuna. To mobilise private sector investment in these sectors, it’s important to move beyond grant-based projects. Providing a space which enables the private sector to initiate social development and incur economic benefits simultaneously would be an optimal approach. For instance, sediment management is one such targeted approach that can enhance resilience and open avenues for business opportunities. A framework developed for river Kosi and endorsed by the government of Bihar details the technical, environmental and commercial viability of extraction and end use of silt. This framework is not only a strong value proposition for the solution to recurring floods in the state but also a revenue realisation for business that can make use of silt as a resource. The framework identifies the scope for developing revenue streams, projections on investments and a sustainability plan. The proposed plan is a for-profit model for investors (both government and private sector) that provides an integrated approach to effectively manage flooding, promote climate resilient agriculture and water management practices and create livelihood options. It is crucial to build such business plans on other interventions that provide a fair chance for the private sector to leverage business opportunities arising from priority climate resilient development actions. The synergies between development progress and the opportunities to invest in resilience building will remain at the centre of the climate finance landscape for years to come. The recently released Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report highlights the need for collective action to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Climate smart investments will thereby play a key role in providing support to governments in achieving their NDCs and enhancing resilience. CoP-24, which focuses on effectively operationalising the Paris Agreement, has provided an appropriate global platform to discuss and channelise the vast opportunities that the climate finance landscape presents. The changing climate is disproportionately impacting the economically disadvantaged and slowing development; a disparity which is likely to increase as climate change accelerates. A study by the World Bank suggests that developing countries will need about $100 billion of new investments per year over the next 40 years to build resilience to the effects of climate change. This enormous burden cannot be carried out by national governments alone and needs the buy-in and participation of the private sector. Mainstreaming climate-smart investment from the private sector will be instrumental to enable a resilient, equitable, and sustainable society.

" Assam and Mizoram are the most vulnerable to climate change among the Himalayan states, according to a study presented by a team of Indian scientists at the COP 24 climate conference being held in Katowice, Poland. The team studied 12 western and eastern Himalayan states on various parameters crucial for adaptation to climate change such as irrigated area, per capita income (for 2014-15), area under crop insurance, forest cover and the extent of slopes. The data for these parameters has been taken from government records such as the census and annual reports. The team, which has scientists from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc, Bengaluru), the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) at Mandi, Himachal Pradesh, and IIT , Guwahati, found that Assam and Mizoram ranked highest on the vulnerability index, while Uttarakhand and Sikkim were the lowest relative to other hill states assessed. Assam has higher vulnerability because it has one of the lowest areas under irrigation and lowest forest area per 1,000 rural households among the 12 states. Besides, it has lowest per capita income, lowest area under crop insurance and relatively low participation in the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Guarantee Scheme, which provides 100 days of employment (unskilled public work) to at least one adult member of every poor rural household. Mizoram is also highly vulnerable because of the same issues but also because at least 30% of the geographical area is under slope. Jammu and Kashmir has the third highest vulnerability ranking, mainly because it has no area under crop insurance, least road density, low percentage of area under horticulture crops, low livestock to human ratio and low percentage of women in the overall workforce, among other factors. Also read | India should take the lead on climate change “Vulnerability to climate change is not about how much high temperature or high rainfall a region is going to experience. It is about the economic, social and environmental resources you have access to. So it will include money, infrastructure and many other factors. For example if there is frequent crop damage, a community would have to depend on the forests nearby which is an environmental resource. Developed countries for example can do it because they have resources. I believe this is a very important study for India which is struggling with climate impacts,” said Sanjay Vashist, director, Climate Action Network South Asia, a coalition of civil society organisations working to limit human-induced climate change. Sikkim has the lowest vulnerability because it has the highest per capita income among the states assessed, lowest area under open forests but good coverage of dense forests, large area under orchards and a low population density. NH Ravindranath, professor, Centre for Sustainable Technologies at IISc, made a presentation on these findings at Katowice on Tuesday. The Indian team said this vulnerability ranking will help in prioritising investment in mechanisms to adapt to climate change-in prioritising districts, blocks, communities, forest types and cropping systems and others. “The vulnerability ranking will help the government rank most vulnerable states and districts within a state and undertake adaptation on priority. Indian Institute of Science developed the guidelines along with IIT Gauwhati,” said NH Rabindranath who presented the report in Katowice. A report on the index was released by union environment minister, Harsh Vardhan."
      
         
" India on Monday assured the ongoing climate change conference at Katowice in Poland that the country is committed to meeting its climate goals. In 2015, the country, as part of the requirement ahead of the finalisation of the Paris Agreement, listed a series of specific actions it would take to fight climate change. One of the important promises that India made was that it would create 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of additional carbon sinks through extensive afforestation. A key strategy to achieve this goal will be to promote agroforestry or farm forestry, says a report in the Hindustan Times. This focus on agroforestry, a judicious integration of tree species with agricultural crops and/or animals, is not unexpected since the practice is now recognised as an important one to restore degraded land and improve farmers’ incomes. Trees are valuable and profitable parts of agricultural systems because they provide timber, food and fuel, make soils more fertile, and protect the ecosystem services that agriculture depends upon. Agroforestry, however, is not unknown in India; it is practised across the country. But many farmers are not keen to take it up because of a lack of information on tree rotation and also the legal aspects involved in the trade of matured trees. To streamline the process, the Centre came up with the National Agroforestry Policy in 2014 to bring together various agroforestry programmes of different ministries under one platform. While the focus on agroforestry to meet the twin objectives of meeting climate goals and improving the livelihood of farmers is laudable, there are concerns. One of the strongest criticisms is the emphasis on involving private players in the afforestation efforts, which leads to the question of benefit sharing between them and the landowners/community. Second, experts say the policy is trying to convert agricultural land into a manufacturing enterprise, which is not an ecologically sound solution. This is because agroforestry, which has a commercial motive at heart, usually leads to planting one particular species of tree. Third, an agricultural plot is not about farming only; it also supports different kinds of wildlife and communities such as pastoralists. The moment a piece of land comes under any kind of plantation, there will be questions about issues of access and community rights."
" After a wait of 14 months, the Uttarakhand forest department finally got the approval from the state government in November, to form a research body to conserve the flora of the Himalayan state. The body named, Centre for Research, Development and Conservation of Himalayan Forestry Resources- an autonomous body- will work for “development and collection of quality seeds of forest species, preparation of quality clones and livelihood issues”. The proposal for formation of the research society was first sent to the state forest department in September 2017 after which the proposal was sent to the state government. Sanjiv Chaturvedi, chief conservator, Research with the forest department said, “Despite delays, the research body has got the approval and will start working by the second week of December. The body, a first of its own for research, will run on funds from different companies under their corporate social responsibility.” The initial proposal letter sent to the forest department states that funds from corporates would be used for various research projects under the society as budgets are not passed on time and that affects the daily work routine, including salary payments of employees. The research body headquartered in Haldwani will advise the state forest department in determination of the policies for conservation of rare, endangered and threatened species found in the Himalayan region. Chaturvedi informed that the body will also form a reliable database of the forestry resources of the state and undertake the assessment and impact of climate change in the Himalayan region. The additional secretary of forest and environment, Dhiraj Pandey, could not be reached for a comment on what caused the delay in the approval."
                  
" Leaders of the Group of 20 agreed Saturday to fix the world trading system after difficult, all-night talks in the Argentine capital, but only 19 of them agreed to support the Paris accord on fighting climate change with the United States the lone holdout. The official summit statement acknowledges flaws in global commerce and calls for reforming the World Trade Organization. It doesn’t mention the word “protectionism,” however, after negotiators said that had met resistance from the United States. Applause broke out in the summit hall as the leaders, including US president Donald Trump, signed off on a final statement at the end of a two-day summit. The non-binding agreement was reached after talks by diplomats stretched overnight and into daylight on Saturday, amid deep divisions between member nations. European Union officials said the United States was the main holdout on nearly every issue. Trump has criticized the WTO and taken aggressive trade policies targeting China and the EU. But China also pushed back in talks on steel, South Africa objected to language on trade, Australia didn’t want the statement to be too soft on migration and Turkey worried it would push too far on climate change, according to the officials. Read: India to host first G20 summit in 2022, to coincide with 75th year of Independence A senior White House official said the joint statement meets many US objectives and stressed that it includes language about WTO reform. The official also noted other elements such as language on workforce development and women’s economic development and a commitment by China to doing infrastructure financing on “transparent terms.” According to the official, the language on climate was necessary for Washington to sign on, and Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Russia had appeared sympathetic to the US position but ultimately stayed with the other countries. With trade tensions between the US and China dominated the summit, the Europeans sought to play mediator. They also scaled back their expectations, cutting out mention of rising protectionism — mainly aimed at Trump. The final language of the statement says, regarding climate, that 19 nations that are signatories to the Paris accord reiterate their commitment to it while the US reiterates its decision to withdraw. It also notes a recent UN report that warned damage from global warming will be much worse than previously feared, and expresses support for an upcoming UN climate meeting in Poland meant to nail down how countries will meet promises made in the Paris accord. On global commerce, the statement says the 20 countries support multilateral trade but acknowledge that the current system doesn’t work and needs fixing, via “the necessary reform of the WTO to improve its functioning.” On migration, European officials said the US negotiator said too much talk about it would have been a “deal-breaker” for Trump. So they came up with “minimalist” language that acknowledges growing migrant flows and the importance of shared efforts to support refugees and solve the problems that drive them to flee. Read: PM Modi meets EU leaders, discusses on strengthening joint effort to counter terrorism The statement also shows a commitment to a “rules-based international order,” despite Trump’s rejection of many of those rules. “There were moments when we thought all was lost,” one European official said, “moments when we spent two hours on one sentence.” The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations. Thomas Bernes of the Canada-based Centre for International Governance Innovation, who has held leading roles with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Canadian government, said the G-20 had “veered all over the road” at the summit and failed to truly fix trade. The US was out of step on migration and climate change and blocked meaningful agreement on those issues, he added. “Instead, leaders buried their differences in obscure language and dropped language to fight protectionism, which had been included in every G-20 communique since the leaders’ first summit,” he added. “This is clearly a retrograde step forced by United States intransigence.” “The question is whether we are burying the G-20 in the process,” Bernes added. “Certainly this is a big hit to the credibility of the G-20 to provide resolute leadership in addressing global problems.” Perhaps surprisingly, one country that was seen as particularly constructive was Russia, the EU officials said. Despite tensions over its military actions on Ukraine and political interference abroad, Russia supports international efforts on trade and climate. Read: A high-five from Vladimir Putin and that awkward photograph - Saudi prince’s G20 summit While a statement isn’t legally enforceable, the Europeans see it as proof that the G-20 is still relevant and that multilateralism still works. “Everyone agrees that the WTO should be reformed,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel said. “This is an important agreement.” “We will send a clear signal — in any case, most of us” — for the success of global climate talks starting in Poland on Sunday, Merkel added. Merkel’s spokesman said that during a meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin, she also voiced concern about rising tensions in the Kerch Strait off Crimea and pushed for “freedom of shipping into the Sea of Azov.” Last weekend, Russia seized three Ukrainian naval vessels and their crews in an incident escalating a tug-of-war that began in 2014 when Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and supported separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. Germany and France have sought to mediate between Russia and Ukraine, and spokesman Steffen Seibert said Merkel and Putin agreed that the four countries should hold further talks at the “adviser level.” Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping were due to meet later Saturday after the summit’s close. Their countries have been embroiled in an escalating trade war with new US tariffs on China goods set to take effect a month from now. “The trade war between the United States and China does not favour international commerce. ... A fight between two big players does not benefit,” said Dante Sica, Argentina’s minister of production and labour. “If they are able to begin to agree, it would be a good signal that would reduce the impacts on international commerce.” In closing remarks, summit host and Argentine president Mauricio Macri said the countries had overcome “a number of challenges” to reach the agreement. “We have agreed on a statement that reflects the necessity of revitalizing trade, of revitalizing the WTO. .. “We ratify the concern of everyone over climate change,” Macri said."
             
          
          
   
                
      
        
               
      
" Last week, the UN World Meteorological Organization’s (WMO) annual Greenhouse Gas Bulletin said that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere hit a new record last year with emissions showing no sign of slowing down, dashing hopes for a deceleration in emissions of CO2 — the by-product of burning fossil fuels that scientists say is the main cause of the greenhouse effect which causes global warming. “Without rapid cuts in CO2 and other greenhouse gases, climate change will have increasingly destructive and irreversible impacts on life on Earth. The window of opportunity for action is almost closed,” WMO Secretary-General, Petteri Taalas, said in a statement. This report must be read along with the one released by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in October. The world’s leading climate scientists warned in that report that there is only a dozen years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C, beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. While both reports paint a possible doomsday scenario, countries cannot but continue to be aggressive about tackling climate change because, as Patricia Espinosa, head of the UN framework convention on climate change, said, “falling into despair and hopelessness is a danger equal to complacency, none of which we can afford”. If the world wants to slow down the onward march of climate change, it needs to invest in low-carbon technologies like wind, solar, and electric transport, and such products need to be in the mainstream. And that’s not happening at a pace that is required across the world. Take for example, India. At the Paris climate summit in 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a target of generating 175 GW of power from renewable sources by 2022. Out of this, 100 GW is slated to come from solar energy. But in the third quarter of 2018, the country added 1,697 megawatts (MW) of solar power capacity, according to Bridge to India, a renewable energy consultancy firm (published in Quartz). This is marginally better than the previous quarter, when the numbers fell to their lowest level since early 2017, but is still far below the 4,130 MW added in the first quarter of this year, the report said. “Our revised best-case estimate for solar capacity by March 2022 is 67 GW, well short of the 100 GW target unless decisive remedial steps are taken immediately,” Bridge to India said."
               
" The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere hit a new record last year with emissions showing no sign of slowing down, the UN World Meteorological Organization said on Thursday. The annual Greenhouse Gas Bulletin dashed hopes for a slowdown in emissions of CO2 - the byproduct of burning fossil fuels that scientists say is the main cause of the greenhouse effect causing global warming. “The science is clear. Without rapid cuts in CO2 and other greenhouse gases, climate change will have increasingly destructive and irreversible impacts on life on Earth. The window of opportunity for action is almost closed,” WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement. The report found CO2 levels of 405.5 parts per million in 2017, up from 403.3 ppm in 2016. The rate of increase is in line with the average growth rate over the last decade, which was the fastest rate for 55 million years, the WMO said. Carbon dioxide levels have risen 46 percent since the pre-industrial era, around 1750. “The most alarming thing is that ... half of the increase from pre-industrial times comes within the last 30 years,” said Oksana Tarasova, head of WMO’s atmospheric environment research. The rise was expected to be much lower in 2017, because the previous year saw “El Nino” weather conditions, which are normally followed by a big slowdown in the growth of CO2 concentrations. U.N. climate talks in Poland next month are meant to agree a rule book for the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change, which set a sweeping goal of ending the fossil fuel era this century. U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has sent a letter to all states, telling them they have legal obligations under international human rights law to prevent climate change and try to mitigate its effects. The United States is the only country to have announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris accord, and President Donald Trump has cast doubt on the science underpinning it. “Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming?”, Trump tweeted on Wednesday. WMO chief scientist Pavel Kabat said unusually cold weather was consistent with climate change. “On the longer timescale we are not that much worried about the current political disturbance,” he said."
" At a time when the battle between development and environment is being fought every day across India, the Union environment ministry has given us something to cheer about. It has identified 20 wetlands and nine wetland clusters for conservation as they are congregation sites for migratory water bird species. These wetlands, which will be protected as part of the Centre’s Central Asian Flyway Action Plan launched on Monday, include Keoladeo in Rajasthan, Coringa in Andhra Pradesh, Bhitarkanika in Odisha, Point Calimere in Tamil Nadu, Sunderbans in West Bengal, Harike in Punjab, Gulf of Mannar, and Nal Soravar in Gujarat. This is a crucial development since wetlands — mangroves, marshes, paddy fields, swamps etc — are important stopovers for birds, and also work as a giant sponge that soaks up and stores extra rainfall and water from storm surges. Like in other parts of the world, in India, too, wetlands are under threat, thanks to expanding agriculture, deforestation, climate change, land encroachment and urban development. A recent study by the Global Wetland Convention found that nearly 35% of the world’s wetlands were lost between 1970 and 2015. While we must celebrate the Indian government’s decision to save the 20 wetlands, it is important to remember that while earmarking and protecting particular ecologically-sensitive areas is critical, it is not enough. There are thousands of unprotected wetlands, forests, sacred groves, grasslands, community forests, urban forests etc — our natural commons — in this country which are vulnerable to land use change, and every time we lose a bit of them, we lose a substantial amount of ecological heritage."
  
               
      
             
" The earth’s protective ozone layer is recovering! In a UN-backed report released last week titled Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion: 2018, authored by an expert panel working with the World Meteorological Organisation and the United Nations Environment Programme, has stated that the collaborative efforts of signatory countries of the Montreal Protocol have helped heal the ozone layer, providing a ray of hope. These reports are carried out once every four years under the aforementioned protocol. While the Northern Hemisphere leads the race and expects its ozone layer to be completely healed by the 2030s, the Southern Hemisphere lags behind, and expects to reach complete closure by mid-century. In bigger news, if countries continue to keep this commitment, the gaping hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic should disappear by the 2060s. The biggest cause of the depletion was the presence of various ozone-depleting substances (ODS) such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons, which constitute CFC-11 emissions, and were ultimately banned in 2010. Between then and now, efforts to replace these chemicals with less harmful ones such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) have begun to pay off. India and China are big users of HFCs due to their population. They are coolants used in refrigerators and air conditioners. Finalised in 1987, the Montreal Protocol has been hailed as the one of the most successful and effective environmental treaties ever negotiated and implemented, aimed solely at preventing the depletion of the ozone layer and protecting humans from the ultraviolet rays of the sun. The treaty also gives developing and underdeveloped signatory countries a buffer period to completely stop the use of HFCs, which do not directly affect ozone depletion but are global warmers. In 2015, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi met then US President Barack Obama, India vowed to stop using HFCs and look for more environment friendly options for coolants."
" It is that time of the year when one routinely encounters people hacking and coughing in the metros, thanks to the toxic pea soup that is the atmosphere. With this come expert opinions on why this is so and how the air can be cleared. By and large, the consensus is that the poisonous air is part of climate change in progress, whether man-made or natural. It is also the time of the year when many people are forced to stay away from work thanks to the debilitating effects of pollution or other climate-related issues. And here is where the gender factor comes into play, especially in a low income country like India. Women face a much higher risk of the ill-effects of climate change. For a start, a majority start life with nutritional deficiencies as a result of prejudices against the girl child. Climate affects health through a multiplicity of ways from extreme heat or cold, poor air quality, poor water quality and lack of food security. All these factors are common to both genders but where women are at a disadvantage is in their lack of or limited access to healthcare. Despite commendable strides in making healthcare accessible to all, facilities in rural areas, even in many urban ones , are not geared to cater to climate-related health problems. Women do not go to clinics or hospitals due to lack of transportation, fears related to their safety, and the simple fact that their health is a low priority for the family. . Unlike educated and empowered women, rural or uneducated women who suffer pollution-related illnesses don’t even realise this. There is little public communication and awareness of this. They believe their illness is just tiredness or a fever which will pass. Cooking indoors using wood or coal is another reason why women suffer from pollution-related ailments. In rural areas, women spend much longer inside their homes cooking with fuels which give off carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and particulate matter all of which are detrimental to their health. Many of these pollutants affect not just the women but their unborn children as well. Poverty plays a major role in the health of women who are forced to migrate from rural to urban areas. The homeless in cities are often forced to make do with inadequate housing or none at all leaving them vulnerable to polluted air and toxins from poor cooking or heating infrastructure. The big problem in countries such as India is the near total exclusion of women from the decision-making process on mitigating climate change. Women are powerful vehicles of social change in many areas. Rather than a faceless bureaucrat or expert in a distant place speaking about the benefits of decreasing the impact of climate change, women who are at the greatest risk should. They should be among the key stakeholders in marrying traditional knowledge with scientific and technological inputs. Now that it is election season and pollution and other climate change aspects are talking points, all parties have a chance to take this up as a serious development issue. Maybe this is too much to hope for, but what a mighty leap it would be for India both economically and socially to invest in capacity and skill-building for women to combat climate change. The first thing to be done should be institute mechanisms to gather data on area-specific environmental problems. Many of us think a pastoral life is conducive to clean living. It is not. The threats are different but they are there. It is not as simple as distributing smokeless chullas which many NGOs believe to be a panacea. The answer has to come with local inputs and local knowledge. The number of work days lost and the health costs of pollution in Delhi alone, if computed, should give an idea of how short-sighted it is to let things slide once the visible signs of danger are over. The problems are clear and present all year around to millions who do not have air purifiers, masks, clean water or fuel. When it comes to cleaning up the air (and the environment), women can lead the way. They just need to be given a chance to do so."
" India has declared that nuclear energy is vital for meeting the challenge of climate change and suggested supporting efforts to promote its public acceptance amid growing opposition to nuclear power and plans by some countries to phase out their atomic generation plants. “Nuclear power remains an important option to meet the challenges of increased energy demand, address concerns about climate change, redress volatile fossil fuel prices and ensure security of the energy supply,” Sandeep Kumar Bayyapu, a first secretary in India’s UN Mission told the General Assembly on Friday. Therefore, he said the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should support efforts by countries to build public acceptance of nuclear energy and continue to help them start or expand nuclear energy programmes. Nuclear reactors do not produce greenhouse gases like power plants using coal and, therefore, can increase electricity generation without contributing to climate change. They can provide a steady supply of electricity because unlike solar and wind power sources, nuclear plants can operate when there is no sun or wind and are not affected by fluctuations in water availability like hydroelectric plants. To meet one of the points of opposition to nuclear power plants, Bayyapu advocated building advanced fission reactors, including fast reactors, that use nuclear fuel more efficiently and reduce radioactive waste. While speaking during the debate on the IAEA’s annual report, he presented thorium-based technologies as solutions to other objections to nuclear plants. Bayyapu said thorium-based fuel cycles and technologies are inherently less susceptible to be used for weapons production and can also provide enhanced passive safety features. According to the Department of Atomic Energy, India is planning to more than treble its nuclear electricity generation from the current 6,780 megawatts to 22,480 megawatts by 2031. Of the nine reactors under construction, one is an advanced fast breeder reactor with 500 megawatt capcity being built at Kalpakkam in Tamil Nadu. The fast breeder reactor uses thorium to create uranium 233 for power generation. A test reactor of the fast breeder type is already operating in Kalpakkam. Thorium is more abundantly found in India compared to uranium, for which the country has to rely on imports. India has seen opposition to nuclear power plants, especially the one at Kudankulam in southern Tamil Nadu. Many countries in Europe are moving away from nuclear energy citing its risks."
         
     
        
        
     
" The latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report has implored nations to act to reduce carbon emissions. Meanwhile, this Indian-origin scientist is part of the team working behind the scenes to establish the scientific modelling upon which IPCC’s claims are based. Dr V Balaji of Princeton University is also a laureate of the ‘Make our Planet Great Again’ programme initiated by French President Emmanuel Macron as a response to the United States leaving the Paris agreement. In an exclusive interview with the Hindustan Times, he talks about climate science, modelling systems and his views on how the Anthropocene age is unfolding. Q: Can you tell us what climate modelling is? A: Let’s first think about any scientific study, say you’re probing the link between smoking and lung cancer. The way you establish that link is: you compare a population of smokers against a population of non-smokers, and you look at the relative rates of cancer incidence. The populations must be alike in every other respect: each group has women and men, rich and poor, urban and rural, etc. If the rates of lung cancer are different, and no other factor other than smoking can explain it, the link is established. In the case of the planet, if you ask yourself what’s the effect of continually adding CO2 (carbon dioxide), you have a problem because there’s only one Earth. So, you build simulations, computer models of the Earth that resemble the real planet. Then you can do a similar experiment. The ‘smokers’ are the models where you subject them to heavy industrial pollution. The ‘non-smokers’ are the ones where you pretend that fossil fuel extraction never took place. Then you compare the temperatures and rainfall and so on. You will find that with CO2 the planet warms as observed since the Industrial Revolution, without CO2 it doesn’t. That’s what a climate model is: it’s a computer simulation where we put in everything we know about the natural processes in the atmosphere and ocean and biosphere. For the long-term changes, we play various political ‘scenarios’, ones where there is planetary scale action to control emissions and ones where people refuse to wean themselves off fossil fuels even as the effects of climate change are felt all around us. Climate models will tell us likely outcomes across these two different futures. Q: What is the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP)? A: The reason we believe these models is that we study them to see how well they resemble the real planet. Of course, being scientists, we don’t all agree and compete to build better simulations. The CMIP is a sort of Olympic Games of climate models, where every six years or so all the model builders engage in friendly competition to see whose model is best at different aspects of climate change, for instance around the Indian monsoon, or the disappearing Arctic ice. As a nice side benefit, the results also give you the best consensus across all the world’s experts on the state of the climate, what we are all collectively quite certain about, what we still need to study more, and these results are given to the world in the form of IPCC assessment reports. The sixth of these, CMIP6, is currently underway and we can expect to see the assessment IPCC-AR6 in 2021. The models are very expensive to run. A typical model runs on a supercomputer and we are constantly making them better. Think of it as a camera with an ever-improving zoom lens, these models are like that. Each generation gets to zoom in and see more details. For instance, now we can ‘see’ tropical cyclones directly in our models, and see whether they become stronger with climate change and whether there will be more or fewer. Q: Can you tell us about your work with regards to training in the use of climate models in developing nations? A: If you look at early IPCC reports, almost all the results came from American and European models. Of course, the models are of the whole planet: it’s all connected and winds and ocean currents go around the world and pole to pole, and you cannot study ‘American climate’ or ‘European climate’ in isolation. But still, people are most interested in results near them, so it’s understandable if an American scientist were more interested in sea level rise in New York and drought in California. What about the Indian monsoon, South African drought, other concerns of the developing world, who will study those? I left India a long time ago, but I have remained Indian ‘dil se’. I have close friends and colleagues in Indian institutions. A decade or more ago, I started bringing experts from around the world to India every few years to teach modelling, did workshops in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune. Also, after Nelson Mandela became president, a friend of mine, a great scientist, who was exiled during apartheid, went back and invited me to run a similar workshop in Cape Town. And I am proud to note (though I claim no credit, it is entirely the work of local scientists) that for the first time in CMIP6, there will be a South African and Indian model participating. Q: Would you like to talk about the recent IPCC report and the science behind its predictions? A: The 1.5 (degrees) Celsius target is an outcome of the Paris meeting of 2015. The IPCC went in with a 2-degree target and a group there, led by many island nations made a passionate case for 1.5 degrees that carried the day. This recent special report on the 1.5C target followed when the IPCC returned to the scientists and economists and asked, what would it take to get to 1.5C? The problem is that carbon stays for a long time in the atmosphere once emitted, so it’s a cumulative problem, and we are still paying the price for decades-old emissions. Every year you delay de-carbonization makes it less likely you will meet any target of survivable climate change. That is really the stark message of the report. We may eventually get to zero carbon or even negative emissions, but every year you wait to take action, you will increase the human and ecological cost. Q: Would you like to predict how the world is going to be, especially India, given the increase in extreme weather events in recent times."
        
                   
" For most of us, thinking about Lakshadweep islands conjures images of pristine beaches, clear blue seas and fascinating coral reefs that are home to a diversity of plant and animal life. This might not be far from reality but recent research questions how long will these serene islands remain the same. A nearly two-decade-long study by the Oceans and Coasts Program of the Nature Conservation Foundation’s (NCF) has found that the absolute coral cover in these islands has reduced from 51.6% in 1998 to 11% in 2017, a staggering 40% decline. They have found that the alarming rate of coral mortality and their shifting species compositions, combined with their slow rate of recovery, could severely limit their ability to resist future disturbances due to climate change. “The enormous drop in coral cover is a result of repeated and increasingly severe climate change-related disturbance,” says Shreya Yadav, who along with Teresa Alcoverro and Rohan Arthur published their findings in the journal Coral Reefs earlier this month. “By monitoring the same reefs since 1998 through a series of El Niño disturbance events, we found that the way a single reef responds to and recovers from a stressor can change drastically through time,” Yadav says. “Reefs are infamously complex and dynamic systems, but our study shows that in the Lakshadweep, a changing community of corals in a warming environment has led to a four-fold drop in recovery rates since 1998,” she adds. Death by El Niño Over their research period, the team monitored six reefs across three islands to find out answers for two questions. How resistant the reefs were to climatic anomalies? And, how well did they recover from them? The Lakshadweep islands are an archipelago of 36 atolls - ring-shaped reef, island, or a chain of islands formed of coral - in the eastern Indian Ocean, off the south-west coast of India. They found that El Niño events, sudden increases in ocean temperatures that kill large tracts of coral, are occurring more regularly than ever before. Three mass bleachings of corals have been witnessed in the islands in the last 20 years, in 1998, 2010 and 2016 respectively. “Each of this was linked to an El Niño current, and each was of a higher intensity than the previous one,” says Arthur, the senior author of the paper. “The good news is that with every subsequent El Niño event, less coral is dying—the reefs are becoming more resistant. The bad news is that their ability to recover from each event has declined dramatically. The even worse news is that the frequency of these disturbance events is increasing all the time—killing the reef before it is able to limp back to health again,” he adds. As they state in their paper, “The structural and functional consequences of these losses can have far-reaching effects. In addition to an absolute loss in coral cover, shifts to stress-tolerant, structurally simpler species could result in smaller colonies and flatter reefs, resulting in a loss of critical habitat for fish and invertebrates that depend on the structure.” This is also having adverse consequences on the 70,000 people who live on the island, most of whose livelihood is fishing. “As complex and life-giving as they are, corals are also extremely sensitive to changes in temperature. Raise the temperature just a little over what is normal for the time of year, and they expel the algae they depend on—turning a deathly white as they lose their colour—and their main source of food. Without the algae, bleached coral are way more vulnerable to disease and death,” Arthur says. What has alarmed the researchers most is the speed at which coral life is being destroyed. “Increases in sea surface temperature were once a decadal event. When they happened, the ecosystem had enough time to heal from it. In the last 20 years, something seems to be broken in the circulatory system of the ocean,” says Yadav. A sliver of hope While the overall findings indicate that the Lakshadweep islands are facing full frontal assault due to climate change, there are small slivers of hope to hang onto. “We also found that the amount of coral death following each disturbance event has been declining since 1998. This is because a more resistant community of corals now dominates these reefs,” Yadav says. “But while these species are more adapted to warm waters, this comes at a cost - they do not grow very fast, and the shapes and forms they grow in do not always provide the kind of habitat required for many coral-dependent fish,” she adds. The need of the hour to tackle this decline before it has even more disastrous consequences for India seems to be more research and collaboration. “Corals are the harbingers of climate change and this study gives us profound insights into how the coral reef ecosystems of Lakshadweep are responding to climate change impacts,” Naveen Namboothri, a marine biologist at the Dakshin Foundation who has worked on coral reef ecology in the Andamans, says."
" The Special Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the implications of a 1.5 degrees C rise in average global temperature, which was released on October 8, 2018, confirmed what we have known for years but stubbornly ignored. Climate change from human-induced causes is already taking place and is both accelerating and intensifying. Average global temperatures have risen about 1 degree C since the start of the Industrial Revolution and, the report says: “We are already seeing the consequences... through more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice, among other changes.” Even if the temperature rise could be limited to the current level, these observed climate changes would not only continue but will intensify because of strong feedback loops. The Earth’s ecosystem is a dynamic one. A derangement in one variable feeds into derangement in another, causing a cascading series of changes throughout the ecosystem. Further temperature rise, even of 1.5 degrees C, may result in catastrophic and irreversible changes. I believe that the IPCC report is unusually optimistic in positing a relatively benign outcome with a 1.5 degrees C temperature rise. The report presents a striking example of impending disaster — at 1.5 degrees C temperature rise, 70-90% of coral reefs across the world would die. At 2 degrees C rise, none would be left. But is a loss of 70-90% of coral reefs somehow less of a disaster? What has been happening with just a one degree temperature rise so far has been conveyed in stark terms in the report. What has not been spelt out clearly is that even if there were no further increases in temperature, there will still be rising intensity of the negative consequences, which we are already experiencing. A one degree hotter planet is not a steady state. True, as the report states, the planet will be less at risk with a 1.5 degrees C temperature rise than with a 2 degrees C rise but that deflects from the reality that we are already in deep trouble. Why is a one degree hotter planet not a steady state? The answer lies in the dense interconnectedness of all life on Earth and the strong feedback loops which link the entire ecosystem. Global warming so far may have led to the loss of over 40-50% of the coral reefs , but the damage does not stop there. The loss of corals affects marine life as they provide habitat for fish. Their loss makes coasts more vulnerable to wave erosion because they act as wave breakers. The loss of fish populations will have an impact on food security which, in turn, affects human health. All these then have second order effects which escape reckoning. The report has pointed out that while average global temperature may rise by 1 degree C, there are parts of the planet which are already past the 2 degrees C threshold. Arctic temperature has risen by 3 degrees C. This is not only leading to a loss of ice at an alarming rate but also affecting ocean currents, ocean chemistry and weather patterns. A warmer Arctic Ocean is leading to the steady loss of the ice sheets covering Greenland and the perma-frost areas in the northern parts of the Arctic littoral. Once these ancient stores of ice begin to melt, they will release vast quantities of methane that lie locked in the ice. Methane is several times more temperature forcing than carbon dioxide. We may already be in the middle of this dynamic and the consequences will be planet wide. Each phenomenon may appear as a crisis in a particular domain or a particular location but the reality is that our planet’s ecosystem is one single domain, one single location. Our current knowledge systems progress through increasing categorisation, identification and study of individual phenomenon. This abstraction has advantages but in the process the larger picture, the awareness that there are myriad threads which bind the planet’s ecosystem, is obscured. The true scale of the challenge that humanity faces, here and now, not in some distant future, has been apparent for some time but there is a collective blindness which compels us to pretend that all will be well. The reasons for this are clear. Acknowledging the true enormity of the challenge we are confronted with will demand that we alter our lifestyles, change our value systems and re-connect humanity with Nature: Man in Nature, not Man Against Nature. There is also the influence of boundless techno-optimism that leads us to believe that before disaster strikes, the wonders of technology such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, quantum computing and geo-engineering will be able to find answers to the dilemma we face today without our having to alter the patterns of living we are attached to. This is a delusion. There are no technical fixes to deal with the scale and rapidity of ecological change. The IPCC report acknowledges that “the pathways to avoiding an even hotter world would require a swift and complete transformation not just of the global economy but of society too”. This will only be possible if the world is able to reject resurgent nationalism and parochialism and adopt collective and collaborative responses to this crisis. India’s civilisational attributes, which lie obscured, point us in the right direction but await being rekindled by a far-sighted leadership imbued with an internationalist spirit.

" On October 8, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an international body for assessing the science related to climate change, released its landmark report on climate change at a special meeting in South Korea. The report is a scientific guide for government policymakers on how to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to limit the rise in global average temperatures to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels, while seeking to tighten the goal to 1.5C. Meeting the 1.5C limit would demand “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented change in all aspects of society”, the panel said. Temperatures would be 1.5C higher between 2030 and 2052 if the world continues at its current pace, it warned. Even if we achieve the Paris Agreement target, a 2C rise in temperature will have an unprecedented impact on fauna and flora, including encroachment of boreal fauna into the tundra region. Similarly, marine species will shift to higher latitudes and the global tree lines to higher altitudes. With this kind of global warming, 18% of insects, 16% of plants and 8% of vertebrates will lose more than half of their ranges worldwide. The grimness of the situation can be gauged from the fact that we have set in motion, the sixth and the greatest mass extinction ever witnessed in the history of Earth. One of the most striking claims by the IPCC report is about the loss of coral reefs. Despite occupying only 0.1% of the ocean’s area, coral reefs support about one-fourth of marine species in the world. About 500 million people in the world are dependent on them for food and fisheries (Underwater Earth 2015). The corals ---- Charles Darwin defined them as “oasis in the desert of the ocean” ---- have an extensive presence along India’s vast coastline. Even in the best case scenario of achieving the Paris Agreement target, the world would still be losing about 70-90% of the corals. And if the rise is 2 degree celsius, we will lose almost all of the world’s coral. In the last two decades, corals have been dying due to bleaching, wherein they turn pale since they can’t support the algae population. This has been happening due to various factors: increased temperature of oceans, excessive surface runoff, overfishing, and oil spills or natural phenomenon like El Nino, to name a few. Clive Wilkinson of the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network says 10% of the Earth’s coral reefs have been reduced to skeletons, another 30% are in a critical condition and a further 30 are under severe environmental stress. Preliminary assessments indicate that the Indian Ocean is the most severely impacted region. More than 70% mortality has been observed off the coasts of Kenya, the Maldives, the Andamans and the Lakshwadweep islands. And about 75% of the corals have been reported to be dead in the Seychelles Marine Park System and the Mafia Marine Plant off Tanzania, says Wilkinson. The Wilkinson report also proved that corals were one of the first ecosystems to be affected by global warming. Other ecosystems will also be affected if the march of climate change continues unabated. Adequate mitigation and adaptation measures must be put in place to arrest such effects of climate change on human ecosystems. We must devise policies to provide protection to existing carbon sinks such as corals along with developing an adaptation frameworks for others. Reducing emissions will be critical here. This mean increasing electricity generation from the renewable sources from 20% (2018) to 70 to 85% by 2050 rather than depend on the artificial removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which will not only require huge finances but the possibility of a leak of the sequestered carbon will always be there.

" A potent combination of hunger, climate change and man-made conflicts are creating a “perfect storm”, the head of the UN’s food arm warned Tuesday in a call to action on World Food Day. “You’ve got a nightmare, the perfect storm heading your way,” David Beasley, World Food Programme (WFP) chief, said in a speech in Rome, where the United Nations’ food agencies are headquartered. The UN aims to achieve a Zero Hunger world by 2030, but faces three obstacles: conflicts, climate change and an economic slowdown. Beasley said the battle was an urgent one. “Children are dying at a rate of every five to ten seconds” from hunger or malnutrition, he said. Food is being wasted both during the production process and in people’s kitchens. “The answer is not in Rome alone, it’s in your homes. What are you going to do about it?” he asked. It is not a problem wealthier countries can simply ignore, for it has a knock-on effect on them in terms of the migration crisis. “For every one percent increase in hunger, there’s a two percent increase in migration,” Beasley said. Some 821 million people, or one of every nine people on the planet, suffered from hunger last year, marking the third consecutive annual increase, according to the UN’s latest hunger report. An estimated 155 million children under five years old are chronically malnourished, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), while micronutrient deficiencies, dubbed the “hidden hunger”, affects over two billion people worldwide. At the same time, over 600 million people are obese. The costs to society of the “global pandemic” of obesity are enormous -- as expensive as armed conflicts and smoking, FAO head Jose Graziano da Silva said. “International solidarity appears to be cooling,” warned Pope Francis in a speech delivered by a Vatican representative. He warned institutions leading the fight against hunger not to “study the roots of (poor people’s) misery” and merely respond with “impressive publications destined only to enlarge library catalogues”. “When it is a question of effectively confronting the causes of hunger, grandiose declarations” are not enough, he said."
" President Donald Trump is backing off his claim that climate change is a hoax but says he doesn’t know if it’s manmade and suggests that the climate will “change back again.” In an interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes” that aired Sunday night, Trump said he doesn’t want to put the U.S. at a disadvantage in responding to climate change. “I think something’s happening. Something’s changing and it’ll change back again,” he said. “I don’t think it’s a hoax. I think there’s probably a difference. But I don’t know that it’s manmade. I will say this: I don’t want to give trillions and trillions of dollars. I don’t want to lose millions and millions of jobs.” Trump called climate change a hoax in November 2012 when he sent a tweet stating, “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive.” He later said he was joking about the Chinese connection, but in years since has continued to call global warming a hoax. “I’m not denying climate change,” he said in the interview. “But it could very well go back. You know, we’re talking about over a ... millions of years.” As far as the climate “changing back,” temperature records kept by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration show that the world hasn’t had a cooler-than-average year since 1976 or a cooler-than-normal month since the end of 1985. Trump, who is scheduled on Monday to visit areas of Georgia and Florida damaged by Hurricane Michael, also expressed doubt over scientists’ findings linking the changing climate to more powerful hurricanes. “They say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just had with Michael,” said Trump, who identified “they” as “people” after being pressed by “60 Minutes” correspondent Leslie Stahl. She asked, “What about the scientists who say it’s worse than ever?” the president replied, “You’d have to show me the scientists because they have a very big political agenda.” Trump’s comments came just days after a Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a warning that global warming would increase climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security and economic growth. The report detailed how Earth’s weather, health and ecosystems would be in better shape if the world’s leaders could somehow limit future human-caused warming. Citing concerns about the pact’s economic impact, Trump said in 2017 that the U.S. will leave the Paris climate accord. The agreement set voluntary greenhouse gas emission targets in an effort to lessen the impact of fossil fuels. On a different topic, Trump told “60 Minutes” that he’s been surprised by Washington being a tough, deceptive and divisive place, though some accuse the real estate mogul elected president of those same tactics. “So I always used to say the toughest people are Manhattan real estate guys and blah, blah,” he said. “Now I say they’re babies.” He said the political people in Washington have changed his thinking."
" The air quality in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) deteriorated to hazardous levels due to stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana in the last few days. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi on Saturday afternoon was 300, news agency PTI reported. An AQI between the range of 51 to 100 is considered as satisfactory, 101-200 is moderate, 201-300 comes under the poor category, whereas 401-500 range is severe. Adjoining Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon and Noida also recorded ‘very poor’ air quality levels, the data by the Central Pollution Control Board showed. The PM10 level (presence of particles with diameter less than 10 micrometres) in Delhi stood at 243 and the PM2.5 level was recorded at 122, according to the data. Meanwhile, recent satellite images from the NASA have showed that the farmers in Punjab and Haryana have started burning crop residue earlier this month. The NASA, on its official website, stated that burning crop residue in Punjab and Haryana has increased significantly over the past 10 days in and near Amritsar, Ambala, Karnal, Sirsa and Hisar. Burning of paddy straw every year during October and November and wheat straw during April in Punjab and Haryana are the major contributors of air pollution in Delhi-NCR, as the smoke travels towards the national capital. In Delhi, it mixes with the fog and creates a toxic smoggy winter every year. Doctors have warned that stubble burning would lead to respiratory diseases like tuberculosis. “People must stay indoors and those who go out must wear N-95 masks,” Ravi Wankhedkar president of Indian Medical Association said, according to ANI. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday alleged that “no concrete action” has been taken by the Centre, governments of Haryana and Punjab on stubble burning despite Delhi pursuing the issue with them. He expressed apprehension that as the winters were approaching the entire region, including Delhi, will again become the “gas chamber” and the people will face “difficulty in breathing”. Apart from Delhi, toxic air affected Mumbai too, with a haze enveloping the maximum city’s skyline for the second day on Saturday. Mumbai’s AQI was 175, which is quite high according to its standards, and is expected to get worse. Over the last few decades, scientists from around the world have been warning of rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels. This, in turn, adversely affects the climate, leading to ocean acidity and the frequency of freak weather. The latest report circulated on October 8 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has predicted that if climatic change continues for next several years, then people will be at a greater risk of injury, disease and even death due to more intense heat waves and fires. The climate change has also adversely affected the snow-laden peaks and landscapes of Himachal Pradesh. The untimely snowfall in Lahul Spiti which is at least 3000 metres above the sea level, has resulted in the loss of crops such as cabbage, apple, potatoes etc. This area usually receives a heavy snowfall between December and April."
" Forest fires in India might increase in the coming days because of extreme weather patterns triggered by climate change, warns a report by the Union environment ministry and the World Bank. It shows 20 districts in central India accounted for 48% of the total area burnt by forest fires between 2003 and 2016. Around 44% of the forest fires, which mostly include smaller fires linked to jhum cultivation, or slash and burn agriculture, occurred in another 20 districts in that time period, primarily in the north-eastern states that represent 3% of India’s land area, says the report titled ‘Strengthening Forest Fire Management in India’. It was released by environment minister Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday. In a separate event earlier in the day, Vardhan said action plans on climate change, conceptualised about a decade ago, were being revised taking into account the current realities of global warming.   In a recent report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a global body set up in 1988, has said fires in moist tropical forests are becoming more frequent and severe. Dry tropical forests are increasingly under pressure from climate change, deforestation, fragmentation and fire. “One study of the effects of climate change on tropical dry forests in South Asia cited by IPCC, for example, finds that by the end of this century most of India’s dry forests are projected to experience climate conditions beyond the envelope that they can tolerate,” says the report on forest fires. It uses National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) data to identify regional patterns. Fires in the north-east, associated with jhum, are found to be concentrated and cyclical in nature, while those in central India are more expansive. The report identifies weather, climate change-induced extremities, topography and people as the main causes of forest fires. The dryness of soil and heat too are important triggers. Dry and moist deciduous forests in the borderlands of Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Telangana are affected by fires every year, says the report. Parts of the western Himalayas, such as Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh that experienced severe forest fires in 2016, account for a smaller share of burnt area in comparison with central India. Vardhan said only an “aggressive strategy” can control forest fires that cause an annual loss of about ₹1,101 crore. District-level analyses for data from 2003 to 2016 also show that the monsoon can give an early warning of severity of the next year’s fire. A district that experiences slightly higher rainfall than its long-term average during the monsoon is likely to experience fewer fires the following year. Forest officers in 11 states, interviewed by the authors of the report, agree that humans cause the most number of forest fires, with negligence and the collection of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Telangana being the catalysts."
   
              
        
" Countries have to make unprecedented transitions in all sectors to avoid devastating consequences of climate change and keep global warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels this century, says a report by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an international body set up in 1988. Commitments to cutting down carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, submitted by 195 nations under the Paris agreement, will fail to keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5°C of pre-industrial age levels, says the report released in South Korea’s Incheon on Monday. If that happens, India may face serious consequences, including severe heat-stress in big cities and high air pollution levels, saltwater intrusion in coastal areas triggered by rise in sea levels and increased vulnerability to disasters in high mountain ecosystems, according to experts. But even a 1.5°C rise in temperature will be threatening to India. In December 2015, as many as 195 countries reached an agreement in Paris to combat climate change and accelerate and intensify actions and investments needed for a sustainable low-carbon future. IPCC’s special report titled ‘Global Warming of 1.5 Degrees’ finds that nations will require “rapid and far-reaching” transitions in all sectors, particularly energy, land use, industry, transport, buildings and other infrastructure to fight climate change. Developing nations and least developed countries have been asking developed nations, particularly the US, to take historical and moral responsibility for being one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters. Smaller nations have asked for equity in CO2 emission cuts to curb global warming, a time frame and funding from developed nations for climate change mitigation. The US has been resisting large cuts in CO2 emissions. In 2017, the Donald Trump administration said it will withdraw from the Paris agreement but it cannot do that before 2020 according to the terms of the agreement. An author of the recent report, who spoke on condition of anonymity, says the US red-flagged several findings of the scientific summary for policymakers, but finally all nations endorsed it. Global net human-caused CO2 emissions would need to fall by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching ‘net zero’ around 2050, says the report. “This means that any remaining emissions would need to be balanced by removing CO2 from the air,” it says. But IPCC also adds that the effectiveness of CO2-capturing technologies is still unproven on a large-scale. The report, drafted by 91 authors from 40 countries, finds that even if Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), or commitments made by nations under the Paris agreement, are “supplemented by very challenging increases in the scale and ambition of emissions reductions after 2030,” it may not be enough to stop more than 1.5°C rise in temperatures. “Limiting warming to 1.5ºC is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics but doing so would require unprecedented changes,” says Jim Skea, co-chair of IPCC Working Group III, which worked on the report. M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences (MoES), says, “It’s a difficult target that requires all countries to come on board and make unprecedented changes but it’s not impossible.” The consequences of a 1.5°C rise include extreme temperatures in many regions across the world, increases in frequency, intensity and/or amount of heavy precipitation, and an increase in intensity or frequency of droughts in some regions. With a 2°C rise, the impacts can be too serious for communities to adapt. For example, according to IPCC, by 2100 global sea level rise would be 10 cm lower in case of a 1.5°C rise compared with a 2°C rise. The likelihood of an Arctic Ocean free of sea ice in summer would be once per century with global warming of 1.5°C, compared with at least once per decade with 2°C. Global warming of 1.5°C may force many marine species to relocate to higher altitudes and deal a blow to many ecosystems. “It is also expected to drive the loss of coastal resources, and reduce the productivity of aquaculture,” the report says. India’s Vulnerability The IPCC report doesn’t list country-wise impacts. But several studies conclude that India is vulnerable to climate change impacts. Joyashree Roy, a professor of economics at Jadavpur University and a co-author of the IPCC report, says: “We have found that the burden of global warming will fall disproportionately on the poor who are not responsible for the problem if we don’t meet (the) 1.5 degrees target. The most-affected areas in India will be mega cities, coastal areas, high-mountain and small-island regions. There will also be heat stress in cities and air quality will deteriorate due to high fossil fuel use.” NH Ravindranath, of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), who has been an IPCC author and specialises in forestry, says, “Climate change is already impacting natural ecosystems and socio-economic systems even at current level of warming of 1°C.” He adds that “the impacts of climatic change hazards (like droughts, floods, etc.) will depend on the exposure (population in coastal zones, drought- and flood-prone areas and mountain slopes). Since India has a very large population and regions subjected to droughts, floods, and sea level rise, it is one of the most-vulnerable countries.” Rajeevan says India is already experiencing extreme weather events; the unprecedented rains that triggered this year’s Kerala floods being an example. Chandra Bhushan, the deputy director general of Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), says, “Though it will be very difficult in the current global economic system to limit warming to 1.5°C, it is not impossible. This will require acting on all fronts to rapidly reduce emissions by 2030. Without an active participation of the US, this will be impossible. In totality, how the rest of the world handles the climate rogue behaviour of the Trump administration will decide whether the world meets the 1.5°C goal or not.” Asked about reports of the US stand on the crucial report, AK Mehta, an additional secretary at the environment ministry, says, “India recognises climate change to be a real threat and we will do whatever we can in our own capacity. Denying the reality of climate change is not going to help anyone. ”"
             
  
                
             
                            
" Temperatures are likely to rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2030 and 2052 if global warming continues at its current pace and if the world fails to take rapid and unprecedented measures to stem the increase, a UN report said on Monday. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) met last week in Incheon, South Korea to finalise the report, prepared at the request of governments in 2015 when a global pact to tackle climate change was agreed. The report is seen as the main scientific guide for government policymakers on how to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement. The Paris pact aims to limit global average temperature rise to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels, while seeking to tighten the goal to 1.5C. There has already been a rise of 1C since the mid-1800s as industrialisation lifted emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main greenhouse gas blamed for climate change. A rise of 1.5C would still carry climate-related risks for nature and mankind but the risks would be lower than a rise of 2C, the report summary said. Meeting the 1.5C limit required “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented” change in land and energy use, industry, buildings, transport and cities, it said, adding temperatures would be 1.5C higher between 2030 and 2052 at the current pace. The targets agreed in Paris on cutting emissions would not be enough even if there were larger and more ambitious cuts after 2030, it said. To contain warming at 1.5C, manmade global net carbon dioxide emissions would need to fall by about 45 percent by 2030 from 2010 levels and reach “net zero” by mid-century. Any additional emissions would require removing CO2 from the air. “Limiting warming to 1.5C is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics but doing so would require unprecedented changes,” said Jim Skea, co-chair of the IPCC working group which assesses climate change mitigation. Unprecedented change The summary said renewable energy would need to supply 70 to 85 percent of electricity by 2050 to stay within a 1.5C limit, compared with about 25 percent now. Using carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, the share of gas-fired power would need to be cut to 8 percent and coal to between 0 and 2 percent. There was no mention of oil in this context in the summary. If the average global temperature temporarily exceeded 1.5C, additional carbon removal techniques would be required to return warming to below 1.5C by 2100. But the report said the efficacy of measures, such as planting forests, bioenergy use or capturing and storing CO2, were unproven at a large scale and carried some risks. Steps like reflecting incoming solar radiation back into space were not assessed because of the uncertainties about using such technology, the report said. It said keeping the rise in temperature to 1.5C would mean sea levels by 2100 would be 10 cm lower than if the warming was 2C, the likelihood of an Arctic Ocean free of sea ice in summer would be once per century not at least once a decade, and coral reefs would decline by 70-90 percent instead of being virtually wiped out."
            
                           
               
           
        
            
          
" External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj’s speech at the UNGA on Saturday focused on two primary issues – terrorism and climate change. While Swaraj stressed on how there is a need for developed nations needs to uplift the underdeveloped ones to witness a substantial progress in climate change, the foreign minister directly attacked Pakistan on the issue of terrorism. Here is the full text of her speech at UNGA: Your Excellency Madame President, May I begin by congratulating you on your election as the President of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, on my personal behalf as well as on behalf of my country, India. As a woman, I feel doubly proud that you have this honour. I also recall, with equal pride, that the first woman to occupy this eminent chair was an Indian Smt. Vijayalakshmi Pandit, in 1953 during the 8th session. I will also like to thank the outgoing President Mr. Miroslav Lajcak for successfully conducting the 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly. Madame President, we received a very bad news this morning that there was an earthquake and tsunami- both these tragedies occurred at the same time - and from this forum on behalf of my country India I would like to express deep condolences to the people and government of Indonesia and at the same time I would like to express assurance that India will cooperate in helping during this tragic time. Madame President, The United Nations is the world’s premier multilateral organization: 1: where nations seek balm for the wounds of history, and a platform for solutions. 2: where less developed nations sit with their more fortunate brethren to formulate plans that can correct the skewered economic imbalance. 3: where new goals are set, and route maps defined, to make our world a better place. In 2015, we established 2030 as a critically important horizon for 17 Sustainable Development Goals. A common refrain, from 2015, has been that we will reach that horizon only if India finds its way to this destination. Otherwise, we shall fail. I assure this august gathering through you, Madam, that India will not let you fail. We are totally committed to achieving these objectives for our own people. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has initiated unprecedented economic and social transformation that will help India achieve its SDG goals much before time. Let me offer a few glimpses of evidence to illustrate what is the world’s biggest exercise in poverty elimination and social transformation: Through the Jan Dhan Yojana, world’s largest financial inclusion scheme, over 320 million Indians, who had never crossed the door of a bank before, now have bank accounts. This has enabled the poor to receive allotments from the government’s welfare programmes into their personal accounts, through Direct Benefit Transfer, which has ended waste and corruption in the system. Similarly, Ayushman Bharat, the world’s biggest health insurance programme, was launched by Prime Minister Modi a few days ago on 23rd September. This revolutionary scheme will benefit 500 million Indians, who will get an insurance cover of ₹500,000 per family per year. We have a prayer in India: Sarve Santu Niramaya, which means, all should be healthy. The Aayushman Bharat Yojana is the answer to this prayer. Similarly, we have launched the largest housing scheme in the world aimed at ensuring that everyone has a roof above their heads. Under the scheme, we have set ourselves a target of nealy 21 million homes by 2022. So far, over five million homes for the poor have already been constructed. Similarly, two extremely effective schemes have been initiated to raise the skill levels of those waiting to be employed through Skill Development Programme and to turn the poor into entrepreneurs, through the Mudra Programme. I want to stress that over 140 million Indians have taken Mudra loans. The most significant aspect of Mudra scheme is that 76% of the beneficiaries are women. At the heart of Prime Minister Modi’s transformative vision is a radical idea: that the uplift of any nation is best achieved through the all-round empowerment of women. All the schemes that I have just spoken about have the welfare of women at their core. Last year, I spoke about the Ujjawala scheme, in which I am happy to report 50 million free gas connections have been provided so far. Another such initiative is the Maternity Benefit Scheme, in which women get 26 weeks of paid leave to care for their newborn. Madame President, as a woman, you will understand better than most how vitally important this programme is for every mother. Some developed nations with huge economies do not offer more than six weeks paid leave, leading to a continuing struggle for more time off. In India, we have implemented what women across the world need. Madam President In 2022, free India will be 75 years old. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to build a New India by then. This New India will be: 1: Swachh Bharat, Swasth Bharat (Clean India, Healthy India);                                    "
" India has told the United Nations it is willing to  take the lead in combating climate change, saying its commitment is rooted in history and ethos and current plans and the vision for the future. External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj made the offer at a climate change event hosed on Wednesday by UN secretary general Antonio Gueterres, within hours of a UN body naming Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron joint winners of one of the world body’s top six environment honours called Champions of the Earth. “India is willing to take the lead in climate action,” Swaraj said. “Our commitment to combat climate change is rooted in our ethos, which considers the Earth as mother.” India is the world’s sixth largest producer of renewable energy, and the fifth largest producer of solar energy, Swaraj cited  as evidence of India’s commitment, and went on to detail her government’s plans to generate 175 gigawatts of solar and wind energy by 2022.  “We have installed over 300 million LED bulbs, saving US$2 billion and 4 GW of electricity,” she said, and mentioned Kochi airport, the world’s first solar-powered airport. It is among seven entities named as winners of  the Champions of the Earth awards. Swaraj reiterated India’s commitment to meeting the emission reduction target it set for itself under the 2015 Paris Accord — to cut emissions intensity of GDP by 25% below 2005 levels by 2020, and further by 33-35% by 2030. India is among the countries that came out early in support of the accord when it was jolted briefly by the exit of the US in the early days of the Trump administration. The accord remains in force with China, France and all other countries determined to preserve a hard-fought consensus. The US is the only country out of it now, after Syria, the only other holdout, joined late in 2017. Swaraj spoke at length about the International Solar Alliance (ISA), an initiative launched jointly by India and France during the signing of the Paris Accord, which is working towards mobilising solar technology and lowering prices — 68 countries have signed on already. India is hosting the inaugural meeting of its general assembly next week. India discussed the extradition of fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi with Antigua and Barbuda in bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and sternly reminded third-party entities such as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) they had no “locus standi” on Kashmir. The 53-member OIC’s contact group on Kashmir, which met in New York on Wednesday, heard a presentation by Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and renewed its call for self-determination for Kashmir. It also sought a UN probe into alleged rights abuses. India regrets “that a matter which is very internal to Indian affairs was again discussed at the OIC”, external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar told a news briefing. “We reject such references ... (and as) we have said in the past, OIC has no locus standi to comment on internal affairs of India.”"
" Carbon dioxide emissions are costing the Indian economy up to US $210 billion every year, according to a global study which found that the country is likely to suffer highest economic damage from climate change after the US. Previous research has focused on how rich countries benefit from the fossil fuel economy, while damages accrue primarily to the developing world. However, researchers from University of California San Diego in the US found that the top three counties with the most to lose from climate change are US, India and Saudi Arabia. “The economic damages model indicates that as temperature rises, economic growth in India will slow,” Katharine Ricke, an assistant professor at UC San Diego, told PTI. Researchers estimated country-level contributions to the social cost of carbon (SCC) using recent climate model projections, empirical climate-driven economic damage estimations and socioeconomic forecasts. The country-level SCC for the India alone is estimated to be about US $86 per tonne of CO2. At current emission levels, the Indian economy loses US $210 billion annually, said Ricke, corresponding author of the study published in the journal Nature Climate Change. For US, the cost is about US $50 billion per tonne. This means that the nearly five billion metric tonnes of CO2 the US emits each year is costing the US economy about US $250 billion. The model accounts for everything that happens in the economy today that is sensitive to environmental conditions, said Ricke. “This includes agricultural yields, vector borne disease, reduced worker productivity due to heat, increased frequency of extreme precipitation resulting in infrastructure damages or any of the other many ways that human systems get impacted by climate conditions,” Ricke added. “The combination and interaction of all these factors translate into an observed effect on the country’s economy as a whole,” she said. For the first time, researchers have developed a data set quantifying what the social cost of carbon will be for the globe’s nearly 200 countries. The world’s largest CO2 emitter, China, also places in the top five countries with the highest losses. “We all know carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels affects people and ecosystems around the world, today and in the future,” said Ricke. “However these impacts are not included in market prices, creating an environmental externality whereby consumers of fossil fuel energy do not pay for and are unaware of the true costs of their consumption,” said Ricke. For example, claims that carbon dioxide causes relatively little harm to the economy can more easily justify rollbacks on environmental regulation. “Because this is a macroeconomic model based on empirical observations, this means that everything that happens in the economy today that is sensitive to environmental conditions is reflected in the model,” she said."
  
        
             
" India is set to roll out its most integrated programme yet to cut greenhouse gases from agriculture. The project is primarily aimed at protecting the country’s five biggest vulnerable ecological landscapes, according to a two officials familiar with the matter. The programme will cover Madhya Pradesh’s Chambal region, Dampa in Mizoram, Odisha’s Similipal, Jaisalmer and Barmer in Rajasthan besides a national wildlife corridor through Uttarakhand, the officials said. The programme, involving the agriculture and environment ministries, is part of a global initiative of the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF), a partnership 183 countries, including India. Each of these critical biodiversity zones – home to over a third of India’s 300 million tribals, precious wildlife and forests – face a specific threat from unsustainable agriculture, including large-scale land degradation. Climate change and agriculture have a two-way relationship. Farming contributes to and is adversely impacted by climate change, according to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The goal of the project, with a run period 2018-2025, is to “sequestrate” 49.9 million tonnes of carbon gasses through improved agro-ecosystems. Carbon sequestration refers to the process of offsetting harmful emissions through mitigation. “The programme will serve like one national platform to integrate various ongoing schemes for sustainable agriculture,” said agriculture ministry joint secretary Alka Bhargava. Agriculture activities are widely known to emit three kinds of harmful gases: carbon dioxide from soil cultivation, methane from livestock and nitrous oxide from fertilizers. Greenhouse emissions are a significant driver of climate change by trapping heat in the Earth’s atmosphere and causing global warming, according to FAO. In the Chambal region, an area covering 97,982 hectares, the main threats include expanding ravines, sparse vegetation and pollution from chemical-runoffs from agriculture, an official document states. Mitigation proposals include organic cultivation and sustainable grazing of cattle. In Mizoram, the project will span the Dampa Tiger Reserve and the Thorangtlang Wildlife Sanctuary, covering 145,670 hectares in the Lunglei and Mamit regions. Jhum cultivation has been a major threat to land degradation in the state. In Odisha, the project will be spread over 556,900 hectares, including the UNESCO recognized Simlipal Biosphere Reserve. Jaisalmer and Barmer in Rajasthan have been picked to create an ecologically sustainable “Desert National Park”, spanning 316,200 hectares. In Uttarakhand, the Corbett Tiger Reserve and the Rajaji Tiger Reserve will be covered, spanning 324,696 hectares in Nainital, Pauri Garhwal, Almora, Dehradun and Haridwar districts. “The main idea behind the programme is to integrate environmental concerns with agricultural practices and policies,” said Jeffrey Griffin of FAO."
         
" A study conducted by Dehradun based Wildlife Institute of India (WII) shows that farming of 30 traditional crops has been abandoned in Pithoragarh district in last one decade due to climate change and migration. An ongoing study ‘Conservation of indigenous crop varieties and vulnerability assessment of agro-ecosystem in Pithoragarh district’ reported how agricultural land use has declined to 19% in last one decade along with an overall decline of 28% in the area of cultivation in the district. As per the study, over 70% farmers in the district abandoned farming of Foxtail millet, locally called Koni. Nearly 27% farmers abandoned farming Flaxseed or Alsi and 26% abandoned Barnyard millet, also called Madira. The study was based on questionnaire conducted across 31 villages in four administrative blocks. “The major reason for such decline is that farmers no longer perceive the traditional agriculture in the hills as profitable. The outcome of climate change such as delayed monsoon, erratic rainfall, low snow fall, monsoon failure are further adding to the crop failures and discouraging farmers to continue investing on agriculture,” Nehru Prabakaran, faculty at WII working on the project, said. The agriculture in the district, which shares border with Nepal and China, is mainly rain-fed and is driven by subsistence rather than economy.  “Migration of the young generation in search of better economic options have reduced the human workforce required for the arduous agricultural operations in the hilly terrain. Also, the increased incidents of crop depredation by wildlife, mostly due to the degradation of traditional practices have contributed to further decline in the farming sector,” he added. Another important reason behind abandoning farming of traditional crops is the change in food habits. Cereals and pulses have been replaced with rice and wheat, that constitute the main diet of the people in the region. “In the earlier generation, people in the Himalayan region were known to include variety of millets in their diet. When rice and wheat become a major part of the diet, people’s interest in millet slowly began to declined. For example, the Madua roti, once common in the hills, are now seldom consumed by the locals. Therefore, most of the minor crops and millets are fast disappearing from the hill agriculture,” GS Rawat, dean and principal investigator of the research, said."
" The ancients believed that good sex ensured a stable marriage, a stable marriage ensured a stable society, and a stable society meant a stable kingdom. To illustrate this, here is an apocryphal story from the 13th century, set in an eastern kingdom in India. A king was sitting with his ministers when a naked woman ran into the court. The scandalised ministers rushed forward to clothe her, but she stopped them. “I am fed up,” she said. “I have always made sure to fully pleasure all my lovers, but no man has ever taken the trouble to satisfy me completely. And I have decided that until a man is able to satisfy me fully I will not get dressed again.” The ministers fell into panic. Suppose this became the fashion? Suppose all their wives took to the streets naked because they were dissatisfied in bed? The king realised he would have to do something. He could see that his ministers were no longer thinking about the welfare of his people or the security of his borders – just the naked woman and the kind of rebellion she might incite. He called for any man who could help. For a while it seemed hopeless, but eventually a man came forward. He led the woman away, and lo and behold, she returned to court the next morning fully clothed! The delighted king told the man to write a book on his knowledge of how to satisfy a woman completely. Because never again did he want his kingdom or his people to fall into this kind of uncertainty. The ultimate panacea Over the centuries, the wise and the sagacious have consistently recommended great sex as the panacea for most ills. The Chinese considered it the elixir of youth and the path to glowing skin. According to the Sushruta Samhita, a sixth century text on Ayurveda, different sexual positions could be used to cure chronic illnesses. Modern medicine claims it decreases the chances of heart attacks and increases grey cell activity – good sex makes you healthier and more intelligent. It has even been proposed as a solution for climate change. According to Wilhelm Reich (a post World War II analyst), bad sex and pent up frustration caused a negative atmospheric layer that threatened to suffocate the world, and the only way to dissolve it was to blast it with ‘orgone energy’ (the energy of ‘superior orgasms’). But what is good sex and how does one achieve it? There is no one-size-fits-all formula. But the good news is we have an enormous potential for arousal. The human body is an unending feast of erogenous zones and the mind – which is the ultimate erogenous zone – has an infinite capacity for excitement. But good sex needs the indulgence of time and attention. If there were mobile phones in 300 AD, the Kama Sutra’s first mantra would have been to ‘leave them in the other room. And one is never too busy to make time for something you really want to do. Do not buy into the whole ‘who has the time for all this seduction nonsense’ – that is just the excuse of below-average lovers who do not have the energy and prowess to get their partners to the moon and back. Pleasure upon pleasure You are capable of feeling incredible pleasure – maybe not every single time – but certainly often enough to make it worth your while. That level of arousal and excitement and pleasure is the most fabulous feeling in the world. And the most addictive… Here are a few helpful hints from the Kama Sutra on how to elevate your lovemaking. Cushions An essential accessory for all lovers, the Kama Sutra recommends eight different shapes of cushions – crescent, round, square, rectangular etc. When placed under different parts of the body they change the angle and depth of penetration and this in turn changes the sensations that you will experience. Try it once. You will never look back. Tip: Do not place a pillow under your head. Love sounds Silence is for monks. Lovers need to express their arousal through sounds. It heightens the excitement of both partners equally. Tip: The Kama Sutra says love sounds are a great barometer of good sex. You know that things are going according to plan if your lover starts by making the guttural sounds of the pigeon which go up in pitch and urgency as desire mounts. The no-touch kiss Feather light touches build anticipation. Don’t grab, pull, force or slobber. Wrap a strand of her hair around your forefinger to hold her head in place – nothing more – and gently tease her lower lip with yours. Sustain it till she is desperate for more. Or hold him by his sleeve with the lightest touch. Tip: When there is just one point of bodily contact, you savour it more. The post-coital story What you do after sex defines how eagerly your partner looks forward to having sex with you the next time. A woman takes a very long time to cool down after her orgasm and what happens during this period will literally decide whether it was a pleasurable experience or not. The Kama Sutra says that after sex it’s time to cuddle and tell her stories of lovers who lived happily-ever-after; make her feel secure and happy. Tip: Post-coital intimacy will make up for anything that you don’t do particularly well in bed and she will go to sleep thinking you are the best lover in the world. No feasts before lovemaking You can go on the most romantic dinner – candlelight, oysters, champagne, red roses, all the flirting in the world. But you need energy to digest your food and you need energy to drive arousal. The body can only do one thing at a time, and if you have just eaten, it will automatically pick digestion. Tip: Figure out a clever after-dinner activity, and give it two hours at least. It will allow you to digest your dinner and increase the anticipation and excitement.

" Nasa’s most advanced space laser satellite blasted off Saturday on a mission to track ice loss around the world and improve forecasts of sea level rise as the climate warms. Cloaked in pre-dawn darkness, the $1 billion, half-ton ICESat-2 launched aboard a Delta II rocket from Vandenberg Air Force base in California at 6:02 am (1302 GMT). “Three, two one, liftoff!” said a launch commentator on Nasa television. “Lifting ICESat-2 on a quest to explore the polar ice sheets of our constantly changing home planet.” The launch marks the first time in nearly a decade that Nasa has had a tool in orbit to measure ice sheet surface elevation across the globe. The preceding mission, ICESat, launched in 2003 and ended in 2009. The first ICESat revealed that sea ice was thinning, and ice cover was disappearing from coastal areas in Greenland and Antarctica. In the intervening nine years, an aircraft mission called Operation IceBridge, has flown over the Arctic and Antarctic, taking height measurements of the changing ice. But a view from space -- especially with the latest technology -- should be far more precise. The new laser will fire 10,000 times in one second, compared to the original ICESat which fired 40 times a second. Measurements will be taken every 2.3 feet (0.7 meters) along the satellite’s path. “The mission will gather enough data to estimate the annual elevation change in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets even if it’s as slight as four millimeters - the width of a No. 2 pencil,” Nasa said in a statement. Importantly, the laser will measure the slope and height of the ice, not just the area it covers. “One of the things that we are trying to do is, one, characterize the change that is taking place within the ice, and this is going to greatly improve our understanding of that, especially over areas where we don’t know how well it is changing right now,” said Tom Wagner, cryosphere program scientist at Nasa, mentioning the deep interior of Antarctica as one such area of mystery."
        
              
         
       
                      
       
           
             
     
                         
         
       
         
         
       
       
       
         
         
               
         
                         
" Kerala is among the states that receive the highest monsoon rainfall, but sustained low-pressure conditions over India’s western coast this year have caused the flooding in the state, India Meteorological Department officials said. Different studies, however, have found that climate change and deforestation were the main causes of an increase in rainfall. Environmental scientist Dr VS Vijayan, a member of the expert panel on the Western Ghats, said Kerala was going through a man-made disaster. He said the impact should have been limited if the Gadgil committee report, aimed at protecting ecologically-fragile mountain ranges, was implemented. He attributed the floods to human incursions and unscientific developmental activities in ecologically-sensitive areas. “This was waiting to happen. Insensible use of land, soil and rocks led to this deluge. Landslips and flash floods happened in areas that witnessed widespread human incursions. I hope everyone will learn a lesson from this. Due to climate change, such tragedies are bound to increase. Nobody can stop rains or control floods. But we can take measures to lower the intensity of such impacts,” he said. A 2014 Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology study based on rainfall data since 1900 had said that intensity of the monsoon rains was increasing and one of the factors for it was global warming. Another 2017 IIT Bombay study held deforestation mainly responsible for the phenomenon. In 2010, the Centre set up an expert panel under Gadgil following widespread concern that the Western Ghats, which plays a key role in breaking rain clouds over the subcontinent, was shrinking due to human incursions.   When all six states falling under the Ghat region (Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra and Gujarat) opposed the recommendations , another committee was constituted under former ISRO chief Kasturirangan. Kasturirangan had made some changes in the zonal classification and reduced ecologically sensitive areas to 37% from 64%. But still many states opposed it saying people living in the fringe areas of Ghats will be thrown out of their habitat if the report was implemented. IMD’s senior scientist Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said the lowpressure situation of different levels was persisting over the Kerala-Karnataka coast for the last fortnight. “The low pressure in the Arabian Sea attracts the southwesterly winds from the high-pressure Bay of Bengal, gets concentrated over the region due to high moisture in the air and causes rain once it hits the Western Ghats,” he said.   Mohapatra said the two major low-pressure situations happened on August 7 and 13, causing heavy downpour in the region, apart from several other small similar situations since July last week. The region -- Kerala, coastal Karnataka and KonkanGoa -- has received 7,158 mm of rainfall, which was about 46% of the total rainfall received in rest of India during this monsoon . The IMD on Thursday said a low pressure system persisted off the Kerala coast over the Lakshadweep Islands, causing an eddying of the water vapour currents at different levels of the atmosphere leading to precipitation. More rain is predicted in the coming days."
" Despite having the largest number of critically polluted cities in India, Maharashtra added almost 2.5 GW of coal-fuelled power capacity in 2017, while overall, India commissioned 13 GW of thermal power plants from January 1, 2017 till August 9 this year. Barring two, none of the new plants or units meets the stricter thermal power plant emission standards laid down by the environment ministry in 2015. The issue of implementation of thermal power plant standards is now in the Supreme Court which has admonished the Centre for failing to implement standards and toying with public health. Chhattisgarh, another state that relies heavily on coal-fired plants, which contribute to 95% of the installed power capacity, also added 2.7 GW of capacity in thermal power stations, the highest for any state. Thermal power plants are an all-year-round source of air pollution, spewing particulate matter and oxides of sulphur and nitrogen, which produce secondary particulate matter. Burning of coal also produces greenhouse gases that disrupt climatic patterns. Mumbai is considered one of the most polluted metropolises in the world, and 16 other cities in Maharashtra feature on India’s most polluted cities list prepared by the Central Pollution Control Board. In 2015, the ministry of environment, forests and climate change notified stricter standards for thermal power plants that use coal, and these had to be met by December 2017. However, most existing thermal power plants did not meet the standards and have now been granted extensions, some of which stretch to 2022. As per the notification, power plants commissioned after Jan 1, 2017, have to meet the stricter norms from their date of commissioning. However, the power ministry has argued that since the environmental clearance was granted before the issue of the new norms in 2015, the plants would need time to install the pollution-mitigation equipment. “The environmental clearance for such TPPs was already accorded before issuance of new environmental norms by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change ,” RK Singh, power minister, told Parliament in the monsoon session. Activists disagree with this explanation. “The notification clearly states that all under-construction plants should also comply with norms. Also logically, it is easier to retrofit while the plant is under construction, rather than shutting down power plants after commissioning,” Nandikesh Sivalingam, an air pollution activist with Greenpeace, said."
            
" The regions of Mumbai, Thane, Dombivli and other cities in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) witnessed an increase in the concentration of Particulate Matter (PM) 10 (solid and liquid particles less than 10 microns suspended in the air), the Union environment ministry revealed. The data, collected from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) between the years 2015 and 2017 was released in the Lok Sabha last week. MPCB said the increase in PM 10 levels was a direct result of failure to control dust emissions from construction activities in MMR. “Transportation of construction material, condition of roads, and ready-mix-concrete plants (RMC) are also major factors for this rise,” said P Anbalagan, member secretary, MPCB. A senior Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) official, said, “The analysis of feedback reports from state pollution control boards showed that construction activity and open storage of construction material, traffic congestion, dumping of construction and solid waste, waste burning and road dust resuspension were major factors for rise in PM10.” In Mumbai, PM10 levels increased from 107 microgram per cubic metre (µg/m3) in 2015, to 119 µg/m3 in 2016 and 151µg/m3 in 2017, which is almost 2.5 times the annual safe limit for PM10, 60µg/m3. The regions of Thane, Dombivli and Ambernath also showed a similar trend. Navi Mumbai however, showed a declining trend during the same time. PM in air is a leading cause of deaths related to respiratory diseases. Most premature deaths in Mumbai over two decades were caused by stroke (a medical condition that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is cut off), due to inhalation of suspended particles such as PM10, revealed a study by the Indian Institute of Technology -Bombay (IITB) from 2017. Doctors said long-term inhalation of PM10 particles can cause the lungs to deteriorate and collapse. “We have witnessed a significant increase in the number of patients coming for treatment as a direct result of rise in particulate matter between 2015 and 2017. PM10 can enter lungs causing breathing disorders and damage lungs,” said Dr Sanjeev Mehta, pulmonologist, Lilavati Hospital in Bandra. In its reply to the Lok Sabha, the Union environment ministry listed steps taken to reduce air pollution across the cities, specifically for PM10 emissions. The MoEFCC official said, “We addressed all these issues under the recently formulated National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) for abatement of air pollution.” However, Sunil Dahiya, senior campaigner for Greenpeace said that the ministry failed to take strict action on reducing the sources of PM10 pollution. “The NCAP just talks about monitoring pollution and does not say anything about how pollution levels will be reduced. It does not provide time-bound targets for cities. The rate at which construction is increasing in MMR, levels will only be higher in coming years,” Dahiya said. For PM10, the System of Air quality Weather Forecasting and Research under the Ministry of Earth Sciences said that windblown suspended dust, mostly from construction activities, was responsible for 56.3% share of emissions in Mumbai"
            
           
     
                  
                    
       
" Lightning strikes claim more lives annually in India than other natural disasters such as floods and cyclones. They have turned deadlier over the years. Climate change is leading to extreme weather events such as storms, rain, heatwaves and lightning are getting more frequent and more intense, causing more deaths and destruction. However, while floods and heat waves that impact large swathes of the population attract the spotlight, lightning strikes that prove dangerous to individuals get less attention. The average number of people who died of lightning strikes every year between 2006 and 2015 was about 50% higher than the decade before, National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data shows. Taking into account population growth, the average deaths from lightning strikes per million people in 2006-2015 was 26% more than in 1996-2005. Part of the reason for the higher number is better reporting but the increasing number of lightning strikes could be playing a role, scientists from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology said. V Gopalkrishnan and his colleagues at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, examined satellite data for the period from 1990-2013, and found a 2-3% increase in lightning strikes. Lightning deaths are more common in rural areas where the presence of open spaces and outdoor work leads to more casualties. However, higher particulate matter pollution and loss of vegetation is also making urban areas more susceptible to lightning strikes. The researchers found that Aerial Optical Depth (AOD), which captures how much sunlight is obstructed from reaching the earth’s surface by aerosols, has a positive correlation with lightning strikes. More green cover also decreases the chances of a deadly lightning strike. “When aerosol loading increases in the atmosphere, it makes the cloud grow taller. If the vertical height of the cloud increases, there will be an increase in the charge separation or the distance between the positive and negative charge,” Gopalkrishnan explained. “The greater the charge separation, the greater the likelihood of a lightning strike,” he said. How climate change impacts lightning strikes is still not well understood. Abnormal surface-level heating that leads to the formation of deeper thunderstorm clouds, could be giving rise to more lightning strikes, the scientist said. However, not everybody is convinced that pollution is contributing to more lightning strikes. “Deep convective clouds have greater chance of lightning events, but it depends greatly on how the clouds are developing, how the internal charging takes place,” SN Tripathi, a scientist at IIT Kanpur, said. Monitoring lacunae Experts, however, agree that India is especially prone to lightning strikes and also fatalities, and not having a monitoring network and lack of awareness are costing lives. Barring a handful of states, there is no lighting monitoring network on the ground. “India is a very populous country – this certainly is a factor. But another very important factor is that India is a country where a lot of people work outdoors. These people are often caught in places that provide no proper shelter for safety when storms threaten,” Mark Hoekzema, chief meteorologist at Earth Networks, a US-based company that operates a global lightning detection network, said. “Another reason is the climate of India – being in the location it is on the earth, with a lot of heat and plenty of moisture from the Indian Ocean, it is an area that gets a lot of thunderstorms,” he said. IITM, which is under the earth sciences ministry, operates a lightning location network in Maharashtra. It is planning to expand this network, but some states like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, West Bengal, and most recently Odisha, have already signed agreements with Earth Networks to provide lightning monitoring services. “Spikes in the amount of in-cloud lightning are a known precursor to severe weather on the ground and can be used for severe weather prediction and alerting,” Hoekzema said. “Andhra Pradesh has become a customer of Earth Networks’ data earlier this year, and is using it with the help of its state disaster response agencies operating in the field to alert people about imminent lightning strikes up to around 30 minutes beforehand.”  "
         
           
        
" The environment ministry has approved the plan to increase the height of the Chhatrapati Shivaji statue, off the city coast, from 192m to 210m. A letter from the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate change (MoEFCC), dated June 15, to the chief engineer, public works department (PWD), released on the MoEFCC website on Friday, cleared the revised construction plans (made in October 2017) presented by the state’s PWD on April 22 with additional conditions. In the revised clearances, the Union government has directed the state to follow a new clause of corporate environment responsibility (CER) plan. Considering the proposal for amendment to the environmental and Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) rules on construction near the shore clearance, the letter signed by Kaushal Vashisht, director, MoEFCC, read, “Based on the information furnished by the project proponent and the expert appraisal committee (EAC) recommendations, the Ministry hereby accords amendment to environmental and CRZ clearance with additional conditions.” HT had reported on May 5 that while all previous conditions for environmental and CRZ clearances for the statue remain unchanged, EAC had directed the state to bring in additional clauses including a focus on marine conservation, a plan for management of fishing operations, during the construction, among other conditions. The CER plan stipulates creation of infrastructure for drinking water, sanitation, health, education, skill development, roads, and help to farmers in areas around the project. “The activities proposed under CER shall be restricted to the affected area. The monitoring report shall be submitted to the regional office as a part of a half-yearly compliance report, and to the district collector. It should be posted on the project website of the project proponent,” read the directions. Vinayak Mete, chairman of the committee that oversees implementation of the memorial project, said the revised clearances will be adhered to, but the Centre’s recommendations will be implemented only after a fresh letter, seeking permission to further increase the statue’s height by another two metres (212m), is sanctioned. The project is to construct a memorial – an oval-shaped basalt rocky outcrop - in the form of an equestrian statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj on a reclaimed island in the Arabian Sea in the Back Bay area.“There is no eco-sensitive area or national park or sanctuaries located within 10km of project area. There is no forest land involved in the project. The proposed site falls in CRZ IV ‘A’ area,” read the environment ministry letter. The revised plans also includes setting up of two breakwaters (a barrier to protect the coast from waves) towards north and south end of the site. Environmentalists said the new design would be disastrous for Mumbai’s coastline. “The Centre cannot give a revised clearance as the project parameters have changed completely. Apart from height modifications, the two breakwaters will cause significant change in project profile,” said Debi Goenka executive trustee of the environment group Conservation Action Trust, who has filed a petition in the Bombay high court regarding the project’s impact on marine."
" Wildlife Institute of India (WII) has radio collared two female swamp deer -- popularly called barasingha -- within a month in Jhilmil Jheel Conservation Reserve in Haridwar to study their movement along Ganga river and breeding pattern. Funded by the Uttarakhand forest department, the Dehradun-based institute received permission from the union environment forest and climate change (MoEFCC) ministry to radio collar six deers last year. The project titled ‘study on movement pattern and inbreeding status of swamp deer in Jhilmil Jheel’ started in 2016. In the first phase, experts took up genetic study on deer found along the river. It is a presumption that the specie, which is spotted in the conservation reserve from November till July, is likely to be breeding in Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh. During their study, the experts never reported presence of young ones in the reserve. Meanwhile, evidences of genetic exchange were also recorded in a few pockets between Hastinapur and the reserve. The specie is kept under ‘vulnerable’ category by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It is a Schedule I specie under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. “For us, it was important to know their breeding ground. If the specie is reaching in large number in Jhilmil then where is it going post monsoon? This question needed to be answered due to which we roped in WII,” said DVS Khati, the chief wildlife warden. Jhilmil reserve spreads across 3,783.500 hectare and has nearly 325 barasingha. GPS iridium collars were fitted on the neck of two female deer aged 3-4 years. The operation was headed by WII experts -- Parag Nigam, Vinod Thakur, Samrat Mondal and Bivash Pandav. The first deer was captured and radio collared on May 30. It left the conservation reserve on June 7 and is close to Hastinapur, the experts said. The second deer was collared on Friday. “The specie has immense ecological significance. As the monsoon sets in Uttarakhand, nearly 95% of the swamp deer used to vacate Jhilmil. There was a need to study about their calving habitat,” Pandav said. The rainfall has led to massive growth of shrubs around the reserve owing to which it seem difficult to radio collar more animals. But, as and when the climatic conditions will become favourable, they will attempt collaring for the remaining animals. In May, the National Green Tribunal issued notices to the MoEFCC and the UP government on a public interest litigation claiming that swamp deer is facing risk in Hastinapur."
" Addressing the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy in Athens, President Ram Nath Kovind laid out a vision that India and the EU could work together on. “India is committed to an international order marked by robust, rules-based multi-lateral institutions, by multi-polarity in international governance, and by investment and connectivity projects that are viable, sustainable, respect the sovereignty and territory of nations”, he said. His remarks on connectivity summed up India’s objection to China’s One Belt One Road project, a key part of which passes through Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. “This is the type of world India wants to hold up as a pillar of stability, and as a growing provider of developmental assistance to friendly countries. I am sure this is the type of world that Europe wants to nurture as well”, President Kovind said. “India and the EU are united in their commitment to the 2015 Paris Agreement. Addressing climate change and ensuring secure, affordable and sustainable supplies of energy are our priorities,” the President said. Talking about terrorism, he said “Pockets of instability and extremism can be found in the region to your east and our west. They are a worry for both Europe and India. Promotion of terrorism by state and non-state actors; extremism in a variety of forms and rooted in sense-less hate”, he said. He added India and the EU should prevail over the world to strengthen multi-lateral platforms such as the financial action task force."
" Actor Sanjai Mishra has always made it a point to balance both art house and commercial cinema. His recent movie, Kadwi Hava, (about climate change and how it affects the poor state of farmers ) recently did the rounds at many international film festivals. Kadwi Hava recently did the rounds of many international film festivals. Ask Sanjai if getting screened at these festivals helps small films, and he explains, “When I was small, in Bihar, my hometown, there used to be one thing called alsi (flaxseed). Whenever we used to come home from school, we would be given that to eat it with different types of rice... However, whenever any guests used to come home, they would be served basmati and not alsi.” Read more: Sanjai Mishra: Happy that people don’t know me by my name, but by my characters He goes on, “Today, we are being reminded of that alsi by the people from outside, who are selling it as flaxseeds. Similarly, one day will come when they will tell us that you have such good subjects, why were you searching for it all around? We always get to know the truth about us through others.” He reveals that Kadvi Hawa, though recognised internationally, wasn’t given fair treatment back home. Troubled by the fact that such small films don’t even get adequate screens, Sanjai further says, “I am a big fan of independent producers. People come into films to become actors, but these few people want to produce films, and that too not the ones, which will fetch them ₹200 crores. Let them, at least, earn ₹4-5 crore so that they can make one more such film.” His recently released film, Angrezi Mein Kehte Hain, was shot in the interior parts of India. What’s surprising is that it too, didn’t get many theatres. “Hamari picture Banares mein shoot hui hai, aur Banares mein hi screens nahi mili…wow! Main Bihar ka hoon, mere dost, jaane-waale Kadwi Hawa nahi dekh paaye, wahaan jaayengi vaisi filmein jo aapki so-called Dhamaal hoti hain. (Our film was shot in Benares, and it didn’t get screens even there! I am from Bihar, and my friends and acquaintances there didn’t get to see Kadvi Hawa. There, only films like your so-called Dhamaal will be able to reach),” he signs off."
" The unusually high concentration of particulate matter in the last few days in north India clearly shows that air pollution is not a seasonal problem anymore. As the climate gets warmer and frequency of rains reduces, such spurts in coarse particles making breathing difficult will become a new normal, unless governments wake up to the alarm. The latest assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says that the planet can bear only up to a 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius increase in temperature from pre-industrial era levels. The world had already warmed by 0.9 degrees Celsius till 2015 and at the present pace of emissions, climate scientists say, the IPCC mark will get breached latest by 2050, if not earlier. The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), in series of papers, said that both the periodicity and duration of dry spells in the country were rising as total rainfall events in a year had fallen even though the average rainfall in a year has not changed much, a direct consequence of climate change. The annual average rainfall has remained the same because the frequency of heavy downpours (for example, the June 2013 flash floods in Uttarakhand) has increased in the past two decades. During dry spells, the earth gets heated up and moisture in the atmosphere dips, creating depressions that pull winds from the oceans. As there is less rain, and green barriers in and around cities have been destroyed by urbanisation, the winds lift dust and local emissions, causing a spurt in air pollution. Such events have been higher in 2018 — a year of freaky weather that witnessed three killer thunderstorms in May before this dust-laden westerly — because the average rainfall since November 2017 has been about 60% below normal. But the impact could have been substantially reduced had governments — the states and Centre — made air pollution mitigation a round-the-clock exercise, and not restricted it to winter months, when pollution levels are high. As a result, most of north India is covered under a thick blanket of dust haze with air pollution worse than in the winter months. On Thursday, the peak particulate matter pollution around Delhi University and Mathura Road crossed 1,400 micro grams in a cubic metre of air, close to 20 times the Indian safety standard. Even in places such as Jodhpur in Rajasthan and Panchkula in Haryana, the PM levels were close to 1,000. And this has remained constant for the past 48 hours. Blaming only weather conditions would be a colossal mistake. It is a man-made catastrophe that impacts health of one and all, as half of the air pollution spurt is caused by local dust in the absence of proper roadside landscaping and emissions from industry and vehicles."
" Protests against Vedanta’s Sesa Sterlite Copper Smelter Plant’s expansion plans and persistent pollution of air and water sources must be examined against another impending blow to environmental governance on a nationwide scale. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MOEFCC), proposes to bring about changes to the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification, by bringing in yet another notification – the CRZ 2018. Can this law help prevent other Sterlite-like incidents? Sterlite, which was set up in 1996, falls well outside the CRZ, a narrow 500-metre band of land meant to be regulated by a law that was first introduced in 1991 under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The proposed expansion plans for Sterlite depend on inputs like coke that are either imported by the neighbouring port of Tuticorin or supplied (such as water from the desalination plants located on the coast ). Establishments under the State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu (SIPCOT) are located on the coast for two primary reasons. One, it facilitates easy discharge of effluents into the coastal waters and second, proximity to port areas facilitates port-based industrial development. In India, most coal-based thermal power plants gravitated close to port areas since thermal-grade coal could be imported. The CRZ law has always been attentive to the concerns of port-related establishments, declaring that these were essential activities requiring the foreshore and waterfront. The spirit of the CRZ 1991 notification was to ensure the ‘regulation of activities, industries and processes’ along the coast. This law was amended over 25 times, and in 2011 was completely replaced by the CRZ, 2011, which itself saw multiple amendments. When the CRZ was first introduced, its spirit was to limit activities on the coast — only those which were essential. The initial 1991 notification saw port-based activities as being essential; after all, they could not be located anywhere else in the hinterland. The notification allowed construction of limited facilities, infrastructure and equipment which was essential for transactions that take place within a port. These included storage of oil, fertilisers, hazardous substances and also dredging works and land reclamation for erosion control. Over a period of time, a number of other activities have been declared by the ministry as being essential to the coast, which covers activities such as exploration of oil and natural gas (amended on April 12, 2001), strategic and defence-related port and harbour works (amended on January 6, 2011 ) and pipelines and transmission lines (amended on April 12, 2001). The spirit of limiting activities has been replaced by a spirit of opening up the coast to all. Therefore, while industries and industrial complexes such as SIPCOT occupied the areas outside the 500m periphery, their life-links to ports continued to thrive thanks to the CRZ notification’s partiality to ports. Amendments now permit desalination plants and allow sewage and effluent treatment within the CRZ. A new trend in SIPCOT is to include desalination plants within the limits of its ‘industrial complexes’ and to propose such complexes within the coastal zone, given the scarcity of water in many hinterland areas of Tamil Nadu. The environmental impact assessment for Sesa Sterlite’s expansion plans says that it will acquire much of its water needs from desalination plants (now permitted within the CRZ) and can thus make a bold claim that they will be the world’s fourth largest producer of copper, with an eye on exporting the coveted metal to markets in West Asia. The new CRZ notification permits all these ‘essential’ activities but fails on one important count. The 1991 notification stated that polluting activities and disposal of waste waters and industrial effluents were to be phased out within three years from that notification. Absolutely no action was taken in two decades of its existence. None of the 25 amendments sought to strengthen this aspect of the law and not a single Coastal Zone Management Plan devoted even a single sentence to how to address the deadline based phase-out. The 2011 notification introduced new deadlines for phasing out sewage, waste water and effluent disposal and even allowed industries to set up sewage treatment plants within the CRZ. Both the 1991 and the 2011 notification did not contain any provisions on how these aspects were to be operated, monitored, implemented; who would be in charge and what might be the penalties. They merely had deadlines that were routinely ignored. The new 2018 notification is not only silent on affixing responsibility for various regulations on specific authorities, but it has removed altogether any deadlines for achieving its purpose. CRZ 2018 will usher in a new era of environmental lapses by industry; which may spark off other protests in India’s other port towns.

" India accounts for one-fourth of the total groundwater extracted globally, more than that of China and US combined and cities and villages in the northern and central parts of India are among regions facing a water crisis, says an analysis by WaterAid. A total of 163 million people in India have no access to clean water close to home, or 15% of all rural residents and seven per cent of all urban residents, says the study,released on the occasion of world environment day today. Severe groundwater depletion in north and central India, already home to some of the poorest communities, further threatens their access to water, it said. “The country accounts for one-fourth of the total groundwater extracted globally, more than the water extracted by China and the United States combined. Severe groundwater depletion in the north and central India, already home to some of the poorest communities, further threatens their access to water,” it says. Because of climate change, India has experienced extreme weather events in the past few years - excessive rainfall, increased incidence of floods and drought. Every year, lack of access to clean water adversely affects the quality of life, particularly of the poorest, further setting them back, said WaterAid. The most marginalised people who have contributed least to climate change are impacted the most, it says. As per UNICEF-WHO joint monitoring programme, clean water refers to water from an improved source, collected within a 30-minute round trip. The study said that besides these cities and villages in India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, southern Madagascar and southern Mozambique are facing acute water scarcity threatening the lives and livelihoods of millions. Based on NASA satellite imagery released earlier this year, the analysis also examined current rates of access to water for rural and urban areas in most-affected regions. While other areas like northern Australia and California also face serious groundwater depletion, it is the world’s poorest regions and nations which will feel the strongest impact, as their people already have low levels of access to clean water close to home, it says. Avinash Kumar,director- programmes and policy, WaterAid India, said the government needs to approach the issue holistically by ensuring stringent steps to reduce pollution of water bodies, prevent excessive groundwater exploitation, promote water recharge measures like rainwater harvesting, treat wastewater, promote its use for non-critical service and ensure climate-resilient water sector planning. Schemes like AMRUT and ‘Har Ghar Jal’ are steps in the right direction to ensure piped water access to every household, but India has a long way to go to ensure that the installed taps do not run dry soon, he said in a release."

KNOT FOR KEEPS; WRITING THE MODERN MARRIAGE EDITED BY SATHYA SARAN What holds two people together for life, sometimes across continents? What drives them apart even as they share their lives under the same roof? What makes marriage the only socially acceptable goal of a relationship? Are women and men exploring other forms of being in a relationship? Why are more and more marriages failing? In a society where not being married is now respectable, where getting divorced is a natural solution to discord and where traditional gender roles have lost meaning – marriage is no longer the institution it once was. Through Sharanya Manivannan’s poignant essay on loneliness, Kalyan Ray’s account of his two-decade-long marriage to Aparna Sen, Prasoon Joshi’s evocative poem, Chitra Viraraghavan’s cheeky story on infidelity and many others, Knot for Keeps takes a hard look at the many attributes and changing dynamics of the modern marriage. THE CLIMATE SOLUTION BY MRIDULA RAMESH From fatal heatwaves and cruel droughts to devastating floods and fast-depleting water tables, climate change is the greatest disruptor of our time – and it can no longer be ignored. For most of us the odds seem overwhelming and solutions out of reach. Yet, in this forcefully argued book, climate–change practitioner, teacher and investor Mridula Ramesh emphasizes that while the situation is grim, it is not without hope. Drawing on her extensive practical and investing experience, she explores myriad faces of this raging issue: Why women are peculiarly affected by a warming climate; how climate change poses a security threat to the Indian state; why just focusing on green sources of power is an incomplete solution for India; how managing waste can create lakhs of urban jobs; and how households can cope in a ‘Day Zero’ water situation. In doing so, she shows how climate warriors, from the cotton fields of Punjab and thriving eco start-ups in Bengaluru to a forest guardian in Assam and the johads of Rajashtan, have employed ingenuity and initiative to adapt to the changing conditions – and sometimes reverse their shattering effects."
                  
                          
                    
           
        
        
  
" Leopard poaching at Rajaji Tiger Reserve in Uttarakhand has raised security worries, prompting the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) to take a call on translocation of big cats to the reserve, said officials associated with the project. NTCA, the apex body on issues related to tigers, is likely to seek details about the poaching incident from state authorities. The member secretary of NTCA will hold a meeting this week to discuss the future course of action on the translocation project. “I returned from a travel today and will be discussing the issues at Rajaji with the officers here. Tiger protection is our primary concern and we won’t allow threats to the species,” said NTCA member secretary Anup Kumar Nayak, who joined on March 18. The leopard poaching incident was reported on March 22 from Motichur range – the core area of the reserve where tiger translocation was planned. The initial plan is to bring three tigers (one male and two female) from the Corbett landscape to the western part of the Rajaji reserve that has two tigresses and has not reported breeding, officials said. The eastern part has 32 tigers. Both the parts are divided by a narrow busy corridor that blocks movement of tigers. NTCA and the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) had given nod to the project, which is technically supervised by Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII). But the project faces uncertainty after the poaching incident punched holes in protection strategies. Experts are also concerned over the threats to wild animals inside the reserve that spreads across 1075 sq km area. “We need to strengthen tiger protection so that translocated tigers should not become susceptible to poaching,” WII director VB Mathur said. “All tiger-populated areas should be carefully guarded from wildlife criminals.” Two people surrendered before a Dehradun court in the poaching case on May 2. The reserve management had earlier nabbed a man who worked as an informer for officials. Forest officials are looking for two more accused in connection with the incident. “One was arrested, two surrendered and two others are absconding. We will ask for remand of those who surrendered; they belong to the kanjar basti in Haripurkala, close to the spot from where leopard parts were recovered,” Rajaji director Sanatan Sonkar said. Head of forest force (HoFF) Jai Raj has made whistleblower IFS officer Sanjeev Chaturvedi in-charge of the probe into the poaching incident. Officials close to the probe said the Rajaji director is likely to move the Uttarakhand High Court at Nainital, seeking quashing of HoFF’s order. The chief wildlife warden (CWW) had earlier demanded a SIT probe into the poaching."
     
         
           
         
" A day after the Union environment ministry issued the draft Coastal Zone Regulation Notification, 2018, city-based environmentalists said that the new rules will put coastal ecosystems along Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) at risk from construction activities. Recommending several changes to the existing rules from 2011, effectively easing norms regarding development in coastal areas, the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) notified the draft Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) 2018 guidelines on Wednesday and called for comments of the public and stakeholders over the next 60 days. “The draft has been prepared for India’s 7,500km coastline based on recommendations by a committee under the chairmanship of Dr Shailesh Nayak, all coastal states, and various other stakeholders. It encompasses protection of ecologically sensitive areas, safeguarding aquatic system and marine life, plastic waste disposal, and simultaneously allowing ecotourism and development of coastal zones,” said a senior official from MoEFCC. “Based on suggestions and objections from the public, a committee under the ministry along with Dr Nayak will study the draft again, and only then will a final notification be issued. The process will take time.” Some of the significant changes as per the draft are that the applicability of CRZ distance to the land area or width of the creek from the high tide line (HTL) is now 50 metres, which has been reduced from the earlier limit of 100 metres buffer zone. While exemptions in CRZ-IA areas (classified as most sensitive coastal zone) where no development activities shall be permitted to be carried out, on mangroves located in private land, no buffer zone is required to be kept anymore. Eco-tourism activities such as mangrove walks, tree huts, nature trails, and so on will be allowed in these areas through the development of coastal zone management plans (CZMPs) and public consultation. Environmentalists, irked by the developments, have already begun submitting suggestions and objections to the draft. “The distance between HTL and land area reduction was originally 500 metres prior to the CRZ rules in 2011, which has now been brought down to 50m. All the builders in MMR can rejoice as they now have another 50m strip to play around with just before the elections,” said Debi Goenka, environmentalist and executive trustee of the Conservation Action Trust. Some of the other major provisions are that applicability of the current floor space index (FSI) rule will apply in CRZ II areas (developed land areas up to or close to the shoreline in designated urban areas). “This means that as against the earlier FSI of 1.33 for the island city and 1 for the suburbs, the new rules will allow developers to build up to an FSI of 4. With the new development plan, this might increase further,” said Goenka. CRZ III areas have been divided into two categories — CRZ III a and b, wherein for CRZ III a, the distance between the HTL and land has been reduced from 200m to 50m. “Dr Nayak’s committee report was one-sided and there was no consultation, therefore a completely one-sided draft notification has been issued. Ministry is protecting the builder’s interest rather than the environment,” said Goenka. City-based advocates pointed out that the slum rehabilitation schemes (SRA) where developers were required to offer 51% stake to parastatal entities has been completely done away to please the builder lobby. “A total 26.32% of the total area of Greater Mumbai is affected by CRZ, and this notification is nothing but a gift for developers. The 50m distance rule will put lot of strain on the development particularly in ecologically sensitive areas such as Manori, Malad, Mahim creeks along the western suburbs, and Thane (Thane creek flamingo sanctuary), Mahul creek in the eastern suburbs and Vasai creek, north of Mumbai,” said Godfrey Pimenta, lawyer and trustee, NGO Watchdog Foundation. Pimenta added that the protection offered in CRZ notification 2011 to the fishing community (Koliwadas) has been ignored in this notification. “The only positive thing this draft points out to is disposal of plastic into the coastal waters, which shall be prohibited through adequate measures for management and disposal of plastic in CRZ,” said Pimenta. Stalin D, director, NGO Vanashakti, said, “Now, the environment protection act is being rewritten as the builders protection act. It has been introduced exclusively to allow destruction of coastal areas in Maharashtra, specifically in areas such as Palghar, Vasai, Mira-Bhayander, Virar, Uran. They entire document is committed towards opening up all protected areas for development as elections draw near. If this draft is notified, we will have to challenge it in court.” OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS MADE AS PART OF THE DRAFT COASTAL REGULATION ZONE (CRZ) 2018 NOTIFICATION The new draft CRZ notification has major recommendations that will boost tourism development in coastal areas of the country, which remains untapped due to stringent regulatory framework. • CRZ areas falling within municipal limits of Greater Mumbai: In order to protect and preserve green areas of Greater Mumbai, all open spaces, parks, gardens, playgrounds indicated in development plans within CRZ-II shall be categorised as ‘No Development Zone’ (NDZ) • In the CRZ II areas as well, the proposed guidelines recommends development of vacant plots in designated areas for construction of beach resorts and hotels subject to guidelines. Temporary tourism facilities shall be permissible in the beaches falling in CRZ II areas • In areas falling under CRZ III, wherever there is a national or state highway passing through the NDZ of CRZ III areas, temporary tourism facilities such as toilets, change rooms, drinking water facility and temporary shacks can be taken up on the seaward side of the road • Construction of beach resorts or hotels shall not be permitted in ecologically sensitive areas (such as marine parks, mangroves, coral reefs, breeding and spawning grounds of fish, wildlife habitats and such other area as may be notified by the central or state government, Union territories) • Construction of sewage treatment plants in CRZ-I area for the purpose of treating the sewage from the municipal area shall be taken only by the municipal authorities in exceptional circumstances, where no alternate site is available to set up such facilities, subject to recommendations of the coastal authority and approval by the central government • In case the construction of such plant is inevitable in a mangrove area, a minimum three times the mangrove area affected/destroyed /cut during the construction process shall be taken up for compensatory plantation of mangroves (it was five times in the 2011 notification) HOW TO SUBMIT SUGGESTIONS, OBJECTIONS"
             
               
             
          
           
" The Sahara Desert has expanded by about 10% since 1920 partly due to human-caused climate change, say researchers including one of Indian-origin. The findings of their study, published in the Journal of Climate, suggest that other deserts could be expanding as well. “Our results are specific to the Sahara, but they likely have implications for the world’s other deserts,” said senior author of the study Sumant Nigam, an atmospheric and ocean scientist at University of Maryland in the US. Deserts are defined by low average annual rainfall -- usually 100 millimetres of rain per year or less. The researchers analysed annual rainfall data recorded throughout Africa from 1920 to 2013 and found that the Sahara, which occupies much of the northern part of the continent, expanded by 10% during this period. When the scientists looked at seasonal trends over the same period, the most notable expansion of the Sahara occurred in summer, resulting in a nearly 16% increase in the desert’s average area over the 93-year span covered by the study. The results suggest that human-caused climate change, as well as natural climate cycles, caused the desert’s expansion. The geographic pattern of expansion varied from season to season, with the largest differences along the Sahara’s northern and southern boundaries, the study said. “Deserts usually form in the subtropics because of what’s called Hadley circulation, through which air rises at the equator and descends in the subtropics,” Nigam, an alumnus of Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur (IIT-Kanpur), said. That circulation has a drying effect. “Climate change is likely to widen this Hadley circulation, causing the northward advance of subtropical deserts,” he added."
